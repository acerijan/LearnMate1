Logistic tree normal model for micro biome compositions Zhuo qu Wang Jia liang Mao Li Ma Duke University Linked In Corporation Duke University Durham NC Sunnyvale CA Durham NC June Abstract We introduce probabilistic model called the logistic tree normal LT for micro biome compositional data The LT marries two popular classes of models the logistic normal LN and the Di rich let tree DT and inherits the key be nets of both LN models are ex ble in characterizing rich co variance structure among taxa but can be computationally prohibitive in face of high dimensionality when the number of taxa is large due to its lack of con ju gacy to the multi no mi al sampling model On the other hand the DT avoids this issue by decomposing the multi no mi al sampling model into collection of binomial models one at each split of the phylogenetic tree of the taxa and adopting conjugate beta model for each binomial probability but at the same time the DT incurs restrictive co variance among the taxa In contrast the LT model decomposes the multi no mi al model into binomials as the DT does but it jointly models the corresponding binomial probabilities using multivariate LN distribution instead of betas It therefore allows rich co variance structures as the LN models while the binomial decomposition of the multi no mi al likelihood allows con ju gacy to be restored through the Polya Gamma augmentation Accordingly Bayesian inference on the LT model can readily proceed by Gibbs sampling Moreover the multivariate Gaussian aspect of the model allows common techniques for eec ti ve inference on high dimensional data such as those based on sparsity and low rank assumptions in the co variance structure to be readily incorporated Depending on the goal of the analysis the LT model can be used either as standalone model or embedded into more sophisticated hierarchical models We demonstrate its use in estimating taxa co variance and in ii mixed eec ts modeling Finally we carry out case study using an LT based mixed eec ts model to analyze longitudinal data set from the cohort of the DIAB IMMUNE project Email li ma duke edu

JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES VOL NO AUGUST CF Simple Framework for ELF Self supervised Collaborative Filtering in Zhou Aix in Sun Yong Liu Jie Zhang and Chun yan Miao Abstract Collaborative lte ring CF is widely used to learn an informative latent representation of user or item from observed interactions Existing CF based methods commonly adopt negative sampling to discriminate different items That is observed user item pairs are treated as positive instances unobserved pairs are considered as negative instances and are sampled under de ned distribution for training Training with negative sampling on large datasets is computationally expensive Further negative items should be carefully sampled under the de ned distribution in order to avoid selecting an observed positive item in the training data set Unavoidably some negative items sampled from the training data set could be positive in the test set Recently self supervised learning SSL has emerged as powerful tool to learn model without negative samples In this paper we propose self supervised collaborative lte ring framework SELF CF that is specially designed for recommend er scenario with implicit feedback The proposed SELF CF frameworks implies the Siamese networks and can be easily applied to existing deep learning based CF models which we refer to as backbone networks The main idea of SELF CF is to augment the output embedding generated by backbone networks because it is infeasible to augment raw input of user itemid We propose and study three output perturbation techniques that can be applied to different types of backbone networks including both traditional CF models and graph based models The framework enables ul learning informative representations of users and items without negative samples and is agnostic to the encapsulated backbones By encapsulating two popular recommendation models into the framework our experiments on three datasets show that the best performance of our framework is comparable or better than the supervised counterpart We also show that SELF CF can boost up the performance by up to on average compared with another self supervised framework as the baseline Source codes are available at https it hub com enoch Self CF Index Terms Collaborative Filtering Self supervised Learning Recommend er Systems Siamese Networks cid

On Two Pass Streaming Algorithms for Maximum Bipartite Matching Christian Konrad and heer an Nai du Department of Computer Science University of Bristol UK christian konrad heer an nai du bristol ac uk Abstract We study two pass streaming algorithms for Maximum Bipartite Matching MB All known two pass streaming algorithms for MB operate in similar fashion They compute maximal matching in the rst pass and nd augmenting paths in the second in order to augment the matching found in the rst pass Our aim is to explore the limitations of this approach and to determine whether current techniques can be used to further improve the state of the art algorithms We give the following results We show that every two pass streaming algorithm that solely computes maximal matching cs in the rst pass and outputs cid approximation requires log og space for every cid where is the number of vertices of the input graph This result is obtained by extending the Ruz Sze mere di graph construction of Go el et al SODA so as to ensure that the resulting graph has close to perfect matching the key property needed in our construction This result may be of independent interest Furthermore we combine the two main techniques sub sampling followed by the Greedy matching algorithm Konrad MFC which gives approximation and the computation of degree bounded semi matching Esf and ari et al ICD MW Kale and Tiro kar APPROX which gives approximation and obtain meta algorithm that yields Konrad and Esf and ari et al algorithms as special cases This unies two strands of research By optimizing parameters we discover that Konrad algorithm is optimal for the implied class of algorithms and perhaps surprisingly that there is second optimal algorithm We show that the analysis of our meta algorithm is best possible Our results imply that further improvements if possible require new techniques

Faster Matching via Learned Dual Michael Di nitz Sung in Im Thomas Lavas tid Benjamin Moseley Sergei Vas sil its kii July Abstract recent line of research investigates how algorithms can be augmented with machine learned predictions to overcome worst case lower bounds This area has revealed interesting algorithmic insights into problems with particular success in the design of competitive online algorithms However the question of improving algorithm running times with predictions has largely been unexplored We take rst step in this direction by combining the idea of machine learned predictions with the idea of warm starting primal dual algorithms We consider one of the most important primitives in combinatorial optimization weighted bipartite matching and its generalization to matching We identify three key challenges when using learned dual variables in primal dual algorithm First predicted dual may be infeasible so we give an algorithm that cie ntl maps predicted infeasible dual to nearby feasible solutions Second once the dual are feasible they may not be optimal so we show that they can be used to quickly nd an optimal solution Finally such predictions are useful only if they can be learned so we show that the problem of learning dual for matching has low sample complexity We validate our theoretical dings through experiments on both real and synthetic data As result we give rigorous practical and empirically eec ti ve method to compute bipartite matching

The Real Meaning of Quantum Mechanics Francois Igor Pris Abstract suggest contextual realist interpretation of Carlo Rove ll is relational quantum mechanics The principal point is correct understanding of the concept of reality and taking into account the categorical distinction between the ideal and the real Within my interpretation consciousness of the observer does not play any metaphysical role The proposed approach can also be understood as return to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics corrected within the framework of contextual realism The contextual realism allows one to get rid of the metaphysical problems encountered by various interpretations of quantum mechanics including the relational one wave function neither literally reflects an exterior reality nor is it merely predictive mathematical tool In particular an entangled wave function can be viewed as the formal cause of quantum correlations whose reality is contextual The reduction of wave function is not real physical process And there are no autonomous quantum events which would be different from the facts of their representation The quantum measurement problem results from confusion between the categories of the ideal and the real It is dissolved logically The quantum theory plays the role of Wittgenstein ian rule norm measuring physical reality within language game of its application Keywords relational quantum mechanics contextual realism Wittgenstein ian rule quantum correlation quantum measurement problem

Winning the Ransom ware Lottery Game Theoretic Model for Mitigating Ransom ware Attacks Erick Ga linkin Rapid Boston MA USA erick ga linkin rapid com Abstract Ransom ware is growing threat to individuals and enter rises like constituting major factor in cyber insurance and in the security planning of every organization Although the game theoretic lens often frames the game as competition between equals prot maximizing attacker and loss minimizing defender the reality of many situations is that ransom ware organizations are not playing an on cooperative game they are playing lottery The want on behavior of attackers creates situation where many victims are hit more than once by ransom ware operators sometimes even by the same group If defend ers wish to combat malware they must then seek to remove the incentives of it In this work we construct an expected value model based on data from actual ransom ware attacks and identify three variables the value of pay ment the cost of an attack and the probability of payment Using this model we consider the potential to manipulate these variables to re duce the prot motive associated with ransom ware attack Based on the model we present mitigation to encourage an environment that is hos tile to ransom ware operators In particular wend that site backups and government incentives for their adoption are the most fruitful avenue for combating ransom ware Keywords Security Malware Economics Ransom ware Incentives Backups

QUADRIC BUNDLES AND HYPERBOLIC EQUIVALENCE ALEXANDER KU NETS OV Abstract We introduce the notion of hyperbolic equivalence for quadric bundles and show that hy per boli equivalent quadric bundles share many important properties they have the same Brauer data moreover if they have the same dimension over the base they are bi rational over the base and have equal classes in the Gro then die ck ring of varieties Furthermore when the base is projective space we show that two quadric bundles are hyperbolic equivalent if and only if their co kernel sheaves are isomorphic up to twist their be rs over ed point of the base are Witt equivalent and in some cases certain quadratic forms on intermediate cohomology groups of the underlying vector bundles are Witt equivalent For this we show that any quadric bundle over Pn is hyperbolic equivalent to quadric bundle whose underlying vector bundle has many cohomology vanishings this class of bundles called VLC bundles in the paper is interesting by itself

Deep learning enables accurate sound redistribution via non local meta surfaces Hua Ding in sheng Fang Bin Jia Neng yin Wang Qian Cheng and Yong Li Institute of Acoustics School of Physics Science and Engineering Tong ji University Shanghai China Dated August Abstract Conventional acoustic meta surfaces are constructed with gradient ly local phase shift roles provided by subunits The local strategy implies the ignorance of the mutual coupling between subunits which limits the efc ien cy of targeted sound manipulation especially in complex environments By taking into account the non local interaction among subunits non local meta surface offers an opportunity for accurate control of sound propagation but the requirement of the consideration of gathering coupling among all subunits not just the nearest neighbor coupling greatly increases the complexity of the system and therefore hinders the explorations of functionalities of non local meta surfaces In this work empowered by deep learning algorithms the complex gathering coupling can be learned efc ent ly from the preset data set so that the functionalities of non local meta surfaces can be sign cant ly uncovered As an example we demonstrate that non local meta surfaces which can redirect an incident wave into multi channel re ect ions with rbi tr ary energy ratios can be accurately predicted by deep learning algorithms Compared to the theory the relative error of the energy ratios is less than Furthermore experiments witness three channel re ect ion with three types of energy ratios of and proving the validity of the deep learning enabled non local meta surfaces Our work might blaze new trail in the design of acoustic functional devices especially for the cases containing complex wave matter interactions

multi scale bio physical model gives quantized meta chron al waves in lattice of cilia Brato Chakra bart Sebastian Furt hauer and Michael Shelley Center for Computational Biology Flatiron Institute New York NY USA Cour ant Institute New York University New York NY USA Dated August Motile cilia are slender hair like cellular appendages that spontaneously oscillate under the action of internal molecular motors and are typically found in dense arrays These active laments coordinate their beating to generate meta chron al waves that drive long range id transport and locomotion Until now our understanding of their collective behavior largely comes from the study of minimal models that coarse grain the relevant biophysics and the hydrodynamics of slender structures Here we build on detailed bio physical model to elucidate the emergence of meta chron al waves on millimeter scales from nanometer scale motor activity inside individual cilia Our study of lattice of cilia in the presence of hydro dynamic and steric interactions reveals how meta chron al waves are formed and maintained Wend that in homogeneous beds of cilia these interactions lead to multiple attracting states all of which are characterized by an integer charge that is conserved This even allows us to design initial conditions that lead to predictable emergent states Finally and very importantly we show that in non uniform ciliary tissues boundaries and in homo gene ties provide robust route to meta chron al waves Motile cilia are thin hair like cellular projections that Hydro dynamic interactions are uci ent to explain serve as fundamental building blocks of locomotion and the collective behavior in such minimal models for il material transport in many eukaryotes Each cilium is ary arrays

Bayesian optimal designs for choice experiments with mixtures Mario Bec err and Peter Goo Faculty of Bioscience Engineering KU Leuven Leuven Belgium Faculty of Business and Economics Universit it Antwerpen Antwerpen Belgium August Abstract Discrete choice experiments are frequently used to quantify consumer preferences by having respondents choose between die rent alternatives Choice experiments involving mixtures of ingredients have been largely overlooked in the literature even though many products and services can be described as mixtures of ingredients As consequence little research has been done on the optimal design of choice experiments involving mixtures The only existing research has focused on optimal designs which means that an estimation based approach was adopted However in experiments with mixtures it is crucial to obtain models that yield precise predictions for any combination of ingredient proportions This is because the goal of mixture experiments generally is to nd the mixture that optimizes the respondents utility As result the optimal it criterion is more suitable for designing choice experiments with mixtures than the optimal it criterion because the optimal it criterion focuses on getting precise predictions with the estimated statistical model In this paper we study Bayesian optimal designs compare them with their Bayesian optimal counterparts and show that the former designs perform substantially better than the latter in terms of the variance of the predicted utility Keywords Choice experiment optimal it Mixture coordinate exchange algorithm Mixture experiment Multi no mi al log it model chee models

Non contact friction The role of ph on on damping and its non universality Mir Lee Richard Vink Cynthia Volker and Matthias rger Institute for Theoretical Physics Georg August Universit ttingen ttingen Germany Institute of Materials Physics Georg August Universit ttingen ttingen Germany Dated August While obtaining theoretical predictions for dissipation during sliding motion is adi cult task one regime that allows for analytical results is the so called non contact regime where probe is weakly interacting with the surface over which it moves Studying this regime for model crystal we extend previously obtained analytical results and con rm them quantitatively via particle based computer simulations Accessing the subtle regime of weak coupling in simulations is possible via use of Green Kubo relations The analysis allows to extract and compare the two paradigmatic mechanisms that have been found to lead to dissipation ph on on radiation prevailing even in purely elastic solid and ph on on damping caused by viscous motion of crystal atoms While ph on on radiation is dominant at large probe surface distances ph on on damping dominates at small distances Ph on on radiation is furthermore pairwise additive phenomenon so that the dissipation due to interaction with die rent parts areas of the surface adds up This additive scaling results from general one to one mapping between the mean probe surface force and the friction due toph on on radiation irrespective of the nature of the underlying pair interaction In contrast ph on on damping is strongly non additive and no such general relation exists We show that for certain cases the dissipation can even decrease with increasing surface area the probe interacts with The above properties which are rooted in the spatial correlations of surface uc tu at ions are expected to have important consequences when interpreting experimental measurements as well as scaling with system size
