Quantum mechanics vs local realism is that the question Emilio Santos Depart men to de Fi sica Universidad de Cantabria Santander Spain July Abstract The conjecture is made that quantum mechanics is compatible with local hidden variables or local realism The conjecture seems to be ruled out by the theoretical argument of Bell but it is supported by the empirical fact that nobody has been able to perform loophole free test of local realism in spite of renewed ort during almost years During the last three decades many experiments have been performed aimed at ruling out any local hidden variables LH theory In spite of the ort some dec ien cie in the proof remain the most important being described by locality and detector ec ien cy loopholes According to recent reports the two loopholes have been closed However each loophole has been closed in die rent experiment That this is not enough to refute all LH theories has been pointed out by aid man agree with that paper except for point which will be commented below Therefore shall not spent time in repeating the arguments which may be summarized as follows The existence of loophole means that quantum mechanics and LH are actually compatible for the experiment and therefore the experiment is unable to discriminate between quantum mechanics and LH theories The fact that quantum predictions are ve ried certainly reinforces our belief in the correctness of quantum theory But the experiment says nothing against LH theories

Bernoulli Sieve Alexander ned in Department of Mathematics Utrecht University Post bus TA Utrecht The Netherlands Abstract Bernoulli sieve is recursive construction of random composition ordered partition of integer This composition can be induced by sampling from random discrete distribution which has frequencies equal to the sizes of component intervals of stick breaking interval partition of We exploit Markov property of the composition and its renewal representation to derive asymptotic of the moments and to prove central limit theorem for the number of parts The Bernoulli sieve can be seen as generalisation of the game found in The rst round of the game starts with players and amounts to tossing coin with probability for tails Each of the players tosses one time and the players ip ping tails must drop out If all get heads the trial is is qua lied and must be repeated completely with all players as many times as necessary until some players do quit If at least one player remains after the rst round the second round continues with the remaining players who must toss another coin with probability for tails The game lasts with probabilities for tails until all players are sorted out It is assumed that the probabilities are independent random variables with given distribution on and that given Xj the individual outcomes at round are conditionally independent It follows readily that as far as only the number of players is concerned the outcome of round depends on the past solely through the number of players which proceed that far random composition of integer arises with part being the number of players dropping out at round In this paper we shall focus on some properties of in particular we are interested in the distribution of the number of parts of the composition which may be thought of as the duration of the game There is natural way to settle all on the same probability space in consistent fashion Consider random interval partition of by points and assign each player random uniform tag independent of the The tags group within the intervals and recording the cluster sizes from the left to the right yields composition intervals containing no tags are ignored To establish equivalence with the coin tossing construction we only need to note that the chance for particular player to remain for at least rounds in the game is precisely The game in corresponds to supported by single point in which case the are all equal The composition is induced then by sampling from geometric distribution and of course had appeared many times in the literature under die rent guises Karl in distinguished this case in the context of general occupation problem with inn it ely many boxes and derived

The Future of Nuclear Energy Facts and Fiction Chapter III How un reliable are the Red Book Uranium Resource Data Michael it mar Institute of Particle Physics ETH Zurich Switzerland October Abstract For more than years the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD countries and the International Atomic Energy Administration of the United Nations have published biannual document with the title Uranium Resources Production and Demand This book known as the Red Book summarizes data about the actual and near future nuclear energy situation and presents the accumulated worldwide knowledge about the existing and expected uranium resources These data are widely believed to provide an accurate and solid basis for future decisions about nuclear energy Unfortunately as it is demonstrated in this paper they do not The conventional worldwide uranium resources are estimated by the authors of the Red Book as million tons Out of these million tons are assigned to the reasonable assured category and million tons are associated with the not yet discovered but assumed to exist inferred resources Our analysis shows that neither the million tons of assured resources nor the million tons of inferred resources are jus tied by the Red Book data and that the actual known exploit able resources are probably much smaller Despite many shortcomings of the uranium resource data some interesting and valuable information can be extracted from the Red Book Perhaps most importantly the Red Book resource data can be used to test the economic geological hypothesis which claims for example that doubling of uranium price will increase the amount exploit able uranium resources by an even larger factor The relations between the uranium resources claimed for the die rent resource categories and their associated cost estimates are found to be in clear contradiction with this hypothesis mail Michael it mar cern ch

Renewal Processes with Costs and Rewards Maria la sio October Abstract We review the theory of renewal reward processes which describes renewal processes that have some cost or reward associated with each cycle We present new implied proof of the renewal reward theorem that mimics the proof of the elementary renewal theorem and avoids the technicalities in the proof that is presented in most textbooks Moreover we mention brie the extension of the theory to partial rewards where it is assumed that rewards are not accrued only at renewal epochs but also during the renewal cycle For this case we present counterexample which indicates that the standard conditions for the renewal reward theorem are not uci ent additional regularity assumptions are necessary We present few examples to indicate the usefulness of this theory where we prove the inspection paradox and Little law through the renewal reward theorem Basic notions and results Many applications of the renewal theory involve rewards or costs which can be simply seen as negative reward For example consider the classical example of renewal process machine component gets replaced upon failure or upon having operated for time units Then the time the th component is in service is given by Yn min Xn where Xn is the life of the component In this example one might be interested in the rate of the number of replacements in the long run An extension of this basic setup is as follows component that has failed will be replaced at cost while component that is replaced while still being operational and thus at time costs only In this case one might be interested in choosing the optimal time that minimise the long run operational costs The solution to this problem involves the analysis of renewal processes with costs and rewards Motivated by the above let cid be renewal process with inter arrival times Xn cid and denote the time of the th renewal by Now suppose that at the time of each renewal reward is received we denote by Rn the reward received at the end of the th cycle We further assume that is sequence of random variables which allows for to depend on For example might count the number of rides taxi gets up to time In this case is the length of each trip and one reasonably expects the fare to depend on As usual we denote by the generic bi variate random variable that are distributed identically to the sequence of rewards and inter arrival times In the analysis together with the standard assumption in renewal processes that the inter arrival times have nite expectation we will further assume that The cumulative reward up to time is given by cid where the su mistaken to be equal to zero in the event that Depending Dept of Mathematics Computer Science Eindhoven University of Technology Box MB Eindhoven The Netherlands la sio tue nl

Limit theorems for random walks on Fuchsia buildings and Kac Moody groups Gil ch Muller Parkinson September Abstract In this paper we prove rate of escape theorem and central limit theorem for isotropic random walks on Fuchsia buildings giving formulae for the speed and asymptotic var ance In particular these results apply to random walks induced by bi invariant measures on Fuchsia Kac Moody groups however they also apply to the case where the building is not associated to any reasonable group structure Our primary strategy is to construct renewal structure of the random walk For this purpose we de ne cones and cone types for buildings and prove that the corresponding automata in the building and the underlying Coxeter group are strongly connected The limit theorems are then proven by adapting the techniques in The moments of the renewal times are controlled via the retraction of the walks on to an apartment of the building Keywords random walk limit theorems Fuchsia building Kac Moody group Cannon automaton Mathematics Subject Classification
Multidimensional Random Polymers Renewal Approach Dmitry of fe Abstract In these lecture notes which are based on the mini course given at Prague School on Mathematical Statistical Physics we discuss ballistic phase of quenched and annealed stretched polymers in random environment on Zd with an emphasis on the natural re normalized renewal structures which appear in such mod els In the ballistic regime an irreducible decomposition of typical polymers leads to an effective random walk reinterpretation of the latter In the annealed case the Or nste in er nike theory based on this approach paves the way to an essentially complete control on the level of local limit results and in variance principles In the quenched case the renewal structure maps the model of stretched polymers into an effective model of directed polymers As result one is able to use techniques and ideas developed in the context of directed polymers in order to address issues like strong disorder in low dimensions and weak disorder in higher dimensions Among the topics addressed Thermodynamics of quenched and annealed models multi dimensional renewal theory under Cramer condition re normalization and ef fec ti ve random walk structure of annealed polymers very weak disorder in dimensions and strong disorder in dimensions
Estimation of Joint Distribution of Demand and Available Renewables for Generation Adequacy Assessment Zachary and Dent December Abstract In recent years there has been resurgence of interest in generation adequacy risk assessment due to the need to include variable generation renewables within such calculations This paper will describe new statistical approaches to estimating the joint distribution of demand and available VG capacity this is required for the LOL calculations used in many statutory adequacy studies for example those of GB and PJM The most popular estimation technique in the VG integration literature is hind cast in which the historic joint distribution of demand and available VG is used as predictive distribution Through the use of bootstrap statistical analysis this paper will show that due to extreme sparsity of data on times of high demand and low VG hind cast results can sue from sampling uncertainty to the extent that they have little practical meaning An alternative estimation approach in which marginal distribution of available VG is re scaled according to demand level is thus proposed This reduces sampling uncertainty at the expense of the additional model structure assumption and further provides means of assessing the sensitivity of model out puts to the VG demand relationship by varying the function of demand by which the marginal VG distribution is re scaled Keywords power system planning power system reliability risk analysis wind power

ALGORITHMS FOR NON LINEAR AND STOCHASTIC RESOURCE CONSTRAINED SHORTEST PATH AXEL PAR MEN TIER Abstract Resource constrained shortest path problems are usually solved thanks to smart enumeration of all the non dominated paths Recent improvements of these enumeration algorithms rely on the use of bounds on path resources to discard partial solutions The quality of the bounds determines the performance of the algorithm The main contribution of this paper is to introduce standard procedure to generate bounds on paths resources in general setting which covers most resource constrained shortest path problems among which stochastic versions In that purpose we introduce generalization of the resource constrained shortest path pro lem where the resources are taken in mono id The resource of path is the mono id sum of the resources of its arcs The problem consists in ding path whose resource minimizes non decreasing cost function of the path resource among the paths that respect given constraint Enumeration algorithms are generalized to this framework We use lattice theory to provide poly no mi al procedures to nd good quality bounds These procedures solve generalization of the algebraic path problem where arc resources belong to lattice ordered mono id The practical ec ien cy of the approach is proved through an extensive numerical study on some deterministic and stochastic resource constrained shortest path problems

The lima to logical relationships between wind and solar energy supply in Britain Philip Be tt Hazel Thornton Me tO ce Hadley Centre FitzRoy Road Exeter EX PB United Kingdom Abstract We use reanalysis data to investigate the daily co variability of wind and solar ir radiance in Britain and its implications for renewable energy supply balancing The joint distribution of daily mean windspeeds and ir radiance shows that ir radiance has much stronger seasonal cycle than wind due to the rotational tilt of the Earth Ir radiance is weakly anti correlated with wind speed throughout the year cid cid there is weak tendency for windy days to be cloudier This is particularly true in Atlantic facing regions western Scotland south west England The east coast of Britain has the weakest anti correlation particularly in winter primarily associated with relative increase in the frequency of clear but windy days We also consider the variability in total power output from onshore wind turbines and solar photovoltaic panels In all months daily variability in total power is always reduced by incorporating solar capacity The scenario with the least seasonal variability is approximately solar to wind This work emphasises the importance of considering the full distribution of daily behaviour rather than relying on long term average relationships or correlations In particular the anti correlation between wind and solar power in Britain cannot solely be relied upon to produce well balanced energy supply cid Crown Copyright Me tO ce Keywords wind power generation solar PV power generation climatology energy balancing reanalysis seasonal variability

Pragmatic Approach to Sovereignty on Mars Sara Bru hn and Jacob Haq Misr Blue Marble Space Institute of Science th Ave Suite Seattle Washington United States Email jacob bms is org Published in Space Policy doi space pol Abstract Rising interest in Mars colonization from both private and public sectors necessitates renewed discussion about sovereignty in space The non appropriation principle of the Outer Space Treaty currently prohibits any sovereign claims to celestial bodies but it remains unclear how this principle should be applied to the peaceful colonization of Mars Here we develop pragmatic approach to guide the settlement of Mars which is based upon bounded first possession model with mandatory planetary parks Scientists experts and leaders will establish planetary park locations and regulations through worldwide community solicitation in order to protect sites of scientific aesthetic historical cultural environmental spiritual value Colonization parties may occupy limited plots of martian land and may claim exclusive economic rights within this zone while still refraining from any claims to sovereignty All colonists remain under the legal jurisdiction of their host nation with conflicts to be resolved diplomatically or through temporary tribunal system composed of representatives from other Mars colonies We also propose the formation of Mars Secretariat as an administrative body with limited power to facilitate communication among parties Our model for Mars colonization remains consistent with the Outer Space Treaty but we also recommend revisiting or amending the non appropriation and province of mankind principles to resolve the ambiguity of how nations corporations and individuals may utilize the resources of space

Robust Control Framework for Time Varying Power Sharing among Distributed Energy Resources May ank Baran wal and Srinivasa Sala paka Abstract One of the most important challenges facing an electric grid is to incorporate renewables and distributed energy resources DER to the grid Because of the associated uncertainties in power generations and peak power demands opportunities for improving the functioning and reliability of the grid lie in the design of an efc ent yet pragmatic distributed control framework with guaranteed robustness margins This paper addresses the problem of output voltage regulation for multiple DC DC converters connected to grid and prescribes robust scheme for sharing power among different sources More precisely we develop control arch tec ture where unlike most standard control frameworks the desired power ratios appear as reference signals to individual converter systems and not as internal parameters of the system of parallel converters This makes the proposed approach suited Fig schematic of micro grid An array of DC sources provide for scenarios when the desired power ratios vary rapidly with power for AC loads Power sources provide power at DC link time Additionally the proposed control framework is suitable to both centralized and decentralized implementations their common output bus at voltage that is regulated to set the same control architecture can be employed for voltage point The control system at the respective DC DC converter that regulation irrespective of the availability of common load interfaces with source is responsible for regulating the voltage at current or power measurement without the need to modify he DC link An inverter that connects to the DC link converts the controller parameters The control design is obtained using total current from the sources at the regulated voltage to alternating robust optimal control framework Case studies presented show the enhanced performance of prescribed optimal controllers for current AC at its output to satisfy the power demands of the AC voltage regulation and power sharing loads This paper describes an approach for control design of the multiple converters systems associated with power transfer from

Non renewal statistics for electron transport in molecular junction with electron vibration interaction Daniel Kos ov College of Science and Engineering James Cook University Townsville QLD Australia Quantum transport of electrons through molecule is series of individual electron tunneling events separated by stochastic waiting time intervals We study the emergence of temporal corre la ions between successive waiting times for the electron transport in vibrating molecular junction Using master equation approach we compute joint probability distribution for waiting times of two successive tunneling events We show that the probability distribution is completely reset after each tunneling event if molecular vibrations are thermally qui lib rated If we treat vibrational dy nam ics exactly without imposing the qui lib ration constraint the statistics of electron tunneling events become non renewal Non renewal statistics between two waiting times and means that the density matrix of the molecule is not fully renewed after time and the probability of observing waiting time for the second electron transfer depends on the previous electron waiting time The strong electron vibration coupling is required for the emergence of the non renewal statistics We show that in Franck Condon blockade regime the extremely rare tunneling events become positively correlated

Quantifying resource in catalytic resource theory Anura An shu Min Hsi Hsieh Rah ul Jain August Abstract We consider general resource theory that allows the use of free resource as catalyst We show that the amount of resource contained in given state in the asymptotic scenario is equal to the regularized relative entropy of resource of that state which then yields straight forward operational meaning to this quantity Such an answer has been long sought for in any resource theory since the usefulness of state in information processing tasks is directly related to the amount of resource the state possesses in the beginning While we need to place few assumptions in our resource theoretical framework it is still general enough and includes quantum resource theory of entanglement coherence asymmetry non uniformity purity con textual it stabilizer computation and the classical resource theory of randomness extraction as special cases Since our resource theoretic framework includes entanglement theory our result also implies that the amount of noise one has to inject locally in order to erase all entanglement contained in an entangled state is equal to the regularized relative entropy of entanglement resolving an open question posted in Gro is man et al Ph ys Rev On the way to prove the main result we also quantify the amount of resource contained in state in the one shot setting where one only has single copy of the state in terms of the smooth max relative entropy Our one shot result employs recently developed technique of convex split lemma

Renewal Model of Intrusion David To lp in dvd off topi net Abstract We present probabilistic model of an intrusion in renewal process Given process and sequence of events an intrusion is sub sequence of events that is not produced by the process Applications of the model are for example online payment fraud with the fraud ster taking over users account and performing payments on the users behalf or unexpected equipment failures due to unintended use We adopt Bayesian approach to infer the probability of an intrusion in se que ce of events aMAP sub sequence of events constituting the intrusion and the marginal probability of each event in sequence to belong to the intrusion We evaluate the model for intrusion detection on synthetic data and on an ony miz ed data from an online payment system Overview We approach the problem of distinguishing between native events and intrusions in an event stream arriving overtime This problem arises in multiple applications Consider for example an online payment service where the users connect with their credentials and pay for goods or services thief can illegally obtain access to another users account and steal money by sending payments on behalf of the legitimate user Is there away to identify illegal payments by looking at sequence of payments even if each individual payment looks legitimate We turn to the renewal process as the basis for the probabilistic generative model of the problem Renewal processes are used to model arrival of events where hold times between events are independently distributed We assume that regular events come from renewal process with known parameters which can be given or inferred We then consider sequence of recent events and reason about the likelihood that some of the events are foreign rather than belong to the process We adopt the Bayesian approach to infer the probability of an intrusion in given event sequence maximum posterior probability MAP sub sequence of events constituting the intrusion and the marginal probability of each event to belong to the intrusion We show that the inference can be performed in polynomial time We implement the inference algorithms and evaluate the inference on synthetic data and on an ony miz ed data from an online payment system Contributions The paper brings the following contributions probabilistic generative model for inference about intrusions in renewal processes Polynomial time algorithms for computing the probability of an intrusion MAP subs que ce of events constituting the intrusion and the marginal probability of each event to belong to the intrusion An evaluation of applicability of the algorithms to intrusion detection in online payment systems Pre print Work in progress

Renewal in Hawkes processes with self excitation and inhibition Manon Costa Carl Graham Laurence Mar salle Viet Chi Tr an March Abstract This paper investigates Hawkes processes on the positive real line exhibiting both self excitation and inhibition Each point of this point process impacts its future intensity by the addition of signed reproduction function The case of an on negative reproduction function corresponds to self excitation and has been widely investigated in the literature In particular there exists cluster representation of the Hawkes process which allows to apply results known for Galton Watson trees In the present at paper using renewal techniques we establish limit theorems for Hawkes processes that have reproduction functions which are signed and have bounded support We notably prove exponential concentration inequalities and thus extend results of Reyna ud Bou ret and Roy which were proved for non negative reproduction functions using this cluster representation which is no longer valid in our case An important step for this is to establish the existence of exponential moments for renewal times of queues that appear naturally in our problem These results have their own interest independently of the original problem for the Hawkes processes MSC subject classic ation Key words Point processes self excitation inhibition renewal theory ergo dic limit the rem concentration inequalities Galton Watson trees queues Acknowledgments The authors thank Patricia Reyna ud Bou ret for introducing them to Hawkes processes and for proposing the problem of inhibition in Hawkes processes All the authors have been supported by the Chair Model is ation Ma the mati que et Bio diver site of Ve oli En vi ronne ment Ecole Polytechnique Museum National Histoire Naturelle Fondation and acknowledge support from La bex CEM PI AN LAB Institut deM the mati ques de Toulouse MR Universit ede Toulouse CNRS UPS IMT Toulouse Cede France mail manon costa math un iv toulouse fr MAP CNRS Ecole polytechnique Institut Polytechnique de Paris Palais eau France carl graham polytechnique edu Un iv Lille CNRS MR Labor to ire Paul Pain le ve Lille France mail laurence mar salle math un iv lille fr Un iv Lille CNRS MR Labor to ire Paul Pain le ve Lille France mail chi tr an math un iv lille fr

Accessible bounds for general quantum resources Thomas Bromley Marco Cia nc iaru so of klis our ek as Bar to sz Re gul and Gerardo desso Centre for the Mathematics and Theoretical Physics of Quantum Non Equilibrium Systems School of Mathematical Sciences University of Nottingham Nottingham NG RD United Kingdom mail gerardo desso nottingham ac uk Abstract The recent development of general quantum resource theories has given sound basis for the quant cation of useful quantum eec ts Nevertheless the evaluation of resource measure can be highly non trivial involving an optimisation that is often intractable analytically or intensive numerically In this paper we describe general framework that provides quantitative lower bounds to any resource quan tier that satis es the essential property of monotonic it under the corresponding set of free operations Our framework relies on projecting all quantum states on to restricted subset using axed resource non increasing operation The resources of the resultant family can then be evaluated using implied optimisation with the result providing lower bounds on the resource contents of any state This approach also reduces the experimental overhead requiring only the relevant statistics of the restricted family of states We illustrate the application of our framework by focusing on the resource of multi qu bit entanglement and outline applications to other quantum resources

Class of Tests for Trend in Time Censored Recurrent Event Data Jan Ter je Kv aly Department of Mathematics and Physics University of Stavanger Norway Bo Henry Lind qv is Department of Mathematical Sciences Norwegian University of Science and Technology Norway Abstract Statistical tests for trend in recurrent event data not following Poisson process are generally constructed for event censored data However time censored data are more frequently encountered in practice In this paper we contribute tolling an important gap in the literature on trend testing by presenting class of statistical tests for trend in time censored recurrent event data based on the null hypothesis of renewal process The class of tests is constructed by an adaption of functional central limit theorem for renewal processes By this approach number of tests for time censored recurrent event data can be constructed including among others version of the classical Lewis Robinson trend test and an Anderson Darling type test The latter test turns out to have attractive properties for general use by having good power properties against both monotonic and non monotonic trends Extensions to situations with several processes are considered Properties of the tests are studied by simulations and the approach is illustrated in two data examples Keywords Trend testing Time truncation Renewal process Trend renewal process Brownian bridge

Capacity Price Game for Uncertain Renewables Resources Pan Li Shreyas Sekar Member IEEE and Bao sen Zhang Member IEEE this Abstract Renewable resources are starting to constitute growing portion of the total generation mix of the power system key difference between renewables and traditional generators is that many renewable resources are managed by individuals especially in the distribution system In this paper we study the capacity investment and pricing problem where multiple renewable producers compete in decentralized market It is known that most deterministic capacity games tend to result in very in efc ien te qui libri even when there area large number of similar players In contrast we show that due to the inherent randomness of renewable resources the qui libri in our capacity game becomes efc ent as the number of players grows and coincides with the centralized decision from the social planners problem This result provides new perspective on how to look at the positive in en ce of randomness in game framework as well as its contribution to resource planning scheduling and bidding We validate our results by simulation studies using real world data Index Terms Capacity game Nash equilibrium renewables generation cid

Dynamic Resource Allocation in the Cloud with Near Optimal Ec ien cy Sebastian Perez Salazar Is hai Men ache Moh it Singh Alejandro Tori ello January Abstract Cloud computing has motivated renewed interest in resource allocation problems with new consumption models common goal is to share resource such as CPU or bandwidth among distinct users with die rent demand patterns as well as die rent quality of service re quire ment To ensure these service requirements cloud oe rings often come with service level agreement SLA between the provider and the users An SLA species the amount of are source user is entitled to utilize In many cloud settings providers would like to operate resources at high utilization while simultaneously respecting individual LAs There is typically trade between these two objectives for example utilization can be increased by shifting away resources from idle users to scavenger workload but with the risk of the former then becoming active again We study this fundamental trade by formulating resource allocation model that captures basic properties of cloud computing systems including LAs highly limited feedback about the state of the system and variable and unpredictable input sequences Our main result is simple and practical algorithm that achieves near optimal performance on the above two objectives First we guarantee nearly optimal utilization of the resource even if compared to the omniscient in dynamic optimum Second we simultaneously satisfy all individual LAs up to small error The main algorithmic tool is multiplicative weight update algorithm and primal dual argument to obtain its guarantees We also provide numerical validation on real data to demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in practical applications Key words Cloud Computing Online Algorithms

Moderate deviation analysis of major is ation based resource inter conversion Christopher Chubb Marco Toma michel and Kamil Kor ze kwa Centre for Engineered Quantum Systems School of Physics University of Sydney Sydney NSW Australia Centre for Quantum Software and Information School of Software University of Technology Sydney Sydney NSW Australia We consider the problem of inter converting nite amount of resources within all theories whose single shot transformation rules are based on major is ation relation the resource theories of entanglement and coherence for pure state transformations as well as thermodynamics for energy incoherent transformations When only nite resources are available we expect to see non trivial trade between the rate rn at which copies of are source state can be transformed into rn copies of another resource state and the error level of the inter conversion process as function of In this work we derive the optimal trade in the so called moderate deviation regime where the rate of inter conversion rn approaches its optimum in the asymptotic limit of unbounded resources while the error vanishes in the same limit We nd that the moderate deviation analysis exhibits resonance behaviour which implies that certain pairs of resource states can be inter converted at the asymptotically optimal rate with negligible error even in the nite regime
