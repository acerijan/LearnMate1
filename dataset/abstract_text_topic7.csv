Collective navigation of complex networks Participatory greedy routing Kaj Kol Kleine berg and Dirk Hel bing Computational Social Science ETH Zurich Clausius stra sse CH Zurich Switzerland Dated October Many networks are used to transfer information or goods in other words they are navigated The larger the network the more di cult it is to navigate cie ntl Indeed information routing in the Internet faces serious cal ability problems due to its rapid growth recently accelerated by the rise of the Internet of Things Large networks like the Internet can be navigated cie ntl if nodes or agents actively forward information based on hidden maps underlying these systems However in reality most agents will deny to forward messages which has cost and navigation is impossible Can we design appropriate incentives that lead to participation and global navigability Here we present an evolutionary game where agents share the value generated by successful delivery of information or goods We show that global navigability can emerge but its complete breakdown is possible as well Furthermore we show that the system tends to self organize into local clusters of agents who participate in the navigation This organizational principle can be exploited to favor the emergence of global navigability in the system Keywords Complex networks navigation incentives participatory greedy routing

Sensing as Service aS Buying and Selling oT Data Chari th Per era The Internet of Things oT envisions the creation of an environment where everyday objects microwaves fridges cars coffee machines etc are connected to the internet and make users lives more convenient It will also lead users to consume resources more efficiently Read More Over the past few years large number of oT solutions have come to the oT marketplace Typically each solution consisting of one or more Internet Connected Objects ICO is designed to perform single or minimal number of tasks primary usage For example smart sprinkler may only be activated if the soil moisture falls below certain level in garden Further smart plugs allow users to control electronic appliances including legacy appliances remotely or create automated schedules Such automation not only brings convenience to users but also reduces resource wastage through efficient planning and predictions The data collected by each of these solutions are used by them and stored in access controlled silos After the primary usage data are either thrown away or locked down in independent data silos There is significant amount of knowledge hidden in these silos that can be used to improve our lives including behaviours habits and life patterns and reduce wastage through efficient resource consumption To discover such knowledge it is essential to analyse data stuck in independent silos together on large scale There are three main barriers to achieving this Data owners do not have much control over their data and their data are locked in silos managed by products and services companies Data owners only have access to their own data which has little value when it comes to knowledge discovery Data owners do not know how to discover knowledge from raw data To overcome these barriers we propose Sensing as Service aS model It is vision and business model that promotes data exchange trading between data owners and data consumers Imagine world where data owners who own oT solutions get rewarded money loyalty points gifts vouchers bitcoin actionable advice etc for sharing trading their personal data collected by oT products From the other end companies data consumers get to understand their customers data owners better As result companies will be able to optimize their business operations by saving costs and create new products and services to fit individual customer needs Data consumers may recover their data acquisition costs through business process optimization and increased customer data owners satisfaction Data consumers can be government or not for profits as well

Decoupled IF TTT Constraining Privilege in Trigger Action Platforms for the Internet of Things Earl en ce Fernandes Amir Rahmat Jae yeon Jung Atul Prakash University of Michigan Samsung University of Michigan Abstract Trigger Action platforms are an emerging class of have started adding automation support for physical devices web based systems that enable users to create automation rules making it possible for users to set up rules like If there is or recipes of the form If there is smoke alarm then turn smoke alarm then turn off my oven These platforms off my oven These platforms stitch together various online have privileged access to users online services and physical services including Internet of Things devices social networks devices If they are compromised then attackers can arbitrarily and productivity tools by obtaining OAuth tokens on behalf of manipulate data and devices belonging to large number of users Unfortunately these platforms also introduce long term users to cause damage security risk If they are compromised the attacker can misuse ul the OAuth tokens belonging to millions of users to arbitrarily We quantify the risk users face if trigger action platform manipulate their devices and data In this work we rst quantify is compromised by performing the rst empirical analysis of the risk users face in the context of If This Then That IF TTT IF TTT authorization model cloud based closed source popular trigger action platform that interfaces with online system that provides trigger action abstraction for end services and provides over recipes We perform the rst users in the form of recipes Running our example recipe empirical analysis of the OAuth based authorization model of IF TTT using semi automated tools that we built to overcome the above requires IF TTT to integrate with the smoke alarm challenges of IF TTT closed source nature and of online service Nest and the oven and obtain authorization to access them API inconsistencies We nd that of IF TTT channels an on the users behalf It achieves this integration using its abstraction of online services use over privileged OAuth tokens channel abstraction through which IF TTT gains privileged increasing risks in the event of compromise Even if the OAuth access to the users accounts on online services that in turn tokens were to be privileged correctly IF TTT compromise will provide access to the smoke alarm and the oven IF TTT and not prevent their misuse Motivated by this empirical analysis online services decide the privilege using the popular OAuth we design build and evaluate Decoupled IF TTT IF TTT the protocol where IF TTT requests certain amount rst trigger action platform where users do not have to give it of privilege using the scope parameter and gains OAuth highly privileged access to their online services IF TTT splits the logically monolithic IF TTT architecture into cloud service tokens if users grant privilege Therefore IF TTT contains that users do not trust and set of clients user only has OAuth tokens for all user online services in its logically to trust the client she installs Our design pushes the notion of monolithic architecture If IF TTT is compromised then the ne grained OAuth tokens to its extreme and ensures that even attacker can misuse the tokens and arbitrarily manipulate data if the cloud service is controlled by the attacker it cannot misuse and devices Furthermore incorrect OAuth scoping can lead the OAuth tokens to invoke unauthorized actions Using such to over privilege either IF TTT channels may request broad ne grained tokens would normally lead to drastic increase in scopes or the online services may only offer coarse grained the number of OAuth permission prompts IF TTT avoids this scopes In either case if IF TTT is compromised the highly increase by introducing the concept of Transfer Token Token privileged OAuth tokens will only increase the damage that and combining it with recipe spec ic tokens Our evaluation attackers can cause establishes that IF TTT poses modest overhead it adds less than ms of latency to recipe execution time and reduces throughput We choose to study IF TTT for several reasons First it is by popular platform supporting channels as of April th and offers more than recipes many created

DEMONSTRABLY DOING ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE INTERNET OF THINGS Lachlan Ur qu hart Tom Lodge and Andy Crab tree School of Computer Science University of Nottingham UK Corresponding author lachlan ur qu hart nottingham ac uk ABSTRACT This paper explores the importance of accountability to data protection and how it can be built into the Internet of Things oT The need to build accountability into the oT is motivated by the opaque nature of distributed data flows inadequate consent mechanisms and lack of interfaces enabling end user control over the behaviours of internet enabled devices The lack of accountability precludes meaningful engagement by end users with their personal data and poses key challenge to creating user trust in the oT and the reciprocal development of the digital economy The EU General Data Protection Regulation GDP seeks to remedy this particular problem by mandating that rapidly developing technological ecosystem be made accountable In doing so it foregrounds new responsibilities for data controllers including data protection by design and default and new data subject rights such as the right to data portability While GDP is technologically neutral it is nevertheless anticipated that realising the vision will turn upon effective technological development Accordingly this paper examines the notion of accountability how it has been translated into systems design recommendations for the oT and how the oT Data box puts key data protection principles into practice

Decentralizing Privacy Enforcement for Internet of Things Smart Objects Go khanS girl ar Barbara Carmina ti and Elena Ferrari DIST University of In sub ria Italy Abstract Internet of Things oT is now evolving into loosely coupled decentralized system of cooperating smart objects where high speed data processing analytics and shorter response times are becoming more necessary than ever Such decentralization has great impact on the way personal information generated and consumed by smart objects should be protected because without centralized data management it is more di cult to control how data are combined and used by smart objects To cope with this issue in this paper we propose framework where users of smart objects can specify their privacy preferences Compliance check of user individual privacy preferences is performed directly by smart objects Moreover acknowledging that embedding the enforcement mechanism into smart objects implies some overhead we have extensively tested the proposed framework on die rent scenarios and the obtained results show the feasibility of our approach Keywords Internet of Things oT Smart Objects Privacy
