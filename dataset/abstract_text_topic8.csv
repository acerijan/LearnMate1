Ec ent Batch Update of Unique den tiers in Distributed Hash Table for Resources in Mobile Host Yoo Chung November Abstract Resources in distributed system can be den tied using den tiers based on random numbers When using distributed hash table to resolve such den tiers to network locations the straightforward approach is to store the network location directly in the hash table entry associated with an den tier When mobile host contains large number of resources this requires that all of the associated hash table entries must be updated when its network address changes We propose an alternative approach where we store host den tier in the entry associated with resource den tier and the actual network address of the host in separate host entry This can drastically reduce the time required for updating the distributed hash table when mobile host changes its network address We also investigate under which ir cum stances our approach should or should not be used We evaluate and con rm the usefulness of our approach with experiments run on top of OpenD HT

On Leveraging Partial Paths in Partially Connected Networks Technical Report TR Simon Heim li cher Mer our is Kara lio poul os Han och Levy and Thr as vo los Spyro poul os Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory ETH Zurich Switzerland Abstract Mobile wireless network research focuses on scenarios at the extremes of the network connectivity continuum where the probability of all nodes being connected is either close to unity assuming connected paths be tween all nodes mobile ad hoc networks or it is close to zero assuming no multi hop paths exist at all delay tolerant networks In this paper we argue that sizable fraction of networks lies between these extremes and is characterized by the existence of partial paths multi hop path segments that allow forwarding data closer to the destination even when no end to end path is available fundamental issue in such networks is dealing with disruptions of end to end paths Under stochastic model we compare the performance of the established end to end retransmission ignoring partial paths against forwarding mechanism that leverages partial paths to forward data closer to the destination even during is rup tion periods Perhaps surprisingly the alternative mechanism is not necessarily superior However under stochastic monotonic it condition between current vs future path length which we demonstrate to hold in typical network models we manage to prove superiority of the alter native mechanism in stochastic dominance terms We believe that this study could serve as foundation to design more ec ent data transfer protocols for partially connected networks which could potentially help reducing the gap between applications that can be supported over disc on nec ted networks and those requiring full connectivity

Defect model for the mixed mobile ion effect revisited an importance of deformation rates Vladimir Be lost ot sky Curtis Place Rockville MD Email vlad bel ero ls com ABSTRACT The progress in understanding the behavior of glassy mixed ionic conductors within the concept of the defect model for the mixed mobile ion effect Be lost ot sky Non Cry st Solids is reported It is shown that in mixed ionic conductor mixed alkali glass containing two or more types of dissimilar mobile ions of unequal size sufficient local strain arising from the size mismatch of mobile ion entering foreign site can not be in principle absorbed by the surrounding network forming matrix without its damage Primary site rearrangement occurs immediately on the time scale close to that of the ion migration process through the formation of intrinsic defects in the nearest glass network Neither an elastic relaxation below glass transition temperature nor vis co elastic or viscous behavior at or above can be expected being observed in this case because the character of the stress relaxation in wide temperature range is dictated above all by the deformation rates employed locally to the adjacent network forming matrix Since the ion migration occurs on the picosecond time scale the primary rearrangement of the glass network adjacent to an ionic site occurs at rates orders of magnitude higher than those of the critical minimum values so the matrix demonstrates brittle elastic response to the arising strain even at temperatures well above which explains among other things why mixed alkali effect is observable in glass melts PAC Fs Ji Hs Keywords mixed mobile ion effect mixed alkali effect intrinsic defects glass transition temperature ionic conductivity critical deformation rate

Physical Model of Wireless Network Jean Marc Kel if Orange Labs Issy Les Moulin eaux France jean marc kel if orange ft group com Abstract Using an approach developed in physics we propose new framework for the study of cellular networks The key idea of the physical network model we propose is to replace the discrete base stations BS entities by continuum of transmitters which are spatially distributed in the network This allows us to establish closed form formula of the other cell down link interference factor as function of the location of the mobile We de ne here as the ratio of outer cell received power the power received from other cells to the inner cell received power This physical model allows calculating the in en ce of interference on any mobile in cell whatever its position Results obtained with that closed form formula are close to the ones obtained by simulations using traditional hexagonal network model Since the physical model allows to establish closed form formula of the interference factor it allows to do analytical studies of wireless networks such as outage probability quality of service capacity

Secure Wireless Routing Protocol Using Enhanced Chain Signatures Amita bh xena International University Bruch sal Germany Abstract We propose routing protocol for wireless networks Wireless routing protocols allow hosts within network to have some knowledge of the topology in order to know when to forward packet via broadcast and when to drop it Since routing protocol forms the backbone of network it is lucrative target for many attacks all of which attempt to disrupt network tra by corrupting routing tables of neighboring routers using false updates Secure routing protocols designed for wired networks such as BGP are not scalable in an ad hoc wireless environment because of two main drawbacks the need to maintain knowledge about all immediate neighbors which requires discovery protocol and the need to transmit the same update several times one for each neighbor Although information about neighbors is readily available in fairly static and wired network such information is often not updated or available in an ad hoc wireless network with mobile devices Our protocol is variant of BGP called BGP and allows single broadcast for routing updates without having the need to be aware of every neighboring router The protocol is based on novel authentication primitive called Enhanced Chain Signatures EC

Interference in Lattice Networks Martin Hae ngg Abstract Lattices are important as models for the node locations in wireless networks for two main reasons When network designers have control over the placement of the nodes they often prefer regular arrangement in lattice for coverage and interference reasons If nodes are randomly distributed or mobile good channel access schemes ensure that concurrent transmitters are regularly spaced hence the locations of the transmitting nodes are well approximated by lattice In this paper we introduce general interference bounding techniques that permit the derivation of tight closed form upper and lower bounds for all lattice networks and we present and analyze optimum or near optimum channel access schemes for one dimensional square and triangular lattices Index Terms Wireless networks interference time division multiple access geometry

Exploring Human Mobility Patterns Based on Location Information of US Flights Bin Jiang and Tao Jia Department of Technology and Built Environment Division of Geo ma tics University of le SE le Sweden Email bin jiang hig se jia tao com Draft April Revision August Abstract range of early studies have been conducted to illustrate human mobility patterns using different tracking data such as dollar notes cell phones and taxicabs Here we explore human mobility patterns based on massive tracking data of US flights Both topological and geometric properties are examined in detail We found that topological properties such as traffic volume between airports and degree of connectivity of individual airports including both in and out degrees follow power law distribution but not geometric property like travel lengths The travel lengths exhibit an exponential distribution rather than power law with an exponential cutoff as previous studies illustrated We further simulated human mobility on the established topologies of airports with various moving behaviors and found that the mobility patterns are mainly attributed to the underlying binary topology of airports and have little to do with other factors such as moving behaviors and geometric distances Apart from the above findings this study adopts the head tail division rule which is regularity behind any heavy tailed distribution for extracting individual airports The adoption of this rule for data processing constitutes another major contribution of this paper Keywords scaling of geographic space head tail division rule power law geographic information agent based simulations

Consensus vs Broadcast in Communication Networks with Arbitrary Mobile Omission Faults Emmanuel God ard and Joseph Peters cid Pac ic Institute for Mathematical Sciences CNRS UMI School of Computing Science Simon Fraser University Abstract We compare the so lv ability of the Consensus and Broadcast problems in synchronous communication networks in which the delivery of messages is not reliable The failure model is the mobile omission faults model During each round some messages can be lost and the set of possible simultaneous losses is the same for each round We investigate these problems for the rst time for arbitrary sets of possible failures Previously these sets were de ned by bounding the numbers of failures In this setting we present new necessary condition for the so lv ability of Consensus that unies previous impossibility results in this area This condition is expressed using Broadcast ability properties As very important application we show that when the sets of omissions that can occur are de ned by bounding the numbers of failures counted in any way locally globally etc then the Consensus problem is actually equivalent to the Broadcast problem

Flooding Time in Opportunistic Networks under Power Law and Exponential Inter Contact Times Luca Bec chet ti Andrea Clementi Francesco Pasquale Giovanni Resta Paolo Santi Riccardo Silvestri cid October Abstract Performance bounds for opportunistic networks have been derived in number of recent papers for several key quantities such as the expected delivery time of uni cast message or the oo ding time measure of how fast information spreads However to the best of our knowledge none of the existing results is derived under mobility model which is able to reproduce the power law exponential tail dichotomy of the pairwise node inter contact time distribution which has been observed in traces of several real opportunistic networks The contributions of this paper are two fold rst we present simple pairwise contact model called the Home MEG model for opportunistic networks based on the observation made in previous work that pairs of nodes in the network tend to meet in very few selected locations home locations this contact model is shown to be able to faithfully reproduce the power law exponential tail dichotomy of inter contact time Second we use the Home MEG model to analyze oo ding time in opportunistic networks presenting asymptotic bounds on oo ding time that assume die rent initial conditions for the existence of opportunistic links Finally our bounds provide some analytical evidences that the speed of information spreading in opportunistic networks can be much faster than that predicted by simple geo metric mobility models

tale of many cities universal patterns in human urban mobility Anastasio No ul as Salvatore cell to Renaud Lamb io tte Massimiliano Ponti Cecilia Mas colo University of Cambridge Cambridge UK University of Namur Namur Belgium and University College London London UK Dated September The advent of geographic online social networks such as Foursquare where users voluntarily signal their current location opens the door to powerful studies on human movement In particular the ne granularity of the location data with GPS accuracy down to meters and the worldwide scale of Foursquare adoption are unprecedented In this paper we study urban mobility patterns of people in several metropolitan cities around the globe by analyzing large set of Foursquare users Surprisingly while there are variations in human movement in die rent cities our analysis shows that those are predominantly due to heterogeneous distribution of places across die rent urban environments Moreover universal law for human mobility is den tied which isolates the rank distance as key component factoring in the number of places between origin and destination rather than pure physical distance as considered in previous works Building on our dings we also show that rank based movement accurately captures real human movements in die rent cities Our results shed new light on the driving factors of urban human mobility with potential applications to urban planning location based advertisement and even social studies Since the seminal works of Ravenstein the move thus driven by the spatial distribution

we know from our daily lives Human ce pt of intervening opportunities is better at explaining movements exhibit instead high levels of regularity and broad range of mobility data tend to be hindered

societal resolution and to search for universal mobility patterns issues such as urban planning and epidemiology such to feed quantitative modelling Interestingly those works have all focused on the probabilistic nature of In classical studies two related but diverging view movements in terms of physical distance As for gravity points have emerged The rst camp argues that mobil it is directly deterred by the costs in time and energy models this viewpoint nds its roots in Physics in the theory of anomalous diu sion It tends to concentrate associated to physical distance Inspired by Newtons

Distribution of charge carrier transport properties inorganic semiconductors with Gaussian disorder Jens orr mann Manuel Ru David Voc ke Vladimir Dy akon ov and Carsten Dei bel Experimental Physics VI Julius Maximilian University of Wurzburg Wurzburg Germany Bavarian Center for Applied Energy Research ZA Bayern Wurzburg Germany Dated May The charge carrier drift mobility in disordered semiconductors is commonly graphically extracted from time of ig ht OF photo current transients yielding single transit time However the term transit time is ambi gu ou sly de ned and fails to deliver mobility in terms of statistical average Here we introduce an advanced computational procedure to evaluate OF transients which allows to extract the whole distribution of transit times and mobil ties from the photo current transient instead of single value This method extending the work of Scott et al Ph ys Rev is applicable to disordered systems with Gaussian density of states DOS and its accuracy is validated using one dimensional Monte Carlo simulations We demonstrate the superiority of this new approach by comparing it to the common geometrical analysis of hole OF tr an si ents measured on poly hex yl thi oph ene diy HT The extracted distributions provide access to very detailed and accurate analysis of the charge carrier transport For instance not only the mobility given by the mean transit time but also the mean mobility can be calculated Whereas the latter determines the macro sco pic photo current the former is relevant for an accurate determination of the energetic disorder parameter within the Gaussian disorder model DM derived by using the common geometrical method is as we show underestimated instead

Nature of segregation of reactants in diffusion controlled reactions Role of mobility in forming compact clusters Pano rgy rak is and Raoul opel man Department of Chemistry University of Michigan Ann Arbor Mi USA Ab star ct We investigate the bimolecular chemical reaction taking place in low dimensional spaces when the mobil ties of the two reacting species are not equal While the case of different reactant mobil ties has been previously reported as not affecting the scaling of the reactant densities with time but only the pre exponential factor the mechanism for this had not been explained before By using Monte Carlo simulations we show that the nature of segregation is very different when compared to the normal case of equal reactant mobil ties The clusters of the mobile species are statistically homogeneous and randomly distributed in space but the clusters of the less mobile species are much more compact and restricted in space Due to the asymmetric mobil ties the initial symmetric random density fluctuations in time turn into asymmetric density fluctuations We explain this trend by calculating the correlation functions for the positions of particles for the several different cases

Contagion dynamics in time varying meta population networks Su Yu Liu Andrea Baron chell and Nicola Per ra State Key Lab of Industrial Control Technology Institute of Cyber systems and Control Zhejiang University Hangzhou China Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio technical Systems Northeastern University Boston MA USA Dated August The meta population framework is adopted in wide array of disciplines to describe systems of well separated yet connected sub populations The subgroups patches are often represented as nodes in network whose links represent the migration routes among them The connections has been so far mostly considered as static but in general evolve in time Here we address this case by investigating simple contagion processes on time varying meta

profound dieren ces from the case of static networks The threshold is entirely described by the dynamical parameters de ning the average number of instantaneously migrating individuals and does not depend on the properties of the static network representation Remarkably the diu sion and contagion processes are slower in time varying graphs than in their aggregated static counterparts the

The Strength of Arcs and Edges in Interaction Networks Elements of Model Based Approach Mauricio Sad in le Carnegie Mellon University June Abstract When analyzing interaction networks it is common to interpret the amount of interaction between two nodes as the strength of their relationship We argue that this interpretation may not be appropriate since the interaction between pair of nodes could potentially be explained only by characteristics of the nodes that compose the pair and however not by pair spec ic features In interaction networks where edges or arcs are count valued the above scenario corresponds to model of independence for the expected interaction in the network and consequently we propose the notions of arc strength and edge strength to be understood as departures from this model of in de pen den ce We discuss how our notion of arc edge strength can be used as guidance to study network structure and in particular we develop stochastic block model for directed interaction networks where arc strength is taken as latent variable We illustrate our approach by studying the interaction between the Kolkata users of the my Gamma mobile social network Key words and phrases Attractiveness Bootstrap EM algorithm Gregariousness Social network Social st ruc ture Stochastic block model Gran ove tter tie strength Valued graph

En tropic measures of individual mobility patterns Riccardo Gallo tt Armando Baz zan Mirko Degli Es post and Sandro Ram bald Department of Physics University of Bologna and IN FN Se zi one di Bologna Department of Mathematics University of Bologna mail rg allot ti gmail com Abstract Understanding human mobility from microscopic point of view may represent fundamental breakthrough for the development of statistical physics for cognitive systems and it can shed light on the applicability of macroscopic statistical laws for social systems Even if the complexity of individual behaviors prevents true microscopic approach the introduction of mes osco pic models allows the study of the dynamical properties for the non stationary states of the considered system We propose to compute various entropy measures of the individual mobility patterns obtained from GPS data that record the movements of private vehicles in the Florence district in order to point out new features of human mobility related to the use of time and space and to de ne the dynamical properties of stochastic model that could generate similar patterns Moreover we can relate the predictability properties of human mobility to the distribution of time passed between two successive trips Our analysis suggests the existence of hierarchical structure in the mobility patterns which divides the performed activities into three die rent categories according to the time cost with die rent information contents We show that Markov process de ned by using the individual mobility network is notable to reproduce this hierarchy which seems the consequence of die rent strategies in the activity choice Our results could contribute to the development of governance policies for sustainable mobility in modern cities

Unraveling the origin of exponential law in intra urban human mobility Xiao Liang Ji chang Zhao Li Dong and Ke Xu State Key Lab of Software Development Environment Bei hang University Beijing China The vast majority of travel takes place within cities Recently new data has become available which allows for the discovery of urban mobility patterns which die from established results about long

the origin of the exponential law we propose new model which can predict individual ow in urban areas better Based on the model we explain the exponential law of intra urban mobility as result of the exponential decrease in average population density in urban areas Indeed both empirical and analytical results indicate that the trip length and the population density share the same exponential

Controlling Contagion Processes in Time Varying Networks Su yu Liu Nicola Per ra Marton Kars and Alessandro Ves pig nani State Key Lab of Industrial Control Technology Institute of Cyber systems and Control Zhejiang University Hangzhou China Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio technical Systems Northeastern University Boston MA USA Institute for Sci en tic Interchange Foundation Turin Italy Dated September The vast majority of strategies aimed at controlling contagion processes on networks considers the connectivity pattern of the system as either quenched or annealed However in the real world many networks are highly dynamical and evolve in time concurrently to the contagion process Here we derive an analytical framework for the study of control strategies spec ic ally devised for time varying networks We consider the removal immunization of individual nodes according the their activity in the network and develop block variable mean el approach that allows the derivation of the equations describing the evolution of the contagion process concurrently to the network dynamic We derive the critical immunization threshold and assess the effectiveness of the control strategies Finally we validate the theoretical picture by simulating numerically the information spreading pro ces and control strategies in both synthetic networks and large scale real world mobile telephone call data set The spreading of infectious diseases malware sci en tic ideas memes are just few example of real world phe nomen that can be modeled as contagion processes on networks It has long been acknowledged that network structures and connectivity patterns are relevant factor in determining the properties of spreading processes number of strategies aimed at controlling them have been proposed with the aim of improving on the random re oval strategies that originally de ned the concept of herd immunity Those strategies target nodes according the number of connections degree the core or the betweenness of nodes just to mention few examples The efc ien cy of each strategy is then measured by its effect on the contagion process when fraction of nodes is re moved from the system More precisely the smaller is the fraction of nodes removed in order to halt the contagion process and the more effective is the strategy Although most real world networks show high level of dynamic activity the large majority of theoretical results concerning the control of contagion processes have been obtained by using complete timescale separation between the contagion process and the change in networks structure In these approaches the dynamical process takes place in either static cid or annealed cid networks However when the two time scales are comparable these convenient approximations might introduce uncontrolled biases in the correct characterization of the dynamical properties of the contagion process Here we investigate the effect of time varying connectivity pattern of networks on contagion control strategies by considering the spec ic class of activity driven network models In particular we consider the susceptible infected susceptible IS contagion model and derive analytically its critical immunization threshold in three different control strategies We also validate the dings obtained in synthetic networks by studying the effect of each strategy in large scale mobile telephone call data set The class of network models we consider is based on the activity rate of each node This is the probability per unit time to establish interactions with other individuals The activity rates are assigned according to given pro ba bil it distribution The generative network process is de ned according to the following rules see Fig At each discrete time step the network starts with disconnected vertices ii With probability each vertex becomes active and generates links that are connected to mother randomly selected vertices iii At the next time step all the edges in the network are deleted All interactions have constant duration de ning the timescale describing the evolution of the network In the following without loss of generality we will sett Activity driven networks are random and memory less The full dynamics of the network and its ensuing structure is thus completely encoded in the activity distribution We consider heavy tailed distributions of activity Ba that reproduce the behavior observed in real data for number of real world networks and more generally found in human behavioral patterns The following calculations can be easily extended to any fun ional form of the activity distribution Although activity driven models in their simplest formulation do not account for many features such as link persistence homo phil yet they allow the analytical formulation of the con current network and contagion process dynamics in the form of appropriate mean el equations thus allowing the quantitative study of the dynamical process of interest We study contagion processes in activity driven models using the basic IS model Each node at each time

Quantifying Human Mobility Perturbation and Resilience in Natural Disasters Qi Wang John Taylor Human mobility is influenced by environmental change and natural disasters Researchers have used trip distance distribution radius of gyration of movements and individuals visited locations to understand and capture human mobility patterns and trajectories However our knowledge of human movements during natural disasters is limited owing to both lack of empirical data and the low precision of available data Here we studied human mobility using high resolution movement data from individuals in New York City during and for several days after Hurricane Sandy in We found the human movements followed truncated power law distributions during and after Hurricane Sandy although the value was noticeably larger during the first hours after the storm struck Also we examined two parameters the center of mass and the radius of gyration of each individuals movements We found that their values during perturbation states and steady states are highly correlated suggesting human mobility data obtained in steady states can possibly predict the perturbation state Our results demonstrate that human movement trajectories experienced significant perturbations during hurricanes but also exhibited high resilience We expect the study will stimulate future research on the perturbation and inherent resilience of human mobility under the influence of natural disasters For example mobility patterns in coastal urban areas could be examined as tropical cyclones approach gain or dissipate in strength and as the path of the storm changes Understanding nuances of human mobility under the influence of disasters will Civil Engineering Network Dynamics Lab Charles Via Jr Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Virginia Tech Blacksburg Virginia USA

Nov Social media nger prints of unemployment Alejandro Llorente Manuel Garc Herr anz Manuel Ce brian Esteban Moro Abstract Recent wide spread adoption of electronic and pervasive technologies has

Multi path Energy Conserving Routing Protocol for Lifetime Improvement of Wireless Ad Hoc Networks Omar Smail Bernard Cousin Zo uli kha Mek kaki and Rac hida Mek ki Abstract Ad hoc networks are wireless mobile networks that can operate without infrastructure and without centralized network management Traditional techniques of routing are not well adapted Indeed their lack of reactivity with respect to the variability of network changes makes them difficult to use Moreover conserving energy is critical concern in the design of routing protocols for ad hoc networks because most mobile nodes operate with limited battery capacity and the energy depletion of node affects not only the node itself but also the overall network lifetime In all proposed single path routing schemes new path discovery process is required once path failure is detected and this process causes delay and wastage of node resources multi path routing scheme is an alternative to maximize the network lifetime In this paper we propose an energy efficient multi path routing protocol called OMR LM Ad hoc On demand Multi path Routing with Lifetime Maximization which preserves the residual energy of nodes and balances the consumed energy to increase the network lifetime To achieve this goal we used the residual energy of nodes for calculating the node energy level The multi path selection mechanism uses this energy level to classify the paths Two parameters are analyzed the energy threshold and the coefficient These parameters are required to classify the nodes and to ensure the preservation of node energy Our protocol improves the performance of mobile ad hoc networks by prolonging the lifetime of the network This novel protocol has been compared with other protocols AOM DV and ZD AOM DV The protocol performance has been evaluated in terms of network lifetime energy consumption and end to end delay Keywords Ad hoc network Multi path routing Energy efficiency Network lifetime node transmission power level In the following we refer to the

Dynamic Address Allocation Algorithm for Mobile Ad hoc Networks Aks hay Khat ri Sank alp Kol he Dr Nu pur Giri Vive kan and Education Society Institute of Technology Mumbai India Mobile Ad hoc network MANET consists of nodes which use multi hop communication to establish connection between nodes Traditional infrastructure based systems use centralized architecture for address allocation However this is not possible in Ad hoc networks due to their dynamic structure Many schemes have been proposed to solve this problem but most of them use network wide broadcasts to ensure the availability of new address This becomes extremely difficult as network size grows In this paper we propose an address allocation algorithm which avoids network wide broadcasts to allocate address to new node Moreover the algorithm allocates addresses dynamically such that the network maintains an IP resembles topology state In such state routing becomes easier and the overall overhead in communication is reduced This algorithm is particularly useful for routing protocols which use topology information to route messages in the network Our solution is designed with cal ability in mind such that the cost of address assignment to new node is independent of the number of nodes in the network Index Terms MANET Dynamic Addressing IP addressing auto configuration In this paper we propose an Address allocation algorithm

On Demand Routing Algorithm with Mobility Prediction in the Mobile Ad hoc Networks Trung Ki en Vu Sung oh Kwon School of Electrical Engineering University of Ulsan Ulsan Korea Abstract In this paper we propose an ad hoc on demand distance vector routing algorithm for mobile ad hoc networks taking into account node mobility Changeable topology of such mobile ad hoc networks provokes overhead messages in order to search available routes and maintain found routes The overhead messages impede data delivery from sources to destination and deteriorate network performance To overcome such challenge our proposed algorithm estimates link duration based neighboring node mobility and chooses the most reliable route The proposed algorithm also applies the estimate for route maintenance to lessen the number of overhead messages Via simulations the proposed algorithm is ve ried in various mobile environments In the low mobility environment by reducing route maintenance messages the proposed algorithm sign cant ly improves network performance such as packet data rate and end to end delay In the high mobility environment the reduction of route discovery message enhances network performance since the proposed algorithm provides more reliable routes Keywords Mobility Prediction Longest and Stable Route Link Duration Probability End to End Delay Low Latency

Anchor Free IP Mobility Mohammed Al Khalid Nikolaos homos Martin Reed May AL Na day and Dirk Tros sen Abstract Efc ent mobility management techniques are critical in providing seamless connectivity and session continuity between mobile node and the network during its movement Current mobility management solutions generally require central entity in the network core tracking IP address movement and anchoring tr afc from source to destination through point to point tunnels Intuitively this approach suffers from cal ability limitations as it creates bottlenecks in the network due to sub optimal routing via the anchor point Meanwhile alternative anchor less solutions are not feasible due to the current limitations of the IP semantics which strongly ties addressing information to location In contrast novel path based forwarding solutions maybe exploited for feasible anchor less solutions In this paper we propose novel network based mobility management solution that facilitates IP mobility over such path based forwarding substrate Our solution exploits the advantages of such substrates in decoupling path calculation from data transfer to eliminate the need for anchoring tr afc through the network core there by allowing ex ble path calculation and service provisioning Furthermore by eliminating the limitation of routing via the anchor point our approach reduces the network cost compared to anchored solution through bandwidth saving while maintaining comparable handover delay We evaluate our solution through analytical and simulation models and compare it with the IETF standardized solution Proxy Mobile IPv PM IPv Evaluation results illustrate sign cant saving in the total network cost when using our proposed solution compared to its counterpart Index Terms IP over CN Mobile IP Proxy IPv LTE GPRS Handover cid
