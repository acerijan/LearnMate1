Mixed Reality States in Bidirectional ly Coupled Inter reality System Vada Ginta ut as and Alfred Hub ler Center for Complex Systems Research Department of Physics University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign Urbana Illinois Dated November We present experimental data on the limiting behavior of an inter reality system comprising virtual horizontally driven pendulum coupled to its real world counterpart where the interaction time scale is much shorter than the time scale of the dynamical system We present experimental evidence that if the physical parameters of the implied virtual system match those of the real system within certain tolerance there is transition from an uncorrelated dual reality state to mixed reality state of the system in which the motion of the two pen du la is highly correlated The region in parameter space for stable solutions has an Arnold tongue structure for both the experimental data and for numerical simulation As virtual systems better approximate real ones even weak coupling in other inter reality systems may produce sudden changes to mixed reality states Although increasingly sophisticated real time com put er simulations of the real world are created everyday to date there has been little to no research done on the physics of the pairing of virtual system and its real world counterpart often referred to as an inter reality system Virtual systems are often created to model real systems as accurately as possible with great pains taken to eke out additional realism Aside from virtual worlds designed for entertainment examples of accurate virtual models of the real world abound in high energy physics accelerator work Furthermore computer simulation can feature unidirectional coupling to the real FIG Experimental apparatus Fig shows aside view world as in the case of black box trading in nance detail of the pendulum housing pendulum is attached to or the dynamic clamp in neuroscience The uni di slotted disk of angular encoder in housing Fig rect ional coupling can also be from the real world to shows top view of the apparatus pendulum in housing is attached to lever arm with pivot points driven the simulation as in the case of data driven modeling by actuator The pendulum has length of whereby live measurement data is incorporated into an cm and the adjustable distance cm cm from executing application This has been used for creating the pendulum to the pivot point controls the strength of the accurate real time models of systems ranging from com plex vortex ow to human cancer cells The next dc aim teed sio in lets hse cao nu gpu lil arg dci os npsl at acne mt of th aer re dA lsu mind is step is to examine an inter reality system in which there measured from the vertical is bidirectional coupling In this Brief Report we present experimental evidence the buoyancy of the pendulum in the air the added mass for transition from dual reality state to mixed reality due to the pendulum dragging air with it as it moves and state in an inter reality system featuring bidirectional in half dozen other eec ts in order to reproduce the me st anta neo us coupling The experimental phase diagram sure period to precision of seconds All but is in the form of an Arnold tongue There is good the most sophisticated computer simulations will use ap agreement between the experimental data and si mula proxima ions when it comes to modeling physical ys tion We demonstrate that even simple model taking tem into account single degree of freedom and using only lin ear damping is uci ent to give rise to this mixed reality As an example of virtual system coupled to are alone we choose horizontally driven physical pendulum as the state It is often di cult and prohibitively expensive to create model that predicts all observable parameters of real system The horizontally and vertically driven ph ys system in the real world to maximum precision Even ical pendulum has been described in the literature computer model of the familiar physical pendulum in The known equations of motion accurately model the dy air must take into account linear and quadratic damping nam ics of the system to create physically accurate vi tu al pendulum we need only to make real time si mula tion based on these equations The experimental physical pendulum is lightweight very thin wooden rod with Electronic address vg in tau uiuc edu length cm diameter of mm and mass of Electronic address hub ler uiuc edu The pendulum is connected directly to the roller

Unreal ROX An eXtremely Photo realistic Virtual Reality Environment for Robotics Simulations and Synthetic Data Generation Pablo Martinez Gonzalez Sergiu pre Alberto Garcia Garcia Alvaro over Alvarez Sergio Or ts Escola no and Jose Garcia Rodriguez Abstract Data driven algorithms have surpassed traditional techniques in almost every aspect in robotic vision problems Such algorithms need vast amounts of quality data to be able to work properly after their training process Gathering and annotating that sheer amount of data in the real world is time consuming and error prone task Those problems limit scale and quality Synthetic data generation has become increasingly popular since it is faster to generate and automatic to annotate However most of the current datasets and environments lack realism interactions and details from the real world Unreal ROX is an environment built over Unreal Engine which aims to reduce that reality gap by leveraging hyper realistic indoor scenes that are explored by robot agents which also interact with objects in visually realistic manner in that simulated world Photo realistic scenes and robots are rendered by Unreal Engine into virtual reality headset which captures gaze so that human operator can move the robot and use controllers for the robotic hands scene information is dumped on per frame basis so that it can be reproduced of in to generate raw data and ground truth annotations This virtual reality environment enables robotic vision researchers to generate realistic and visually plausible data with full ground truth for wide variety of problems such as class and instance semantic segmentation object detection depth estimation visual grasping and navigation Index Terms Robotics Synthetic Data Grasping Virtual Reality Simulation cid

Recent Advances in Object and Hand Pose Estimation Vincent Le petit vincent le petit en pc fr LIG Ecole des Ponts Un iv Gustave Eiffel CNRS Marne la Valle France Abstract object and hand pose estimation have huge potentials for Augmented Reality to enable tan gi ble interfaces natural interfaces and blurring the boundaries between the real and virtual worlds In this chapter we present the recent developments for object and hand pose estimation using cameras and discuss their abilities and limitations and the possible future development of the el Object and Hand Pose Estimation for Augmented Reality An Augmented Reality system should not be limited to the visualization of virtual elements integrated to the real world it should also perceive the user and the real world surrounding the user As even early Augmented Reality applications demonstrated this is required to provide rich user experience and unlock new possibilities For example the magic book application developed by Billing hurst and Kaz Billing hurst et al and illustrated by Figure shows the importance of being able to manipulate real objects in Augmented Reality It featured real book from which virtual objects would popup and these virtual objects could be manipulated by the user using small real shovel This early system relied on visual markers on the real book and the shovel These markers would become the core of the popular AR Toolkit and were essential to robustly estimate the locations and orientations of objects in the space geometric information required for the proper integration of the virtual objects with the real book and their manipulation by the shovel Visual markers however require amo dication of the real world which is not always possible nor desirable in practice Similarly magnetic sensors have also been used to perceive the spatial positions of real objects in order to integrate them to the augmented world However they share the same drawbacks as visual markers Being able to perceive the users hands is also very important as the hands can act as an interface between the users intention and the virtual world Haptic gloves or various types of joysticks have been used to capture the hands locations and motions In particular input pads are still popular with current augmented and virtual reality platforms as they ensure robustness and accuracy for the perception of the users actions Entirely getting rid of such hardware is extremely desirable as it makes Augmented Reality user interfaces intuitive and natural Researchers have thus been developing Computer Vision approaches to perceiving the real world using simple cameras and without having to engineer the real objects with markers or sensors or the users hands with gloves or handles Such perception problem also appears in lds such as robotics and the sci en tic literature on this topic is extremely rich The goal of this chapter is to introduce the
