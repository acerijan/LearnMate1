Quantum mechanics vs local realism is that the question Emilio Santos Depart men to de Fi sica Universidad de Cantabria Santander Spain July Abstract The conjecture is made that quantum mechanics is compatible with local hidden variables or local realism The conjecture seems to be ruled out by the theoretical argument of Bell but it is supported by the empirical fact that nobody has been able to perform loophole free test of local realism in spite of renewed ort during almost years During the last three decades many experiments have been performed aimed at ruling out any local hidden variables LH theory In spite of the ort some dec ien cie in the proof remain the most important being described by locality and detector ec ien cy loopholes According to recent reports the two loopholes have been closed However each loophole has been closed in die rent experiment That this is not enough to refute all LH theories has been pointed out by aid man agree with that paper except for point which will be commented below Therefore shall not spent time in repeating the arguments which may be summarized as follows The existence of loophole means that quantum mechanics and LH are actually compatible for the experiment and therefore the experiment is unable to discriminate between quantum mechanics and LH theories The fact that quantum predictions are ve ried certainly reinforces our belief in the correctness of quantum theory But the experiment says nothing against LH theories

Bernoulli Sieve Alexander ned in Department of Mathematics Utrecht University Post bus TA Utrecht The Netherlands Abstract Bernoulli sieve is recursive construction of random composition ordered partition of integer This composition can be induced by sampling from random discrete distribution which has frequencies equal to the sizes of component intervals of stick breaking interval partition of We exploit Markov property of the composition and its renewal representation to derive asymptotic of the moments and to prove central limit theorem for the number of parts The Bernoulli sieve can be seen as generalisation of the game found in The rst round of the game starts with players and amounts to tossing coin with probability for tails Each of the players tosses one time and the players ip ping tails must drop out If all get heads the trial is is qua lied and must be repeated completely with all players as many times as necessary until some players do quit If at least one player remains after the rst round the second round continues with the remaining players who must toss another coin with probability for tails The game lasts with probabilities for tails until all players are sorted out It is assumed that the probabilities are independent random variables with given distribution on and that given Xj the individual outcomes at round are conditionally independent It follows readily that as far as only the number of players is concerned the outcome of round depends on the past solely through the number of players which proceed that far random composition of integer arises with part being the number of players dropping out at round In this paper we shall focus on some properties of in particular we are interested in the distribution of the number of parts of the composition which may be thought of as the duration of the game There is natural way to settle all on the same probability space in consistent fashion Consider random interval partition of by points and assign each player random uniform tag independent of the The tags group within the intervals and recording the cluster sizes from the left to the right yields composition intervals containing no tags are ignored To establish equivalence with the coin tossing construction we only need to note that the chance for particular player to remain for at least rounds in the game is precisely The game in corresponds to supported by single point in which case the are all equal The composition is induced then by sampling from geometric distribution and of course had appeared many times in the literature under die rent guises Karl in distinguished this case in the context of general occupation problem with inn it ely many boxes and derived

The Future of Nuclear Energy Facts and Fiction Chapter III How un reliable are the Red Book Uranium Resource Data Michael it mar Institute of Particle Physics ETH Zurich Switzerland October Abstract For more than years the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD countries and the International Atomic Energy Administration of the United Nations have published biannual document with the title Uranium Resources Production and Demand This book known as the Red Book summarizes data about the actual and near future nuclear energy situation and presents the accumulated worldwide knowledge about the existing and expected uranium resources These data are widely believed to provide an accurate and solid basis for future decisions about nuclear energy Unfortunately as it is demonstrated in this paper they do not The conventional worldwide uranium resources are estimated by the authors of the Red Book as million tons Out of these million tons are assigned to the reasonable assured category and million tons are associated with the not yet discovered but assumed to exist inferred resources Our analysis shows that neither the million tons of assured resources nor the million tons of inferred resources are jus tied by the Red Book data and that the actual known exploit able resources are probably much smaller Despite many shortcomings of the uranium resource data some interesting and valuable information can be extracted from the Red Book Perhaps most importantly the Red Book resource data can be used to test the economic geological hypothesis which claims for example that doubling of uranium price will increase the amount exploit able uranium resources by an even larger factor The relations between the uranium resources claimed for the die rent resource categories and their associated cost estimates are found to be in clear contradiction with this hypothesis mail Michael it mar cern ch

Are two resources really better than one Some unexpected results of the availability of substitutes Gian giacomo Bravo Lucia Tam buri no Abstract The possibility of exploiting multiple resources is usually regarded as positive from both the economic and the environmental point of view However resource switching may also lead to unsustainable growth and ultimately to an equilibrium condition which is worse than the one that could have been achieved with single resource We applied system dynamics model where users exploit multiple resources and have different levels of preference among them In this setting exploiting multiple resources leads to worse outcomes than the single resource case under wide range of parameter cong rations Our arguments are illustrated using two empirical situations namely oil drilling in the North Sea and whale hunting in the Antarctic Keywords resource management paradox of enrichment environmental sustainability

Network Risk Limiting Dispatch Optimal Control and Price of Uncertainty Bao sen Zhang Student Member IEEE Ram Raja gopal Member IEEE David Tse Fellow IEEE Abstract Increased uncertainty due to high penetration of renewables imposes sign cant costs to the system operators The added costs depend on several factors including market design performance of renewable generation forecasting and the spec ic dispatch procedure Quantifying these costs has been limited to small sample Monte Carlo approaches applied spec ic dispatch algorithms The computational complexity and accuracy of these approaches has limited the understanding of tradeoffs between different factors In this work we consider two stage stochastic economic dispatch problem Our goal is to provide an analytical quant cation and an intuitive understanding of the effects of uncertainties and network congestion on the dispatch procedure and the optimal cost We rst consider an un congested network and calculate the risk limiting dispatch In addition we derive the price of uncertainty number that characterizes the intrinsic impact of uncertainty on the integration cost of renewables Then we extend the results to network where one link can become congested Under mild conditions we calculate price of uncertainty even in this case We show that risk limiting dispatch is given by set of deterministic equilibrium equations The dispatch solution yields an important insight congested links do not create isolated nodes even in two node network In fact the network can support back ow in congested links that are useful to reduce the uncertainty by averaging supply across the network We demonstrate the performance of our approach in standard IEEE benchmark networks

Estimation of Joint Distribution of Demand and Available Renewables for Generation Adequacy Assessment Zachary and Dent December Abstract In recent years there has been resurgence of interest in generation adequacy risk assessment due to the need to include variable generation renewables within such calculations This paper will describe new statistical approaches to estimating the joint distribution of demand and available VG capacity this is required for the LOL calculations used in many statutory adequacy studies for example those of GB and PJM The most popular estimation technique in the VG integration literature is hind cast in which the historic joint distribution of demand and available VG is used as predictive distribution Through the use of bootstrap statistical analysis this paper will show that due to extreme sparsity of data on times of high demand and low VG hind cast results can sue from sampling uncertainty to the extent that they have little practical meaning An alternative estimation approach in which marginal distribution of available VG is re scaled according to demand level is thus proposed This reduces sampling uncertainty at the expense of the additional model structure assumption and further provides means of assessing the sensitivity of model out puts to the VG demand relationship by varying the function of demand by which the marginal VG distribution is re scaled Keywords power system planning power system reliability risk analysis wind power

ALGORITHMS FOR NON LINEAR AND STOCHASTIC RESOURCE CONSTRAINED SHORTEST PATH AXEL PAR MEN TIER Abstract Resource constrained shortest path problems are usually solved thanks to smart enumeration of all the non dominated paths Recent improvements of these enumeration algorithms rely on the use of bounds on path resources to discard partial solutions The quality of the bounds determines the performance of the algorithm The main contribution of this paper is to introduce standard procedure to generate bounds on paths resources in general setting which covers most resource constrained shortest path problems among which stochastic versions In that purpose we introduce generalization of the resource constrained shortest path pro lem where the resources are taken in mono id The resource of path is the mono id sum of the resources of its arcs The problem consists in ding path whose resource minimizes non decreasing cost function of the path resource among the paths that respect given constraint Enumeration algorithms are generalized to this framework We use lattice theory to provide poly no mi al procedures to nd good quality bounds These procedures solve generalization of the algebraic path problem where arc resources belong to lattice ordered mono id The practical ec ien cy of the approach is proved through an extensive numerical study on some deterministic and stochastic resource constrained shortest path problems

Moderate deviation analysis of major is ation based resource inter conversion Christopher Chubb Marco Toma michel and Kamil Kor ze kwa Centre for Engineered Quantum Systems School of Physics University of Sydney Sydney NSW Australia Centre for Quantum Software and Information School of Software University of Technology Sydney Sydney NSW Australia We consider the problem of inter converting nite amount of resources within all theories whose single shot transformation rules are based on major is ation relation the resource theories of entanglement and coherence for pure state transformations as well as thermodynamics for energy incoherent transformations When only nite resources are available we expect to see non trivial trade between the rate rn at which copies of are source state can be transformed into rn copies of another resource state and the error level of the inter conversion process as function of In this work we derive the optimal trade in the so called moderate deviation regime where the rate of inter conversion rn approaches its optimum in the asymptotic limit of unbounded resources while the error vanishes in the same limit We nd that the moderate deviation analysis exhibits resonance behaviour which implies that certain pairs of resource states can be inter converted at the asymptotically optimal rate with negligible error even in the nite regime

MONOTONES IN GENERAL RESOURCE THEORIES TOMAS GONDA AND ROBERT PEK KENS Abstract central problem in the study of resource theories is to nd functions that are non increasing under resource conversions termed monotones in order to quantify resourceful ness Various constructions of monotones appear in many die rent concrete resource theories How general are these constructions What are the necessary conditions on are source theory for given construction to be applicable To answer these questions we introduce broad scheme for constructing monotones It involves ding an order preserving map from the pre order of resources of interest to distinct pre order for which nontrivial monotones are previously known or can be more easily constructed these monotones are then pulled back through the map In one of the two main classes we study the pre order of resources is mapped to pre order of sets of resources where the order relation is set inclusion such that monotones can bede ned via maxi mi zing or minimizing the value of function within these sets In the other class the pre order of resources is mapped to pre order of tuples of resources and one pulls back monotones that measure the amount of distinguish ability of the die rent elements of the tuple hence its in for mati on content Monotones based on contractions arise naturally in the latter class and more surprisingly so do weight and robustness measures In addition to capturing many standard monotone constructions our scheme also suggests sign cant generalizations of these In order to properly capture the breadth of applicability of our results we present them within novel abstract framework for resource theories in which the notion of composition is independent of the types of the resources involved whether they are states channels combs etc Contents
Qu Resource Aware Functional Programming Language POOR INGLE The University of Kansas PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION Managing resources le handles database connections etc is hard problem Debugging resource leaks and runtime errors due to resource mis management are di cult in evolving production code Programming languages with static type systems are great tools to ensure erroneous code is detected at compile time However modern static type systems do little in the aspect of resource management as resources are treated as normal values We propose type system Qu based on the logic of bunched implications BI OH earn and Py which models resources as rst class citizens We distinguish two kinds of program objects restricted and unrestricted and two kinds of functions sharing and separating Our approach guarantees resource cor rect ness without compromising existing functional abstractions For concrete example we consider the case of le handling In Haskell le being closed twice or le not being closed at all may cause run time errors but it not ag ged as type error We represent separating functions functions that do not share resources with their arguments using and sharing functions functions that share resources with their arguments using In Qu the type signatures of the le handling API explicitly states that they are separating in nature This accounts for closing the le handle more than once Each program object needs to be explicitly dropped if it has to be treated as are source as in linear type systems Ahmed et al Bernard yet al Mazur ket al This accounts for failing to close the le handles Exception handling in Haskell can be done using Monad Error Lian get al However it does not give systematic way of cleaning up resources in case of run time exceptions We consider the case where critical section of the code throws an exception as shown in Fig The OF describes the fact that the computation can throw exceptions while IO does not The catch function has sharing argument hence it can access the le handle fh declared in the part of the code that can throw exceptions and close it before exiting to prevent memory leak open File File PathI OF ile Handle read From File File Path close File File Handle IO IO Either String String read File File Handle read From File path OF String File Handle do fh open File path write File String fh read Line fh File Handle let caps OF File Handle close File fh return Right throw Exception IOa catch do close File fh catch OF Exception IOa return IOa Left read file error Fig File and Exception Handling in Qu Extended abstract submitted to CFP RC Research Advisor Garrett Morris garrett it tc ku edu
Lets Share Game Theoretic Framework for Resource Sharing in Mobile Edge Clouds Fa he em Za far Student Member IEEE Kin Leung Fellow IEEE Don owsley Life Fellow IEEE Pri th wish Bas Senior Member IEEE An an th ram Swami Fellow IEEE and Jian Li Member IEEE Abstract Mobile edge computing seeks to provide resources This in contrast with running applications on user devices to different delay sensitive applications This is challenging with limited processing capability or deep in the Internet problem as an edge cloud service provider may not have ufc ent usually allows one hop communication between edge resources to satisfy all resource requests Furthermore allocating available resources optimal ly to different applications is also clouds and applications in order to provide the required challenging Resource sharing among different edge cloud service processing power and reduce application latency The goal providers can address the aforementioned limitation as certain for any ME service provider is to provide resources to service providers may have resources available that can be applications as much as possible resulting in an increase in rented by other service providers However edge cloud service application satisfaction and utility for the provider However providers can have different objectives or utilities Therefore fundamental limitation of ME is that in contrast to traditional there is need for an efc ent and effective mechanism to share resources among service providers while considering the cloud platforms and data centers edge clouds have limited different objectives of various providers We model resource resources and may not always be able to satisfy application sharing as multi objective optimization problem and present demands for resources In addition to commercial settings solution framework based on Cooperative Game Theory CGT this problem of limited resources also occurs in military We consider the strategy where each service provider allocates networks For example ME service providers are equivalent resources to its native applications rst and shares the remaining resources with applications from other service providers We to military coalition partners who own various parts of the prove that for monotonic non decreasing utility function the computing resources game is canonical and convex Hence the core is not empty and To address resource scarcity different solutions have been the grand coalition is stable We propose two algorithms Game proposed in the literature such as purchasing more resources theoretic Pareto optimal allocation GPO and Poly and rous to meet peak demands using resources from the same service Polygamous Matching based Pareto Optimal Allocation PPM POA that provide allocations from the core Hence the obtained provider located at distant location or sharing resources allocations are Pareto optimal and the grand coalition of all the among co located mobile edge clouds However purchasing service providers is stable Experimental results con rm that our more resources to meet peak demands is not an efc ent proposed resource sharing framework improves utilities of edge solution as the newly purchased resources may not always cloud service providers and application request satisfaction be used Furthermore it is not always possible to accurately Index Terms Cooperative game theory core edge cloud predict peak demand Hence delays in purchasing additional resource allocation resources may introduce delays in satisfying the applications Similarly using resources of the same provider at distant

Controller tuning in power systems using singular value optimization Amer Mesa no vic Ulrich Mun Rolf Find eisen Abstract As the share of renewable generation in large power systems continues to increase the operation of power systems becomes increasingly challenging The constantly shifting mix of renewable and conventional generation leads to largely changing dynamics increasing the risk of blackouts We propose to retune the parameters of the already present controllers in the power systems to account for the seemingly changing operating conditions To this end we present an approach for fast and computationally ec ent tuning of parameters of structured controllers The goal of the tuning is to shift system poles to specie region in the complex plane for stabilization or oscillation damping The approach exploits singular value optimization in the frequency domain which enables scaling to large systems and is not limited to power systems The ec ien cy of the approach is shown on three systems of increasing size with multiple initial parameter iz at ions Keywords Pole placement singular value optimization stabilization linear matrix inequalities

Resource distillation in convex Gaussian resource theories Hye jung ee Carlo Spar ciar and Mario Berta Department of Computing Imperial College London London SW AZ UK Department of Physics and Astronomy University College London London WC BT UK It is known that distillation in continuous variable resource theories is impossible when restricted to Gaussian states and operations To overcome this limitation we enlarge the theories to include convex mixtures of Gaussian states and operations This extension is operationally well motivated since classical randomness is easily accessible We nd that resource distillation becomes possible for convex Gaussian resource theories albeit in limited fashion We derive this limitation by studying the convex roof extension of Gaussian resource measure and the ngo on to show that our bound is tight by means of example protocols for the distillation of squeezing and entanglement
