2006 Mustang GT  Doesn’t disappoint
"DREAM CAR  I bought mine 4/17 with 98K. Have been wanting a V6 5-sp, '05-'09 vintage for years. The engine is fine. Sounds good. Great mileage. Good power. I pride myself on smooth take-off and gear changes, but this is the orneriest transmission I've ever used! The difference between idle and 4000 rpm is about 1/8"" on the gas pedal, so starting-out without either stalling or way over-revving takes a LOT of finesse. Gear changes are very difficult to master smoothly without lurching. The ride is very harsh with a lot of road noise, which I suppose goes with a quasi high-performance car. My '01 S-10 is quieter and smoother. All that said, it's a smokin' hot looking car, and still fun to drive. This was the first-off of the modern 'Stangs. Hopefully these problems have been ironed-out since."
Fun stang  Only had car for one week and this car put the fun back into driving.Even though it's a V6 it still get up and goes.I love the way it handles and turns heads.
"Live axle  I am a Ford/Lincoln Mercury Tech for 38 years. I have owned three Lincoln Mercury MK-VIII 's and compared to this Mustang, Ford missed the mark . The handling is not near as good compared to the MK-VIII. I have taken curves on a every day basis at high speeds and the Mustang will feel loose in the rear end. This is due to the live axle. The Mustang is a fun car and quick, but would have better handling with an independent suspension. But all in all this is a very fun car to drive for a 58 year old young man. Note - the Mustang will pass just about everything except a GAS STATION. "
The best car around!  This car gets great gas mileage and is the best car you could buy.
"keeps on beeing just great  Owning the 612 now over 3 years and using it in evey day traffic it just keeps on being great,The paint job is the only problem, technical it's fantastic and by far the best car i ever owned.."
"Incredible Ride, Sticker Shock, Low MPG  Best controllable acceleration ever witnessed in a vehicle.  Breaking is mind blowing.  Handling exceptional (except tears through $400 tires). Seat comfort and visibility are the best I have witnessed in Ferrari lineup, and I am lucky enough to have owned 3 prior."
"612 Scag The Best!  The engine is strong pulling right up to 7000 rpm, handling is excellent, yet remains fairly quiet interior wise unlike our former Aston.   612 really is an enjoyable car!"
"612 Scaglietti! Quietly the Best Ferrari Ever!  This car, the 612 Scaglietti,  is overlooked compared to the Spider and Enzo, however it performs better than any Ferrari I have ever owned or driven in.  People go nuts over this car when you ""run it."" It has the comforts of a Cadillac, yet the performance of a Viper.   I am truly extremely satisfied with this Ferrari."
"612 After One Year  The reliability of this car is only fair. I initially had severe computer problems that started the car on 6-cylinders and after two minutes switched to 12 cylinders. The car shook and sputtered for those two minutes. This was corrected after two visits in which a computer re-programming took place. Now I have my check engine light constantly flashing even after being deactivated, twice. It again recently activated, and I have to bring it in again for the third time. "
"Exquisite  I have had this top of the line Ferrari and it's the best of the three that I've had. I wanted to get an Enzo, but it is too much money. The 612 Scaglietti is nicer and cheaper. I also have a Bentley GT which drives much better."
"Not an everyday car  I just purchased this Black on Black with yellow stiching 612 and it is EXCELLENT! Peoples' jaws drop and heads are flying from all directions when I drive by. The exterior is great with side scallops which look great and lines that cut between the headlamps. The rear trunk has two additional storage compartments which is great. The interior is supperb with automatic climate control, automatic headlamps, rain sensing windshield wipers, electric seats, heated seats, electric mirrors, and rear seats are just as comfortable as the front ones. I warn you though this is not an everyday car, considering I payed over $300,000 dollars it. The steering mounted sport button is 10 times better than normal auto."
"612 Ferrari is Fabulous!  This is the first Ferrari I have owned where the ride can be tolerated everyday, yet performance was not sacrificed.  It is a very enjoyable car, I cannot think of anything else I would want to drive right now."
"612 Incredible! With backseat!!  If you have any family or friends, forget about the 599.  Yes it's an incredible vehicle, but performance is nearly identical with 612, and you can bring others with you comfortably.  Extremely happy with the Ferrari, more so than any of the previous ""3"" we owned over an eleven year span."
"The 70's  I will be 70 in March and my wife of 46 years will be 69/39 in September 2007.  My wife's friends at ""Curves Gym"" drive convertibles and we had a GT PT Cruiser that was boring us to death. So we went looking for something to make us feel younger and have something we can have for years to come (5 speed 300hp).  The car is a 10! Mileage beats our Cruiser in city and highway.  ""GO FOR IT"""
"Disappointed!  When I first purchased the car I was extremly thrilled. However, after few days I discovered so many faults in the car. The handling and performance of the car is amazing!! However: 1. The car had very strong smell of fuel inside. 2. Every hole in the road sounds like if the car was going to break down. 3. The handbrake did not stop the car! I sent the car to the Ferrari shop which tried several times to fix it. The service was very good however, the car continued to have the same faults. In my opinion $260,000 car should be perfect. This car is worth only for racing, not for daily use.  Don't buy this car.  Thanks"
"Lovely Driving at Any Speed  Be it cruising or racing on the freeway, this car is pure pleasure. IT has enormous reserves when doing overtaking maneuvres.  It is also very stable on the road, goes straight like it is on rails and is very agile in corners.  It also is very good in the winter or when driving on wet slick streets."
"612 Scaglietti F1 is Pure Joy  This car provides stunning performance without sacrificing the comfort.  The engine is downright frightening. The F1 shifts are flawless. The interior is not cramped with room in the back for small kids or quick dinner adult trips.  I truly can't get enough of this car.  Yes downright expensive ""close to 300 thousand"". However I am satisfied after purchase."
"612 Scag  Is Dynamite!  This car has grown on my like a weed!  The straight line tracking and solid acceleration on a fairly large body, is almost mind boggling!  When you pull up to valet the 612 Scaglietti, you are swarmed like nothing ever witnessed.  Quality has been good, although a few minor electronic computer gremlins that were fixed with a software update."
"612  I got my manual 6 speed in June of 2005 and it has exceeded my expectations. It is truly everything that a gentleman's GT car should be. Stunning styling, great craftmanship, easy to use controls, and of course great performance. It also has enough room to load up friends and/or luggage and take off ona Grand Tour, something you can't do in a Lambo."
"Ferrari 612 Scaglietti Worth The Wait!  Absolutely Awesome!  This car is so fast, and handles like a ""Lambo"" without the backbreaking jarred ride.  So glad I purchased this vehicle.  I will only drive the 612 Ferrari model."
"612 Scaglietti: THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!  No imitator here.   Purchased this car for the Speed, Comfort, and ""CLASS"".   Waited nearly Two years, but honestly worth it.    Bentley, Aston, Lambo, no longer carry this type of Ferrari substance, nor its price tag.    Extremely satisfied with this 4.0  0-60 large, safe, comfortable sports car.    Truly in a world of its own. "
"2005 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti - The Ferrari Best Ever  This car has an outrageous BMW 7-Series-like ride, with awesome handling and braking.  Its seats are outstanding.  The back seats have enough room.  the car even comes with a full trunk.  It actually gets decent gas mileage.  This is my third Ferrari in nine years and it is truly my favorite to date."
"Not What it Seems  When I first bought the 2005 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti, I was anticipating the greatest experience of my life.  It was a great car the first couple of days, but it lost its excitement fast.  The lack of a sporty design tends to not turn as many heads, but the power will take you off the line faster than any other car you will find."
"Best Ferrari Ever  After ordering a Ferrari 360 Modeno and finding it too small for my 6'4"" frame, I decided to order the 456GT to be remodeled. Ferrari didn't know exactly when it would be coming in, so I just transfered my deposit and waited over four and a half years.  I recieved all the artists drawings, engineering pictures and eventually the final pictures of the first two cars to be shown at the Detroit auto show. Upon picking up my 612 Scaglietti I was first impressed with how solid it felt and how quiet and comfortable the interior was. Its instrumentation is simple, the stereo is great but what you get from this car mostly is an eye catching exotic car that isn't too exotic. Being over 40 years old it is the best car in the world to me."
"My Best Car in Twenty Years  What a great car! Tons of speed, a roomy interior, great sound system, and good mileage.  The convertible top is a cinch to operate. And the car is a real head-turner! Expect to get a lot of attention when you're driving one of these. "
nice  this is the smoothest Ferrari ever.  It is a better drive than the 575.  It will out drive any Aston Martin.
weekend road coach  One is easily distracted by all the thumbs-up received on the road - Just enjoy
GREAT CAR  Fast and fun to drive
"A dream car I wouldnt trade for any othe  I am fortunate to be able to afford just about any car in the world but would not exchange it for any other.  This car is the ultimate in beauty, luxury, performance and adrenaline stimulant.  The car looks gorgeous with the top up or down. It is a shame that it has a great sound system because it stays off so that you can hear the engine.  It is not fussy about usual road dips and driveways.  Room enough for a family of four to sit and enjoy a ride. I even had medium sized adults squeeze in the back for a ride! "
V12 SUV  I've owned this beauty since Dec. 458 Spider prior scared me into a trade. Best GT car by far. Passes in no time. Listen to the scream...
"LOVE IT! :)  This car is amazing, i thought it would be a good investment because it is a rare build.  I hope that i am correct.  My wife wants to dirve this car 24/7!!!  My son wants to take it to prom!!! it shows that everyone wants this car.  !!!!!!"
"Power windows?  No power windows in this car, yet it is 
still the best car I have driven and by 
far it gets the most looks"
Best Car  Perfect Car thats all there is.
My Ferrari rocks  The Ferrari is very fun to drive and so

"My Dream Car  All my life I wanted a Mustang, and I'm glad I waited till now to buy it. The mix of the old body style, in and out sold me on this model. Handles like a sports car should, road hugging smooth that pulls threw any curve. Power is more than enough, there may be faster, but I don't see people breaking their necks to look at the grandma styled competitors. Going top down is an experience everyone should have. From 6 to 6o year olds, I've had them all point and compliments abound. "

"car review  i loved it, i hit a strait away and got 
it up to 210 with no problem..."
"9.5  Its fast, it looks good, its got great 
handling,and in my opinion its near 
perfect."
"Amazing  This car is specatcular to drive, the 
technological advancements to this car 
are amazing. The car is amazingly 
stable, i dont even know why i am not 
calling it a rocket. It is stunning in 
person. This car has no lack in 
anything, the only complaint i have 
with ferrari is that the mclaren F1 is 
many years older and it took them this 
long to beat it...that just shows the 
quality and craftsmanship put into the 
design and bmw's engine....if you have 
the money but this stunner!!"
Ferrari ENZO  I think that this car is very well made 
nan
"the best ferrari in history  After driving several high end sport cars including the Porsche turbo, f430 Spyder, Porsche 996 cab, my new Ferrari 599 is beyond anything one could imagine. It is fast (0-60 in 3.6 seconds) , comfortable as a Mercedes SL 65 and in my opinion the most beautiful modern Ferrari ever built. Top review."
"Stang tastic  On a warm summer day, top down, music blasting, yet you can still hear the rumble of the V-8 engine.  When you put your foot into the throttle it jumps like a thoroughbred race horse.  There's nothing like cruising with the top down."
"Exceptional All Rounder  The Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano is the best to ever come out of the prestigious marque. It's supremely fast but also tame enough to drive anyday. The engine is a 6.0L V12 derived from the Enzo. 611 horsepower is what you can expect. The car can really do anything you want it to and if you make a mistake on the road, it is much more forgiving than the likes of other RWD cars. Performance is amazing and the handling is almost to the level of the Bugatti Veyron. Anybody who has a passion for cars must take this out for a drive. The 599 hits every benchmark of supercar performance. Its a fantastic car that must be experienced first hand to get the most out of it."
"A Monster  Incredible driving experience.  Ride and quality is second to none.  The music of the V-12 along with the incredibly comfortable seats and power to take you anywhere, anytime is beyond compare.  The F-1 is very fast and intuitive.  A very balanced feel of superior steering, brakes and throttle. A much smoother ride than I ever imagined out of a super handling car."
"Best fun on four wheels  Own a Gallardo. my first Ferrari purchase. Should have done it long time ago. It is true what they say about Ferrari and the Challenge Stradale is an awesome car. Power, handling, stability and the fun quotient are beyond anything else."
"Challenge is to find a Challenger  Love the car, the only one better that 
I own is the F50.  The power is great 
and is so much fun actually putting it 
down on the road.  Shifting is a bit 
notchy at anything under 8/10ths pace, 
but the only complaint is the lack of 
quality stero to compliment the song 
of the V8.  Forget everything else, 
there is no substitute, and wait until 
it gets improved with a little 
tweaking."
"Gone baby gone!  Being a twenty one year old about to 
begin pilot training in the Air Force, 
I'd have to stay that this car gave 
Uncle Sam a run for his money. Driving 
this car was a blast! If you have 200K 
to drop on a car, get this one. You'll 
turn heads as you roar down the 
stretch, trust me."
"Standard of Excellence!!!  Smooth, fast ride!  Never want to leave 
the steering wheel!"
to die for  this is one of the best cars i have

"Can't touch it for the money  For what is really an inexpensive car, I have had more fun driving daily than any other vehicle I have ever owned.  The level of performance that is available right off the showroom floor for $30k cannot even be contemplated by any other car.  Throw in the fact that Ford understands and embraces the aftermarket phenomenon for Mustangs, and that the car is built for add-ons, and it can be a fun hobby.  Spend an extra $10k in upgrades and you have a car that challenges Porches, and blows away Corvettes.  Great job on this one Ford, now work on the rest of your line."

Carefree at Last  Started with a Ferrari 355 and moved up to the 360 Modena Coupe. This is an amazing car with great performance. It's enginer is very smooth and has a sound that only comes from a Ferrari.  The Daytona seats and upgraded stereo are a must.  This car draws a crowd everywhere you go. 
Outstanding vechicle  Fun-nest car I've owned
"360  This is my secound Ferrari, body shape 
is so nice... "
"Speed  Overall, its a Ferarri"
"Kick Ass Car  I own several high end cars and this is 
one of my favorites, i like it much 
better than my gallardo, and its up 
there with my GT2.  Even though a the 
Porsche Turbo can out perform this car 
this car definetly gets you more looks."
top of the world  nothing like any other car on the road 
"awesome  I've always wanted a retro style Mustang and now that I've got it, I couldn't be happier.  Excellent handling and enough power in the V6 that you don't need to drop the extra for the V8.  Seat belts are tight, but that adds to the sports car/power feel.  I have people stop me almost every day to compliment my car. Wouldn't have gotten it without the Pony package.  Just adds exactly what is needed to make this one incredible machine!"

"ferrari 360  I have always wanted a Ferrari since I 
was old enough to know what one was.  
It is much much better and more fun 
than I had imagined.  Great sounds, 
great looks and you get a lot of looks, 
too.  A car that brings a smile to my 
face every time I drive it!"
"Excellent  Best in it's class, the nearest 
competitor is the Porsche GT2.  
Roughly the same price, but doesn't 
have nearly the same comfort or style."
"the car to be proud of  the funest car to drive better than 
the Lambo Gallardo, people stop and 
stare at you in it, you do have to 
watch the car with the speed ticket 
though they mount up pretty fast"
"Ferrari 360 Convertible  This is the fourth ferrari i have owned 
and I think that it is the best Car ive 
ever driven. the time and perfection 
they put into these cars, the design 
and the motor makes these cars 
perfect. Also the maranello is another 
perfect ferrari"
"I'm a Pro!!!!!!!!!!!  I think this car is very interesting, 
the reason I put fun to drive so low is 
because my feet are too big to fit the 
pedals.  Another problem is that none 
of my relatives can fit in the car.  
And my little brother doesn't fit in 
the trunk. "
"Nice!!!  Th is car is a great car to own.  Great 
when you have money for this, I enjoy 
riding in mine everyday when I head 
out to work."
good car  I like this car.
"Best bang for the buck!  This car is the most exciting fun vehicle I have ever owned.  It turns heads with its styling and not only performs well off the line and accelerating at higher speeds as well as taking off ramps, but also with the fantastic sound system!"
review of my car  awesome experience with this car
"Disappointed  This car is a piece of junk. After waiting my whole life to buy a Ferrari, it broke down the first weekend I had it. Got it serviced, worked fine for a week and broke down again. Just take a look at the Ferrari forums online and you'll see how unreliable these cars are. It perplexes me that a car as respected as a Ferrari can be so terrible. As with all Ferraris, your mechanic will spend more time worth it than you will. I got rid of mine and will never but a Ferrari (or any Italian car) again."
Damn what a nice car!  The purchase of my ferrari was the best

"360 Modena review  Awesome car I've owned for 12 months. Incredible performance, styling and fun factor! A ""10"" all the way. Big money but you get what you pay for. Incredible car!"
"A magnificient, but unreliable beauty  Stalled the first day I had it. Engine warning light came on second day. After a week the ""Slow Down"" warning light came on and it would occasionally not start...unless you had someone rock the car back and forth while you tried to get the transmission in to neutral using the paddles. It has been in the service garage longer than my own garage. It's under an extended warranty. It is an absolutely gorgeous piece of art though and it converted me (a Lamborghini enthusiast) to Ferrari when I saw it at the dealership. It is the most beautiful looking Ferrari in my opinion - better looking than the newer F430. The sound is great also. The glass hood over the engine is a nice touch. "

"Well worth the wait!  Previous mustang owner (1980) and have had a serious stalking issue with this car since Ford introduced the '05 model.  I don't care too much for the look of the 09-11 models, and recently found an '06 and bought it from the original owner.  He drove it a lot (70k miles), but took good care of it and she looks sweet.  So much fun to drive and decent gas mileage too.       "
"Michelle's Review  This car has been an absolute dream to own and drive.  For a woman who has always loved Mustangs, this is possibly a perfect match.  The handling is great for cruising, it really hugs the curves.  All 300 horses, given the room to run, performs wonderfully.  For people who love to listen to tunes, the system can't be beat."

"If only I could afford the V-8  My mother has a 6 banger '04. My '06 pony package is far superior in every category (not taking into account fuel). Yeah, I have a lead foot. With a GT I would be in jail as speeding is way too easy with the Pony.  The handling is nice for such a heavy car but for the money you can't beat it.  Be ready for some road noise, but get the Shaker sound system and you'll never notice it.  I've only put 5000 miles on it but haven't had a single problem other than the frequent compliments.   "

Love my 2006 Silver Stang  This V6 is surprisingly fast. I am sorry it's not the GT but price was prohibitive. Mainly use this on weekends when top down driving is the most fun. I like the fact that the V6 exhaust has a pleasant sound although I'm told switching to the right side GT muffler will improve the sound. Won't sound like a V8 but a more throaty sound none the less. I'm considering it but my selling dealer says a different muffler could void the engine warranty. I don't buy that but I'm afraid to take the chance. Maybe after the warranty expires.

This car is just like it except: this car has better steering (no dead spot in the steering), doesn't shake going over bumps, has a great radio, top doesn't leak, cowl doesn't leak (no more wet carpet), windows don't rattle, and yes, the gauges all work.  All in all, this car has all the great styling I remember with none of the bad things I had tried to forget!"

funnnnn  The car drives like a big heavy American car. Nostalgia like a Mom's car but is hot and sharp at the same time.  It feels very safe and is exciting the way it holds the road and has pick up like most V8s.  The dash could be a little more Mercedes-ish but I like the chrome and design.  Great speakers and upgraded music system.  Pretty bad on fuel economy.

"new mustang 2006  I have owned many Mustangs from a 66GT, 85GT, 93LX, 99GT and a 91 GT that I traded on this car. This is far and away a better designed and assembled car. The automatic transmission in this car is the best shifting overdrive Ford transmission yet. It accelerates and shifts very fast for a stock car yet is smooth when driving normally. The power top is quiet and goes up and down quickly. The controls are laid out well and everything is within the drivers reach. The stereo is the Shaker and sounds okay (speaker placement is difficult in a convertible) but could be improved with the upgrade to the 1000. The fit and finish is the best I've seen from Ford. No matter where you go people stare."

"Ford Mustang GT Deluxe Convertible  This is a great car to cruise in, to commute in, and to have fun being ""bad"" in.  The power and the sound of the throaty exhaust will always put a smile on your face.  Therapists should have very little business from owners of this vehicle.  It looks great, handles surprisingly well, and has power to spare.  My only regret is that I did not buy this car a year ago!"

"166K miles and still going strong  I drive a lot of miles, at least 150/day.  I just had the water pump replaced at 166,000 miles and decided it was time to do the rest of the maintenance that I have neglected for the last 5 years.  I changed the oil regularly with Mobil 1 and changed the brakes when necessary.  Other than that everything has always worked perfectly.  I replaced the spark plugs at 140,000 miles just because.  The originals still looked good, just needed a gap adjustment."
"2006 Mustang GT  Big bang for the buck. Roomy enough for two and space for luggage. Great styling inside and out. Constantly get positive comments on redfire color and 20"" wheels and tires. Great handling and breaking. Acceleration is great and lays rubber on command. Great rumble from dual exhausts--may upgrade to Ford racing exhaust. Worth every penny of $31,000 price tag!"

Amazing Car - Too much fun  The car is fun to drive and very comfortable during distance driving. I've owned it 2 months and still can't get the smile off my face. The only negative is the interior. The plastic is cheap but the overall car makes up for it. The car is a head-turner.

"Built on the cheap  The 2006 Mustang must have been built with cost the most important item. It has no under hood light, foot well lights or daytime running lamps. Small items to be sure but should not add to the total cost. The five speed transmission does not shift smoothly. Was told by the dealership that nothing could be done. "

"I love it!  I bought it at end of March.  Had to contact 17 dealers to get a GT convertible,with a manual transmission. People are always staring and telling me how much they love this car. I never thought a car could make you more popular but this car has.  It drives great, The top is very easy to manage, the pickup and speed are great. This is truly a great Mustang. If you can go for the convertible, and V8. My wife and children used to say I was starting to drive like an old man. They can't believe how I've morphed into a speed fanatic. I would buy it again it I had it to do over.  So far no mechanical problems or bugs to work out. Thats about it."

"mid life Ford  I have been looking at a convertible (mid life thing) for a long time.  For the price, style and fun-to-drive, the Mustang was the one. Metallic red, parchment top, parchment leather seats. I wanted a GT, but the loaded pony/premium with 500 watt stereo  with the v6 was great-especially since a GT this loaded was many thousands more, and beyond my budget.  I love this car and have rarely put the top up in the almost 3 weeks I have owned it. Funny how the CD's sound so much better!  How does one go through life without driving a convertible?  Having had classic cars in the past, I wanted something that would last, and have excellent parts AND service availably wherever I want to travel."

"Best Stang yet  Best Mustang ever. I love the styling even better than the Shelby GT500. Handling, ride and acceleration is outstanding. Interior is easy to maintain, comfortable and fits the character of the car. It avoids the ""Tokyo by Night"" over abundance of electronic doo-dads that distract from a true driver's car."

"Max Lives  I purchased this Horsey in memory of my dad, Max M. Kruger a design engineer and an original member of the Mustang design team under Lee Iaccoca at Ford.  Compared to my 2 previous '73 Mach I joys, this Steed is more stealthy, has greater visibility and obviously more technologically refined. Had only one real issue with her.  The trip meter occasionally zero's itself even after extensive dealer repairs and tech help from Ford. Yes a few rattles. Also needed a new battery due to Florida heat. Got a set of General Ulimax HP tires and they are the best I ever owned. I'm not sure which I like better, watching my wife drive off in her, me driving us, or just looking at her.  Max Lives!"
"Mustang GT   I waited for Ford to bring back the Mustangs that I loved from the 60's. My GT convertible is a great car to drive. It has power, styling and the car sounds great. "

on GT's GT Convertible  I picked this car in October of 05 after waiting 4.5 months for delivery. It was worth the wait. Ford hit not just a home run but a grand slam. Exceptionally powerful and comfortable cruiser. The world seems a better place when you are cruising in this future collectible with the top down. All of 65-69 Mustang styling cues in one package!

"Absolutely A Fun Car...  Always wanted a little pony, and what I got was one with a lot of power and a pretty smooth ride for a sports car.  It is the most fun to drive and it is definitely a head turner with its top down.  I have had more compliments on this car than i had during my 35 years of driving!  I've had the car about a month now and I find it very comfortable inside and easy to drive. The stereo is super. I love the idea of the changing interior colors on the dash as well as the other features you would expect in a luxury car. The exterior is awesome. I have yet to take it on a long trip to see the gas mileage highway driving. I recommend this car to anyone looking for a sports car."

"Not Your Father's Mustang!  While vacationing in South Beach (Miami), my wife and I rented a convertible. We liked it so much we decided to buy one. But let me tell you this Mustang GT is no ordinary convertible! This car is much faster and handles better that advertised. The interior in our opinion isn't too shabby either! We really like the retro styling. It is quite similar to the Mustangs of the 60's and 70's. That is where the similarities end. The ride is unbelievable for a car this price. The interior is so quiet for a convertible And we haven't been able to detect any cowl shake. With the tires provided (Pirelli Zero Neros) you have to go out of your way to make this thing slide even a little. A very nice car!"

"Fun to drive  I bought this car in Sept. of 05 and have only put 700 miles on it, but what fun miles they've been! Best bang for the buck by far. Handling, acceleration, braking and that infectious eye appeal are just some of the highs you'll have while driving this all American beauty."

"Overall performance of this car.  I just purchased my new 06 convertible Mustang.  All black!  This car is amazing.  Drives like sports car and the same time feels like you are driving an old Cadillac.  I was considering getting the V6, but after driving the V8 with manual transmission, I was convinced  that the V8 was my answer for my new toy! (hands down). If you're thinking about getting this car as an extra car for fun driving then I would recommend the manual V8.  If you enjoy music and have an extra few dollars then get the Shaker1000. "

"Larry's Fourth Mustang  Sounds great for a six cylinder.  Great pick-up/power for a six cylinder - plenty of power.  Not too pricey for a sporty car like this - reasonably priced. Good buy for the money.  Shaker 500 sound system sounds great.  Gas mileage - about 20 mpg around town - is satisfactory.   I've had Camaros, Trans-Ams, a Corvette, and Mustangs, and this is my favorite so far."

Awesome Ride!  Always wanted a Mustang convertible! I have a Shelby Mustang so performance & fun is important. The price & insurance was surprisingly low. I lost my company car due to cost containment and never shed a tear with this as my personal replacement for transportation to and from work.

"Car is really fast  I test drove many other sport convertibles, but liked the ride of the Mustang best. I would have picked the Honda 2000, but it is so tiny, you better be 135 lbs and 5'5"". The Nissan 350Z was nice, but you feel every bump in the road. This car is great except the quality of the interior for the price. I had an F150 Lariat, and the interior quality was far better equal price. The leather seats are very nice, but at 5'10"" I find my knee resting against the center console. The stereo is outstanding for a factory unit, but I could tell no difference in the quality between the Shaker 500 and the 1000 even though the 1000 comes with a sub in the trunk."

"Great car, couple of issues  Dash board rattles, dealer couldn't fix it, filed lemon law got $2000 from Ford. Brake pads & rotors went at 12,000 miles witch is unheard of, $600- $800 job. Replaced bat after 3 yrs which is norm. Replaced fuel filter which is recommended. Rear brake bulbs have been replaced about 4 times (easy to do yourself though) other then that nothing major has gone wrong. I drive 12,000 a year, some highway road trips and still drives great."
"The Red Beast  I’ve owned my red V6 Mustang for about 6 years now, it had 89k miles on it. It’s at 139k now. The car has never let me down or given me any problems. Regular maintenance and oil changes every 3k miles of course. I’ve had to fix the exhaust a couple occasions, due to potholes. It’s my daily driver all year in Wyoming. I’ve had it through some pretty rough snow too. I ride snow tires all year also, they’re just nicer tread quality in my opinion. And I drive a lot of gravel. I’ve been stuck once, but shoveled and threw chains on to get out no problem. And during some winter storms I chain up regularly to reach the highway. Everything in the car works. It burns very little oil. It’s fast enough and looks cool. Lots of after market mods available. I plan to get new shocks and struts next as they are looking rusty, but they still feel stiff. I average 20-23 miles on the highway. The value on these cars is way more then the few thousand dollars you can buy one for now."

"I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! THE BEST CAR EVER!  I absolutely love this car. I have had it for several years now.  I am now at over 220000 miles. I have considered buying a newer car but I am having a difficult time parting with this car. I bought it used and have only had minor issues that I really cannot complain about. The windows stopped working at separate times and the motors were replaced. The fuel pump was replaced. That's the only issues I have had with this car and I am not complaining. I keep up with maintaining the oil changes regularly as I do a lot of driving. I have had so many compliments on this car. It is a beauty. Many people think it is a GT. I cannot say enough about this vehicle. I purchased it used from a family who took excellent care of it. It had about 134000 miles on it when I bought it. I am surprised at how roomy the trunk is and how much I can actually get in there. I cannot tell you how many times I have heard ""I love your car"".  I have had newer cars than this and they may have been more roomier or higher priced but I would not trade this one in for any of them. I have decided to keep it until I can't keep in anymore. I just can't part with a car that has been so awesome! If you are considering buying this car don't hesitate but do your research. I bought from an honest family who took great care of this car. I also did a carfax before purchasing. I could not be happier with my 2000 Ford Mustang! Take care of it and it will take care of you."

Takes a licking  This car won't stop.I've had it for 15 years and had no major problems besides recalls. I call it 'ol reliable. It always starts and runs like new. I've had no degradation of gas milage or performance. It's too bad that the resale value is so low for such a reliable vehicle.

"Kick butt old school  I avoided admitting my appreciation for late-model GTs for a long time just because it was so un-P.C.  But when the '99s came out I was intrigued.  I bought my black 2000 5-speed as a lightly-used and nicely-equipped example (leather, Mach 460 stereo, etc.) in mid-2001.  Words cannot express how much I loved that car.  I drove it for 12 years and nearly 180,000 virtually trouble-free miles before trading it in on my current 2013 GT 5.0.  The good:  great performance, chunky masculine style that turns heads, cheap to maintain, very reliable, just the right touch of attitude, the sound of a 2-valve V-8 roaring through an H-pipe, reasonable economy for the performance, a good level of practicality for what it is.  My kids fit in the back.  Limitless aftermarket modifications and go-fast parts supply.  My dealer is great.  You're the coolest dad at your kids' school.  Keeps everyone at church guessing.The bad:  not much.  There are cars with better quality interior trim, more refinement, and nicer fit and finish.  But anyone buying a Mustang knows it's no Lexus.The ugly:  the backwards-hat crowd in bespoilered front-drive compacts with fart cans always wants to show off in front of you.  Your neighbors may hate it, especially if you install Flowmasters and do a full-bore romp on the gas pedal at 6 a.m.  Or at least they'll think you're a hoon.  Self-righteous European car owners may think you're tacky (full disclosure...my wife has a newer BMW X3, we're just not full of ourselves over it).  Cop bait.  Bottom line:  If you want a fast car that is reasonably practical and has just the right dose of good-natured obnoxiousness built in, you've come to the right place.  For any pre-2005 Mustang I recommend welding in a good set of subframe connectors to stiffen up the body structure for the long haul, and then driving the heck out of it."

"It saved me!  My first beautiful 2000 Mustang V6 coupe, purchased in 2010, saved me when some tattooed meth freak hit my driver's door at 60mph as I was making a left turn on a small two lane (no passing zone). I was dazed but the car was totaled, as was f-wit's Honda. He walked away, donchaknow. The replacement, another base 2000 coupe, is even nicer, with fewer miles and the same excellent reliability. It has a bit of clutch chatter, but nothing's perfect. I enjoy every mile and am happy to have some steel wrapped around me! "

How much do I love my mustang?I put the car in heated storage and I visit it a couple times a week...and admire it.Sick???13years old just turned 100k never seen winterBut still oiled and dripping.Works great... Gold and shows so different from red or black.Handles like a dream..with a few upgrades..I still love the heck out of it.Even after driving a 2013 Boss

"Only a few minior issues  I drive very little (about 5k miles per year), but when I do i like to wring it out around town, on the highway, and twisty back-country roads.  This car handles them all very well.  Haven't had any real issues, and have kept up with scheduled maintenance.  I did have a transmission pan leak which was repaired by a dealer; a few months later it was leaking again and the dealer fixed it again (free as was still under warr. then).  I have an extended warranty for peace of mind but don't anticipate needing it.  There has always been a little squeak near the gauge cluster, which I meant to get fixed but it hasn't bothered me enough to do so."
"Mustang Engine Problem  I bought this car 10 months ago at 57,000 miles and have since put on 12,000 miles.I have had no problems with this car since I got it and have done all the regular preventative maintenance and oil changes on date.A rod just broke out of nowhere and now I need to replace the engine.There are only 69,000 miles on this vehicle.This is rediculous.I will not buy another Ford again.I thought of this car as an A+ hands down, and then got blindsided by this incident.Not happy about it and very disappointed."
"Fantastic Car-Unsolvable Safety Issue  The Abarth handles like a dream, shifts smart and easy, looks like great, and keeps driving simple. You get looks and comments from little kids, middle aged wives, and grandfathers. Everybody looks the looks of this Italian sweet heart. But an unsolvable problem plagues this beauty. My 124 spider Abarth's alarm has gone off randomly while driving. I drove her for a few months and it went off numerous times driving under various conditionsShe has been at three dealers with no success yet. This makes her not drivable. FCA is currently investigating numerous similar complaints with no resolution. I hope they can fix her."
Honeymoon never ends  I have had this for a year now and still love it as much as the day I drove it off the lot. No issues since day 1!
"love this car, kid again!  havin a blast! gotta remind myself to be careful because it takes off like a rocket and handles like its riding on rails. just purchased 2 months ago , so don't have any comments regarding durability or reliability but so far its great. would recommend for anyone havin a midlife crisis , lol."
"8 Months research and finally bought the ABARTH  I had concerns over buying a FIAT. Lets face it, lemons are common but some get real good 500 ABARTHS that work well. The fact that Mazda was building the 124 inspired me to look past this. The car itself is 100 times more beautiful that the Miata version. My sticking points were ABARTHs comming to US had FIAT badge on wheel. As of March 2018 that has changed. Abarths now have proper abarth badging on the interior for 2018 but you have to look around as there are many older versions on lots. Next sticking point was that Miata's got the Retractable Fastback and FIAT's did not. What is more Italian that the RF top. Looks like the 70's Targa tops. Fiat could have branded it a Targa and they would not have been able to keep them in stock. I know all my friends were hoping for this as well. UGH! So I bought the ARARTH in Black. Wow the color is so deep and rich in the sunlight. Pictures do not do this car justice. Must see in person. My ABARTH is a bit rough in 1st gear for a manual. Been driving manuals all my life. This one I stalled 4 times on way home from dealer. The car wants to go. Low RPMs the car lags a bit and begs you to let it breath. There are two essential tweaks that fix this. One the DV+ diverter valve allows more low end and solves some issues with the cheap plastic diverter valve that comes from the factory which is either open or closed.... No in between. This DV+ also helps prevent turbo flutter which is potentially damaging buy allowing flow the turbo air flow back though the valve as the turbo winds down between shifts. Much healthier.. Second as the high pressure through the lines can bring with it some oil, it is good to add an oil catch can on these cars to reduce the amount of oil that can get back to the throttle and multiair unit which can be damaging over time. These two changes do help the car become more bullet proof. The car shifts great and has power.. Much more than the miata which I drove several times in my search trying to decide whether to drop the Fiat and just get the targa I love and deal with the angular futurist look of the miata rather than classic Italian beauty. I got the loaded version. I suggest just getting it with all options. Bose system is awesome, Navigation is easy. While touch is disabled when the car is moving, it is easy to manage shifting and using the dial to change channels etc. so the Tech in the car is great. Was able to save all my Sirius Channel Favs on way home from dealer lot. ABARTH sounds great in either Sport of Normal. Noted the Sport mode dials up the performance a bit which did feel more responsive. Im about 5 foot 10 inches tall and hover around 200 pounds and I fit comfortably in the car. If someone is over 6 foot they may find it cramped. I love the gauges and Abarth logos on seats and steering. It gives the car uniqueness and people have no clue what the car is when they see it which Scorpion badges all over it. I was asked at a gas station if it was a Ferarri. Lol I wish. Car takes corners like a champ and those Brembo Brakes really work well. I know that squirrel thanks FAIT for its life. Convertible top is same as Miata and is sooo easy to put up or take down. Chrysler and many aftermarket sites are selling a lot of after market upgrades so this car is very good if you want to make it a track car. But.. I only bought the two items i spoke of earlier. Abarth already has limited slip diff, Front and rear anti sway bars, Front and rear strut tower braces, Brembo brakes, and a killer sounding exhaust etc.. so its more performance than most people need. Im getting around 30 MPG average which totally surprised me. In summary, this car is more than I could have hoped for. I would like to see an aftermarket company make a targa top for this car but outside of that. Its my childhood dream of owning that Triumph TR7 or Fiat X 1/9 Bertone Targa car that I could never find married to modern day conveniences. I want to slap myself for even considering buying that Miata. I would have never forgiven myself. :) I am living my childhood dream of owning and driving a EURO roadster even if it is a Miata in Drag."
"I now love spiders, 124 Spiders!  Know that interior storage space is minimal.  Yet every time I drive this vehicle, I love it just a little more, than the last time I drove it. The wife is now banned from riding in it. My grandson and great nephew concur, that my 124 Spider Lusso is awesome. Top down is a must."
Great car  3 season car - stored in the winter - great little roadster
"Fiat spider part 2  I had a spyder 20+ years ago that was very fragile and had lots of problems. This car is 180 degrees from that. With the exception of the cup holders and glove box which are awkwardly placed, there is nothing I would change. I feel such joy and satisfaction every time I am in this car."
"Fun drive/eye-catching ride not w/o minor glitches  This vehicle is a lot of fun to drive and great to look at inside and out!  The seats are comfortable but a tight fit with just enough leg room for an average size person.  If you are really tall or maybe a little rotund, you are out of luck if you want to drive this car!  After driving this little convertible sports roadster over 2,000 miles, I have had a lot of smiles on my face but also a couple of frowns.  My vehicle came equipped with high performance three season tires which do perform very well when the temperature is above 40 deg. F, but if you live where winter temperatures dip below 40, you have to switch out these tires for all-season or snow tires... an extra expense.  Otherwise, it must be garaged during very cold wintry days.  I replaced the factory equipped tires with high performance all-season tires and they have performed very well for me even in the cold winter months.   Also, the instrument panel's outdoor temperature display at any outside temperatures is pretty much a joke.  It's response is very, very slow and you have to maintain a minimum speed for an extended period of time for it to properly function.  Finally, sometimes the automatic transmission is slow to shift but you do have the option to manually shift but no shift paddles on the Lusso trim."
"So far, so good!  I haven't owned a ""roadster"" since I ditched my 2000 Miata back in 2011 because it was nickle and diming me to death. This 2017 Fiat Spider blew me away. I was seriously considering a Miata again, but after I read a pile of reviews and took several test drives, I was hooked on the Spider. (Plus the local Mazda dealer was jerking me around). Granted, Fiat skimped on the ""Mattel-made"" sun visors and the bland, colorless instrumentation (not even a red line on the tach), overall, it's very easy on the eyes, very well made, and with enough accoutrements or lack thereof to meet most-but not all-budgets. My main complaint is the noise at highway speeds. They indicate in their marketing that it's quieter than a Miata, but it's definitely more noisy than my 2000. The radio is pretty useless at highway speeds, unless you have a headset. At first, I was taken back by not having a spare, but I suppose the fix-the-flat stuff in the trunk will work OK. (Maybe I should read the directions before I need it...?). Oh yeah, and it's a blast to drive. For an aging grown-up, the fit is snug but comfortable, the steering and handling are great, and it has MORE than enough power to get me very quickly from point A to B in style without acquiring too many tickets-I hope!"
"Great sporty car for life in the CA desert  The more appealing look of this car compared to the Miata sold me on it.  I'm over 6 feet tall, and can't put the seat all the way back and fully depress the clutch.  While not roomy, the cabin isn't as small as professional reviewers would lead you to believe, with a surprisingly comfortable ride given the short wheelbase.  It's a bit of a drop to get in, as the car sits low to the ground, but the seat side bolster doesn't hinder access.  Exiting the car is much easier if you're able to open the door fully, as it swings out very wide.  The instruments are easy to read and well lit at night.  When the top is up, there are two pronounced blind spots behind the driver.  If this concerns you, opt for the version with parking sensors, etc.  The radio is nothing terrific, but again, it's much better than I anticipated.  Choose the larger radio touchscreen if your eyesight needs assistance.  Premium gas is recommended, but not required.  So far, I am perfectly happy with my Rosso Classica with Technology Package."
"Still Loving it after 12 years  Bought my Stang new in 2000, would have loved the GT but fell in love with the Gold V6 with the 5 speed.The color still gets compliments today.Have 67K on it, and until yesterday have only had to replace tires, a battery, front brakes,bad window/lock switch and a fuel line which rotted out .Yesterday the clutch blew.I cant even be upset about it.The maintenance on this car has been next to nothing.I love the performance, still has a lot of kick!One bad paint spot on the roof and not happy with the fog on the headlights.Great car and will be buying another when this one decides to go to heaven"
"Fun roadster with fiat reputation behind it  It spends a lot of time in the shop waiting for parts; like months waiting for simple parts (wish that was an exaggeration). The car looks amazing and the Abarth exhaust sounds fantastic. If you're looking for a daily driver that is fun to drive short distances, this is the car for you. It's also the car you need if you enjoy mini-vans and most every other car pulling away from you at their normal pace (unless you put the pedal down and rev the engine like crazy to catch up). It's not a fast car and all the commercials showing it blazing away are pretty much lies. With some modifications it can be pretty quick, but the stock version is asthmatic.  The main issue with this car is quality. After waiting over 2 months for one part, I filed for lemon status on it and was approved (easy in CA), so Fiat is buying it back and hopefully scrapping it to make some useful toasters. Love the idea of this car, but Fiat just can't make a quality car (a very large % of the owners are experiencing parts problems), even when this is mostly a miata. The stock is VERY limited, but don't let that get used to justify overpaying for this Frankenstein (Base abarth with Automatic for 30k out the door, including all taxes/tags/etc...). It's a unique take on the miata, but I'd stay away from the 2017 version of this car (maybe Fiat will get their act together in 2018). After 9 months, my car has less than 4000 miles, mainly due to having driven the complimentary rental cars for a good portion of the year."
"2017 Fiat Lusso 6auto  First off, this car is 75 to 80% Mazda Miata. However, the similarity ends there. The car has a longer nose and much better styling in my opinion.  The Fiat sounds and feels like a sports car.  The 6 speed auto is a Aisen product, which gives the car the ability to shift even faster than a 6 speed manual.  To be fair, the 6 speed auto is enough if you travel the daily freeway commute like me. While I have had the car for less than a week, my sportscar past is not nill.  My father owned a 1988 Mazda RX7 convertible. While the RX7 could take a corner without effort,  the Fiat still does the same but is a bit nose heavy. Why? The Fiat's engine is an iron block, placing more weight over the front wheels.  Yet,  the car takes the corners well.  I am still enjoying my commute, even though I had to give up a Prius Plug-in that gets 50-60 mpg and a free ride in the CA HOV lane.  Who cares, really when the Fiat is much more fun to drive and gets 31mpg on average.  It's your call, but why waste money on a more expensive BMW or Mercedes when you can get an excellent roadster out of the Fiat 124 Spider Lusso.  Have had the car now for six months with no issues."
"Tons of Fun At a Great Price  I've owned a couple of 2-seat roadsters...a 2004 Porsche Boxster, and my 2017 Fiat 124 Spider Abarth.  The Boxster, at close to $60,000 was one of the best pure driver's cars I've ever driven.  That said, for half the price of the Porsche, I get 95% of the driving fun with my Abarth Spider.  I've had the car for about 6 months now...it was one of the first Abarths delivered in my area.  So far, with almost 5,000 miles on it, it has been pure enjoyment.  Since neither my wife nor I are particularly large people we find the cockpit of the Abarth more than comfortable, even on long rides.  The fit and finish is beautiful...ours is pearl white with the black leather interior...it turns heads wherever we go.  I've had many people ask what the car was and have gotten nothing but compliments from everyone.  I'm really glad we got the Abarth...the upgrades are worth it, and make all the driving difference.  The Abarth's quad exhaust has a much nicer note than the Lusso or Classica.  Not that they are bad...just a bit quieter than I like.  The biggest difference is the Sport mode selector on the automatic transmission.  Since my wife opted for the auto, the paddle shifters on the Abarth are a good compromise.  Also in Sport mode, the shifts are much sharper, and responsive.  Overall, this car is a winner for us...great looking, fun to drive, and a great value for the money.  If you're in the market for a great 2-seat roadster, give this one a long look...odds are you won't be disappointed!"
"Permanent grin since the day I brought it home  If your idea of performance is based on quarter mile times, this isn't the car for you. If, on the other hand, carving through canyon or mountain roads is your thing, there may not be anything else on sale at any price that can put as big a grin on your face as this Fiat. Its suspension is better sorted than the MX-5 (less roll, less bumping up against the bump stops) and it has all the power you can realistically use on public roads. It also looks - to my eyes anyway - a more mature / elegant design than the Mazda. This is my third Fiat and - despite the reputation - I've never had a problem with any of them.Only caveat is that if you're more than 6' tall or over 200lbs, definitely spend some extended time in one before committing to the purchase as it is a tight fit."
"Bloody GORGEOUS!  I have been gagging for this car since Fiat/ Mazda bought it to my attention. It has taken me months to drill down and get the car I wanted. All I ever found on my search was automatics!!! ( I love driving and the thought of an automatic is just sacrilege in my opinion) Of course it had to be red, and I opted for the luxury package which is totally worth it especially the LED lights and their capacity to light the road ahead at night. Just outstanding. Its GORGEOUS from every angle. Driving it is a pleasure. Love the torque and relaxed nature of the engine. Would prefer the exhaust a little louder (I have the 500 Abarth and its a mean sounding, just beautiful chorus which is subdued in the 124) Was surprised Fiat didn't option it with the flat bottomed steering wheel that they have in the 500 which is a tactile pleasure, but none the less, it does feel good in the hands along with the shifter and short throws. Italian cars really do it for me, they connect me emotionally which is lacking in other cars. Mazda and Fiat have done a wonderful job and I hope it pays big dividends for them. Would like a boost gauge and cooled seats as the leather gets really hot during the summer."
"Just turned 70. Figured now or never :)  Makes going to the physical therapist - lower back - fun. Fortunately, it comes with a walker :). Love the car. A kick to drive. Got the 6 speed. Comfortable. Handles very well. Grand children love it; kids are jealous. Wife, who swore she wouldn't get in it when I drove on a highway, has recanted and loves it too. Everything I had hoped for... and more."
Wow Love driving this car!  I haven't had this much fun driving a car since I owned a 1982 Nissan 280 Z back in the 80's I love the handling and the way it corners I have the Abarth model and I just love the exhaust rumble the second you start it. The car is just amazing to look at and the convertible top is quick and easy to put it up or back down! I do wish there was little more storage in the interior I don't mind the smallish trunk its big enough for two weekend bags! I can't wait until I get back in it to drive again like right now instead of typing this review!  Update:  after driving it for 6 months all I can say is I love it more than ever I have had ZERO  problems not even a glitch I now store it for our harsh northern winter and really cant wait until next spring to be driving this awesome car again!
"Fantastic Car!  2017 Fiat Spider 124 Abarth, manual with brembo brake pkg.  It is such a joy to drive.  Handles fantastic, beautiful interior, beautiful looking car outside and inside. Love the hood and design of the car.  I owned a 95' 325I for about 9 years, (very good car), and a 2006 330I for about 2 years.  The 330I cost a lot of money in repairs.  I wanted to purchase a 2014 Cayman S but the price of admission for a nicely optioned used one is about $50,000.  I test drove the Fiat Spider and for $31,700 brand new it was a no brainer.  Plus the Spider comes with 4 year 50,000 warranty vs 3 year 36,000 for the Miata.  I still would like to get a Cayman someday (but would like to keep the Spider as a second car) but for now I couldn't be happier with my decision.  I look forward to driving the car everyday.  I'm 6' 1"" and fit comfortably but it would be nice to have about 1 more inch of room so I could get the seat back a bit further ( I also wish the Cayman seat went back about one inch further).  That's why I gave it a 4 star out of 5 for comfort. I test drove the Fiat and then went and test drove the Miata the same day.  The Mazda Club with brembo brakes you can get for about $30,000 and the Spider Abarth is about $31,700 plus tax.  You can't go wrong with either car.  I believe the Mazda handles a little better and is a bit faster.  But for my everyday driving the Spider is just perfect.  It just came down to personal taste.  The clincher being Japanese build quality with Italian styling.  I like the alcantara seat fabric and the Recaro seats.  Plus the quad tail pipes.  They sound great in 1st and second gear but I wish they were louder as you go through the gears.  I love both cars but just liked the looks a little better of the Spider.  If you want wheel locks so some clown doesn't steel your wheels you can get them from the Mazda parts dept. for about $59 or order them online from Good-Win-Racing.com part # 61-1057F for about $99.00.  After reading the comments about the goodwinracing wheel locks I opted for those.  Don't think you can go wrong either choice.  Happy motoring.  And do your self a huge favor, regardless of what your wife or parents or friends say, make sure you get the manual...  Shifting gears is half the fun of owning the car. One year ownership update.  I have put 13,300 miles on the car.  Zero maintenance issues.   Car has been fantastic and dependable.   Took in for scheduled maintenance one time for 72.00.  It's a great car."
"What a great ride!  I purchased this Car November 19, 2016. Its a base model Lusso with no real upgrades. I have had an extended highway trip and several day trips and I have fallen in love with this car. I owned an 85 Fiat Spider 2000 and I am partial to the Italian styling evident in the body design. Needless to say the performance over the 85 model cannot be compared. The 1.4l turbo accelerates on demand and shifts smoothly up and down. I am using the Asin auto transmission. The road handling and cornering are sharp and responsive. Even so, its a smooth highway drive even on long trips. Its not the fastest 0-60 but it is quick. In my opinion, the base sound system is adequate for all but the most serious audio enthusiasts. I stream Pandora thru my phone and the sound is terrific once adjusted for treble, bass and balance. So my major positives are style and road handling. The only major drawbacks are leg room and trunk space. I am 6'1"" and I can fold my knees into a comfortable driving position, but there is not enough room for my big feet. Strangely, I have more than enough head room with the top up. If you have big feet there is limited room for the clutch, hence my selection of the auto trans. Any over 6'2"" will have difficulty driving this car and they will not fit in the passenger seat due to the trim located where the glove box should be. There is very limited storage space inside the passenger compartment. The trunk has enough room for two small duffel bags and a computer bag. That's fine for my use as a weekender car. Price point for base Lusso is very attractive. In my opinion, a lot of the extras in tech package are not necessary or worth the addt expense. Lastly, when people see it they will think its a Miata or they ask what it is. Personally, I do not think it looks that much like a Miata but there are not many on the road yet, so its understandable for mistake. its a great car for those looking for a fun weekender."
"This much fun has got to be illegal  When looking for two seater, drop top roadsters, that capture the fun of driving a curvy, technical back road for a low price, you have a choice of a Miata (Mazda MX-5) or a ?. And Mazda does it well with a light weight, quick, well made and reliable car. But it's styling, for me, was like the rest of the car, superbly functional.  All it needed, was some passion to make it perfect and a little tuning by a culture with a rich road racing history.  Along comes Fiat, to bring it both.  The beautiful throw back looks of the 124 Sport Abarth, added to the MX-5 would have made a great car inspiring, and the looks distinctive, but it would still not be a Italian sports car but rather a better looking Mazda.  But Fiat ripped the heart out of the Miata by replacing its engine with the soul of an Italian. Now it has it own looks and the totally different driving experience that a turbo charged motor brings to a car.  But what about that tuning?  That is where the Abarth model's unique features come in .  The Bilstein shocks added to the front and rear, revised roll stabilizers, limited slip differential, 17 inch wheels with 205 low profile tires, the revised more throaty exhaust that adds four horsepower, - combine to allow the engine, suspension, and even the steering to be dialed in with the sport mode button to transform the 124 from a gentleman's sporting vehicle into a superbly controlled, feisty, canyon carver expert that blows the top off the fun driving chart. This car feels like it is nailed to the pavement no matter the road surface or the severity of the curves.  Add the Brembo brake option as I did, and you can bring down your boiling cup of espresso to a standstill in a heart beat. Put it all together, as Fiat has, and this is the most fun you can have for a $25 tank of gas that will take you 350 fun (did I mention it was fun?) filled miles..  I have only known her for 1000 miles so far, but I can tell you already that if it were possible to marry this car, I would."
"Classic American Muscle Car  I've owned my 2000 Mustang GT for only 9 months, and I've already put it for sale.....how can I write a favorable review of it if I don't even wish to keep it?Yet, the car really is terrific - it just doesn't stir my soul!Mine has 75,000 miles on it (bought it with 65,000), and it has been nothing but pleasure to own.I bought it and immediately lowered it with H&R springs (the wheel gap on 99-04 Mustangs is HIDEOUS), and put a Pro5.0 shifter in it.If I was keeping it, I'd put a set of Flowmasters and 4.10 gears on it.I love the fact that you have a bread and butter V8 in here that anyone can repair (if needed) that still has performance that'll whollop many cars on the road."
"Awesome  Car GREAT Value  Just too many good things to write fantastic looks, tuff strong cool turbo super power and speed.   Great handling with a attitude, loves the road  with the ability to stop.  You just can't not stop looking at the car.  Cool curves, angles, shape, size and style.  The light weight, clean lines, logical and functional interior adds to the retro mid 60's british sports car feel with a touch of the past.  Buy / Drive/  Ride / Sun in the sky one touch top down enjoy the ride!   Silver 124 Classic 6 speed"
"Lusted for this Car at It's Inception !!!  MANY Cars in my life..  But THIS CAR..  Is my Sweetest One Yet !!....  Many Loud Fast V8 Sticks...  At 54, they've started to get on my nerves.. Selling my Mustang GT now since I bought this Car...  Old Roommate in the 80's had a 124 Spider that I borrowed ALL THE TIME, Cuz I LOVED IT !!...  When they announced the Partnership of Fiat / Mazda actually producing a NEW 124..  I Immediately  Thought ... ""THAT'S MY NEXT CAR !!!!  .... Italian Looks / Japanese Build Quality, TURBO !!, Best of Both Worlds... NO REGRETS !!!....   I had to wait 2 months for the Dealer to find my car, since ALL of the Lusso's had Auto's..  In a Roadster??...  NO WAY....   Mine is a Lusso, Meteor Gray / Black,  Every Factory Option, with a 6 speed Stick...  The BOSE Stereo System blows me away ...  Almost 900 Miles now.. and STILL...  THEE BEST Most FUNNEST Car I've EVER OWNED !!!!    EVER !!!...  I'd actually Laugh in your face if you wanted to trade me your new Corvette Z06...   =)"
"Fun Is All There  My previous sports cars include a Porsche Boxster, a BMW M235, an RX-8, and three editions of the Mazda Miata from 2006, 2010 and 2013. I mention that history because the 124 Spider from Fiat is the least expensive ( i paid right at $28K) and in my opinion, the best looking of them all. You might know that Fiat and Mazda joined forces to build this car and the Fiat style and Mazda reliability are a winning combination for me.  None of the Mazda Miata cars required more than oil changes and standard maintenance. Nothing ever went wrong with those cars. I hope the Fiat does that well. If you are a six footer the car might not be as comfortable and the attractive  interior is close at hand. The car is very drivable and steers, brakes and handles well. When most cars slow for turns, i speed up (a little) and the Spider really shows its moxie in corners. Gas prices may not stay this low but i can fill up with premium fuel for about $25. I think people who live in warmer climates or want a fun weekend ride will love this car. The more you like to drive, the more it will appeal to you. Its about as much fun as you can have for not a lot of cash."
"Better than $55,000 Mercedes  Until August 2, 2016 I was ready to buy a 2017 Mercedes SLC300 via European delivery. Then I realized that I'd be paying $55K in advance for a car that wouldn't be in my home driveway for 6 months or more. Just to be sure I was making the right choice, i googled ""2017 convertibles"" and suddenly saw a pic of a car I'd never seen before.  Having done a test drive in a Mercedes, I was impressed with the quiet ride at 70mph on a freeway with top down. I was able to converse with the salesman at normal volume. One thing that totally UN-impressed me was that to start the newest Mercedes you MUST put a key in the ignition!  Within 48 hours of my Mercedes test drive, I was cruising in a 2017 Fiat 124 Spider which seemed just as quiet on the highway and has push-button start. When I started comparing the overall specs of both cars, the new body styling of the 124 Spider and at HALF the price of the Mercedes, it became a VERY easy decision. As the former owner of 2 Porsche, Lotus Esprit, 3 Mercedes SL convertibles and a Rolls, after a month driving my new 2017 Spider I am VERY happy with my choice!3 MONTHS LATER ... I now have just over 1,000 miles on my FERRARI 124. FIAT owns Ferrari which gave me an idea. I removed or covered ALL the FIAT emblems and now drive the ONE and ONLY car that passes for a Ferrari (yes people believe the emblems they see) but costs about 1/8 the price! I even got a Nevada vanity license plate that says NICECAR so if I pass you in a flash and you see the tag, good luck catching me! BOTTOM LINE: Not since my Porsche racing days have I had so much fun behind the wheel of ANY car, regardless of the price !!!"
"After twelve months, we still love this car  After twelve months of ownership, we're still in love with our FIAT 124 Spider. We've taken it on several road trips, some as long as six hours of driving and 400 miles in a day. For a roadster, the ride is excellent. We never feel tired, uncomfortable, or anxious for the ride to be over. It's awesome being able to enjoy the journey as much or more than the destination. For me, the Spider is the perfect blend of comfort, performance, and driving pleasure. Finding a nice twisting road through the mountains is pure joy. The handling is superb and the power is more than adequate to handle any situation whether it's climbing a steep grade or passing a slower vehicle. It stays planted in the curves and corners. The Spider has performed flawlessly with no problems of any kind.  My original review is in the paragraph below.Realizing that a two seat roadster isn't for everyone, if you enjoy driving, or would like to enjoy it and have the luxury of being able to get by with just two seats, the FIAT 124 Spider is a great choice. Unless you just don't like driving, the FIAT Spider is sure to put a smile on your face and make you want to take the long way to wherever you're going. This car isn't a super-powered muscle car, but is light weight, nimble, peppy, and handles superbly. While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, for me, this car is gorgeous. Many sports cars are known for their harsh ride - not the FIAT. While providing great sporting performance, it also has a very comfortable and enjoyable ride with the top up or down. I'm 5'-8"" and the car fits me very well. I can imagine that someone over six-foot would feel a bit tight. I test drove both the automatic and the manual and concluded that, while both are really great, the manual provides an edge higher level of driver engagement and driving pleasure. But, upon the insistence of my wife, I purchased the auto. While I enjoyed the manual, I'm very pleased with the auto. It's great cruising on the open road where you're not shifting a lot anyway, and it's also less of a hassle in city traffic. I couldn't be more satisfied."
"Everything a roadster should be.  Such a drop-dead gorgeous car.  I was immediately won over by its styling.  Handling is impeccable, and ample torque makes it really fun to drive."
"Fantastic Fiat  The Mazda guts are evident in this car and that’s a good thing.The Lusso handles great, looks fantastic and is a blast to drive. Great soft top with added sound deadening to make for a quiet interior when needed. Turbo lag takes a bit to get used to but once you drive the car a bit you learn to increase the revs in 1st and then then enjoy that turbo boost. Safety package is a great add to the Lusso.Can’t say enough about the way this car drives."
Just bought a new FIAT 124 Spider Lusso!  This car is very sporty and low to the ground but is very comparable in style and performance to Mazda Miata while still holding its own in terms of feeling and comfort and design.
"A Go-Kart for Grow-ups!  I came close to buying another MX-5. It's been a few years since my last one and I'm not getting any younger. But after the test drive, I decided to test-drive a Spider at the dealer down the road. To me, it was more refined, inside and out. The ride felt more comfortable as well, and the steering was quick and true. When you gave it the gas and the turbo kicks in, it really gives you a thrill. I'm going on 3,000 miles, with my Classica, and it's still a joy to throw the top down and go for a spin (trouble-free). It's like a go-kart for grown-ups, with a rocket on the back!"
"Test drove this and an Mazda MX5  I test drove both the Fiat and the Miata.  The Miata delivers its power in a more linear fashion.  The Fiat needs to get up in the Revs before it really goes.  So, it feels slower off the line.  A little more like a Honda S2000.  So it is really down to which one appeals to you more.  I would rate the Fiat at a 4 and the Mazda at a 4.5 from an everyday driving standpoint.  However, I am considering this purchase for weekend pleasure drives and I find the Fiat is more exciting to me.  I like the bit of quirkiness that it has over the Miata.  To me this gives the Fiat a bit more excitement.  If you are deciding between the Mazda and the Fiat you really need to spend some drive time in both.  The interior is similar in most ways.  It's really about do you fit and are you comfortable enough to enjoy the car.  Also, I would mention that the edmunds review of the Fiat is a 3 and the Mazda a 4.5.  This seems to me to be because of different editors approach to the car and because the Fiat review, I believe, is for the automatic which I agree is not very good with this engine.  If you want an auto the Mazda is the better choice.  I took a brief drive of each car with the auto but for me the manual is the way to go.  I would recommend reading each edmunds review with the mindset that it applies to both cars outside of the engine.  I am disappointed that Edmunds editors seem to have written these reviews in a vacuum ignoring the relation of the cars to each other."
"One Amazing Car  I have owned my mustang for about 8 years. I purchased it used in 2004 with about 98k on the odometer. Today I am proud to announce I broke the acclaimed 250k mark!!!! The car still runs strong and I'm about to have the transmission serviced for the first time tomorrow at the Ford dealership (my friend recommended I do it, I kept topping off fluid every once in a while, nothing major, no leaks). The car still runs strong, shifts great, smooth ride. Added cold air intake, dual exhaust to give it a better sound and thats about it! Full synthetic oil changes at about 3,500 miles. City & Hwy miles... I love this car!!!!"
"Best car I ever owned  I have a 2018 Spider Luzzo with all the options. It is the most fun car to drive that I have ever owned and this includes 2 Corvettes, a Triumph, and numerous non-sports cars. It would run circles around the 1980 or the 1978 Corvettes I had. The quality appears excellent as I haven't found a single defect. Very comfortable seating, however very tall or obese folks would not fit. The Bose radio system sound great."
"not too bad for the price   bought our car dec’17 . had 35 miles on it . the thing drives like a dream . we had a historic snow storm here and this little car , which i did not think would do as good . i was going past full size 4wd trucks and suv’s like nothing . it was a tank . now roughly 9 months later has about 5700 miles now . had the car into the dealer roughly 5 x for key fob problems . replaced fobs and later entire system and have done others things to make it work proper . still have problems bit kinda gave up on it . the button pads on steering wheel are pretty loose . have little problems here and there but getting fixed . the ride is great . very smooth on virtually any type road . steering is responsive . cannot mash the gas and expect to get moving quick . yes it does have a bit of engine and tranny noises but this is expected as well for this class of car .seats are actually not bad . stiff but cushy at same time . back seat is big enough for a hundred pound dog . and she loves it . good amount of cargo room . if you look at the car it seems small but really it is bigger on the inside . milage is about 22mpg around 29mpg hiway . for the price of our fiat it is pretty good overall . the big problems are the electronics . the style is real nice inside and outside . if i was asked to get another fiat , well about 50/50 . my wife loves it . we are in the city . which is great . it is zippy and that is great for city driving . "
"Had the car about a year, already very disappointe  Decided to lease the vehicle in December of 2016, the car had engine lights come on and had to be towed within 24hrs of getting it home, I was told there was a bad sensor in my side view mirror. About 2 months later, I was driving with my kids on the highway and a “drive mode unavailable” warning came on. I was left stranded on the highway with 2 small children in a new car. They came and towed it, I never got a clear answer for the problem. I told them to check the transmission, which they said was “fine”. They returned the car to me with the warning light off over a week later with the transmission worse than ever. It is not fine, the jerking that occurs from the stop position to first gear is horrible, it is like driving in a manual trasmission car with someone learning how to shift. I have a neck injury, and some days driving this car is like torture. I have owned other Chrysler family vehicles in the past with no issues, I never dreamed I would be this disappointed. I travel for work and drive rental cars three weeks a month, and I don’t see this problem with other manufacturers. Also, don’t expect help from ANY other dealerships in the Chrysler family of you are having troubles, they like to defer you to only Fiat dealerships which are few and far between."
"Best Car I've Ever Owned....  I've been extremely happy with this car. Ride is excellent. Quite and smooth. Great gas mileage!!! Great power!!! Fantastic Handling!!! I feel like I'm driving a sports car. I'm glad the computer has a setting to notify you regarding your speed.  I have mine set for 10 miles above the limit and it is always notifying me as you don't realize how fast you are going.  You can't feel it shifting except when you first start out as it is a little hesitant.  The interior rivals cars that are much costlier. The materials used and fit and finish are excellent.  My biggest gripe is Fiat needs to market this car through their Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler dealers and service them their as well or at worst case scenario require Alfa/Maserati dealers to service at least under warranty. I live in a fairly large metropolitan city and I have to drive 60 to 75 miles to the closet dealer for warranty work. I only wish I drove more but I work out of my house......"
"Well made, enjoyable to drive  My wife and I really love our 500X. It's our second Fiat (we continue to own a 2014 500L). Needless to say, if we've bought a second one, then we must be pretty pleased with our first one (we are!). We purchased our 500X with all the bells and whistles (AWD, safety suite (lane departure warning, lane keep assist, auto emergency braking, back up camera and park assist), leather interior). Our 500X feels very solid over bumps, dips and road imperfections, no squeaks or rattles whatsoever. The 9 Speed transmission is often criticized, but for the most part we're fine with it. It tries to get up into the tallest gear as soon as it can when in normal (when mode selector is in default ""Auto"" mode). I wish it had a 4th mode where it still wanted to shift up to as high a gear as possible for fuel economy, but was more willing to downshift without having to really stop on the accelerator (as is the case in the ""Auto"" mode)- a mode somewhere between ""Auto"" and ""Sport"". The 3rd mode is ""Traction+"", which has you pulling away from a stop in 2nd rather than 1st, plus it engages AWD regardless of whether a wheel is slipping or not, as well as a less aggressive accelerator pedal programming. So far no problems, though our 500L has become my commuter car so the 500X doesn't get driven so much. The suspension provides for a very good ride on the whole, though I'd say I slightly prefer the ride of our 500L a bit (it's wheel base is nearly 2 inches longer, and the lower ground clearance makes for a little bit less bouncy-ness due to less suspension travel).  The fuel economy could be better- I hope FCA is working on a direct injection version of the 2.4 liter 4 cylinder, or perhaps a new engine entirely. Personally I think the 1.4 liter turbo is the superior engine, but to opt for that in the 500X requires that you accept shifting your own gears via 6 speed manual transmission. I will say the 2.4 liter does well enough in suburban driving, especially if you're lucky on the signal lights, as I've seen better than 35 mpg on occasion. I notice that sales figures have the Jeep Renegade outselling the 500X by about 10:1, but I much prefer the X over the Jeep- how it looks and how it drives, even though they are on essentially the same platform. Finally, the 2018's will have Apple Car Play and Android Auto with FCA's latest Uconnect entertainment suite."
"If you are tired of the same old same old....  I have owned over 65 vehicle in my lifetime, and this 500X hits a sweet spot between form and function. It has that either love it or hate it styling ..which I love...the driving experience with the manual 6 speed and turbo 1.4 gives that sense of control and feel for the road that seems missing in most of the made for the masses CUV's out there...its refreshing to be engaged with the driving experience instead being a slave to the computer controlled automatic transmissions that make a mad dash for the highest ratio gearing no matter what speed you are driving. I guess I am one of the 4% ers that still like to row their own gears in this style of vehicle.                   The great part of this vehicle is that it has a 4 year/50K bumper to bumper warranty for a car that is priced with incentives at $15K .  Add to that fact, that the car is well executed in its fit and finish with better quality materials than what would be found on higher grade trim levels from other manufacturers you can drive away from the dealership confident that you are not feeling car poor and still are driving a car that might arouse some envy from onlookers. ......time will tell if the thrill of commanding a fun to drive stylish CUV will fade, but I suspect given the choice of driving my RAV4 limited or the 500X in my driveway I will grab the keys to the FIAT....she is just so much more fun!I have had the car a year now.... still love driving it. The 4cyl Turbo with the 6 speed is in my opinion the better of the two drivetrains. Unfortunately a buyer cannot option the AWD system with this drivetrain arrangement. FIAT only offers a 4wd with their Jeep Renegade that uses the same platform as the 500x with the turbo and manual setup. I knew that when I bought the car and looked at the Jeep... but the suspension tuning and styling pushed me to the 500x ... I have an AWD vehicle so it wasn’t a big deal to forego the option in the FIAT... so far very pleased... lots of compliments on the car from onlookers at gas stations and parking lots..."
"Impressive SUV! Worth every penny.  I moved into the 500x Trekking AWD from my 2013 FIAT Abarth. I really really liked my Abarth but absolutely love my new 500x! I have some physical disabilities and the Abarth was while very fun to drive also hard for me to drive and was starting to find that people just do not see you in that small of a vehicle. Looking for comfort, and size over the Abarth and the high quality of a precision Italian SUV boy did I find it! The new interior of the 500x Trekking is amazing and the technology in the features blew me away! It may take me a month to learn how to use everything this SUV has to offer. Styling is great and the optional 18"" wheel package and AWD I got adds even more tremendous styling. Acceleration is so so but then again I'm coming from the Abarth. Fuel economy is also not real fantastic but still pretty reasonable. Overall I have zero complaints on this SUV. The one serious recommendation I have though is, get either the Trekking AWD or Lounge AWD model. I test drove the Pop and Easy FWD models and they do not even compare. All the bells and whistles with the two higher models are 100% worth it!"
"500xcellent! Even better after one year.  I'm a little biased to the Fiat brand having owned a 128 Sport Coupe in the 70's and currently a 2012 500 Abarth. The 500x was something I wanted but had to do a little arm twisting to get my wife on board. We traded her Jeep Wrangler Sport in and I believe we were both happy to say goodbye to what was probably the most uncomfortable vehicle we've owned. We've sacrificed a little space moving into the 500x but aside from that we really love this vehicle. The ride is really comfortable, handling is precise, acceleration is adequate and it's a treat to drive. That's one thing about my Fiats that set them apart from all the other vehicles we've owned. Plain and simple, they are fun to drive!02/06/2018 - Like a fine wine, this vehicle gets better with age. Still enjoy all aspects of the vehicle very much."
2016 500x fiat engine locked  I got this car after trading in my Nissan Maxima. Dealer said it was a great car reliable good on gas so forth. After having a car for less than 6 weeks the car completely shut off on the interstate. The brake locked car would not start. Take it to the dealership dealership has a minute to diagnose it. They tried to say it was an electrical problem. And truth I don't think they know. Now they're saying the engine has locked up. No problems with car until I had an oil change. If I were you I would not get this car. This car needs to be recalled. It is a safety hazard to anyone and their family. It will shut off at high speeds. Will not start and horrible weather. What's even worse is Chrysler will not own up to the fact that this is not a great car this car is deadly. I almost lost my life. Sat in 90 degree weather until a tow truck came to get me and the car. Was not even offered a rental car. Please do yourself a favor and do not get this car.
"Undervalued, Underappreciated, but Great!!  The Fiat 500X is a joy to drive and will put a smile on your face every time. It has plenty of power, although you won't win many races with it. It is very sure-footed as it has excellent grip and road manners, especially in the frozen stuff with the AWD system. And it is a safe car! I wrecked mine and it literally saved my life. You will enjoy the uniqueness of being one of very few on the road, but don't be concerned. The mechanicals are the same as the Jeep Renegade, so dealer maintenance will always be close by."
"Solid Car  I've owned my 2000 Mustang GT for 4+ years now. Car now has 155K on her and she's still running strong. The only major failures I've had was the Intake Manifold coolant line busting & heater core leaking(major pain to fix). I've really driven this car hard, but always maintained it, and she is still going strong. Please stop listing to idiots bash a car because they 1. they neglect it. and 2. they give a bad rap because of normal Maintenance items they have to replace(rotors/pads/air filters/fuel filters/plugs). On a different note, after a few basic mods, these cars will run with the feared LS1 Camaro's."
After 2 years  Unless it has been improved on the road noise is very annoying on some surfaces. My son and I have done some work on upgrading that issue with sound deadening material and it has helped but still annoying.
"Worst car ever!  I bought this car in December 2015 , 2016 fiat 500x , a month later my nightmare started, I can’t not count how many times my car is being at  the dealer , always is a new problem , electrical problems , motor mount are awful, air conditioning, it was one time my car was at the dealer for two month , ah counting also every time with a rental car , I’m very upset and sad with my car , it was the worst purchase ever, I do not recommend it ,they devalued so bad , I did call fiat to get an advise and see how can I get rid off my car and they told me will be something that I have to resolve with the dealer, I went back to the dealer and they didn’t help me at all, I’m desperate with this car , paying every month for something that I know is a piece of garbage!"
"Horrible experience  At 24113 miles and less than 2 years old, vehicle began stalling after display or numerous different warning lights. Over the course of 7 months, I was left stranded 11 times after stalling on expressway and in town. Each time dealership replaced a part (5 new parts in total) and returned it to me ""fixed"". Warranty is for 5 years and I had extended warranty. Didn't want to trade. Wanted FIAT to fix it. They refused to buy back (it had over 24000 miles and not eligible?!), give be comparable vehicle, or acknowledge it was a lemon and they couldn't figure out the problem. Had to trade and take a financial loss as I couldn't continue to put my family in harm's way. FCA staff were not helpful. Entire experience with FIAT was horrible. Local dealership did as Chrysler/Fiat directed them and they actually stepped up to offer more on a trade they usual and took vehicle ""as-is"" which was still not repaired. I will never purchase another FIAT or recommend to others. Poor customer service and unwilling to accept responsibility for faulty vehicle."
"A non recommended vehicle  I bought the car from the Beaver valley auto mall, Monaca Pa.  September 2016, (47,000 miles) , the car is cute, dark blue Metallic,  it’s not very pavement friendly, because it is a very bouncy  uncomfortable ride , The gas mileage for this vehicle is really horrible bad and starting out from a red light the car is very sluggish. A couple times I thought it was going to stall out on me and then the lights dim to,,,,,,,,,The bottom line is that I regret purchasing this vehicle. And  that I don’t recommend this vehicle to anybody looking for good gas mileage and a comfortable ride, Go with a Another make of a vehicle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,. Thank youAs of today 7-15-18  it really is a cute little car and I did think that gas mileage has improved a little bit ,  but I think the transmission is very choppy and I think the car is still very sluggish,  I am about to take it on a 10 hour trip so we will see what the gas mileage comes to,  but my overall plan is to trade the car in as soon as I can before I put too many more miles on it.    I still don’t recommend anybody buying one of these ........"
"1 year update  I've owned this SUV for 13 months and   I've put 13,500 miles on it and I couldn't be any happier with the little SUV. I'll start off with low points. Fuel economy is just ok, I've averaged 25.4 overall but short trips and very long trips seem to get below EPA min. and the hot Phoenix summers really zap mpgs. More normal conditions yield substantially better mpgs. The back seats are comfortable but really tight and if you have adults back there, the front seats need to be moved up so passengers can fit. The trunk space is small and only holds a few bags and really limits what you can pack. I think the tight space is typical for the class. I've read reviews that say the transmission shifts awkward but I really haven't noticed any issues. The only thing is that there are too many gears and it downshifts really slow. The transmission always wants to be in the highest gear and it makes acceleration slow at times. You have to stay firm on the throttle to get the most out of the engine/transmission. The transmission is noticeable quicker to downshift and stays in a lower gear when it's in sport mode but it drives awkward in parking lots or if you are not driving it aggressively. The car feels like it wants to race in sport mode, the steering wheel tightens up, the engine/exhaust get loud and the shift points are rough--it feels like my friend's Maserati but I don't think most people would want to drive that way daily. It's just fun on an open road.  The rest of the car is all positive. The handling is the best feature and the car feels really fun to drive and connected to the road and driver. The steering is accurate and direct and the brakes are strong. The front seats are super comfortable and there is plenty of room upfront. There is plenty of front seat storage for long road trips. The build quality and materials are first class. The car is really loaded with lots of cool and usable features. The UConnect is awesome but the navigation is kind of old school Garmin and takes too long to program an address but it works well when in use. The car is relatively quiet and it's easy to hear others and talk over the blue tooth. Phoenix has really smooth roads so it's hard to say how the ride feels in rough road locations but it can get a little bouncy on certain roads. I've had no issues with reliability and no repairs as of yet. It's hard to find a car today that has personality and doesn't feel like like every other car on the road but this car has really feel to it. I'm really happy with my 500X and glad I bought it!"
"Unreliable little car; terrible customer service  I have had this car for just over two years -- it has just under 13K miles on it and has been in the shop 9 (yes 9!) times.  There have been 5 problems, including a broken tailgate latch, a broken door handle, a broken speaker, a malfunctioning forward collision mitigation system (which took 5 times to fix!) and now an engine warning light with a message saying ""drive selection mode not available.""  Despite paying an extra $3,000 for an upgraded warranty that includes a loaner car, I have to argue with the dealer every time to actually get that loaner car.  In total I have been without this car for weeks on end and an really tired of taking it in for service and with dealing with uncaring and incompetent service personnel.  For the current problem I have now been without my car for two weeks, and when I called FCA headquarters I was told that the dealership hasn't even looked at it yet...how is that acceptable?  And FCA customer care...they have been of little help.  They denied a lemon law claim and that department refused to even call and tell me.  They had the woman who I spoke to at customer care make the call and she left me a message that sounded like she was being held hostage...she was so apologetic and actually said ""they are making me call you and I'm really sorry they won't respond to you"" -- how often do you end up feeling bad for the customer service staff?  Geez....  So, in summary, let me say that purchasing this car has been a horrible mistake.  Until FCA actually does something to make this right, my new goal in life is to warn others away from purchasing any of their vehicles...buyer beware!!"
"Avoid this car!  I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this car.  I was so excited to get it.  It looks cool and has a lot of nice features, but quality-wise, it is very poor.  Road noise is excessive, I am on my 3rd sunroof so far in the first year due to it being loose and rocking and rattling in the roof.  I am on my 2nd air conditioner unit due to it smelling like mold.  I think water somehow gets into the system and molds in there, so when it is turned on, it smells like mold/mildew.  It is a fun car to drive, but the seats are pretty hard, so it is terrible for long road trips.  My old van was so much more comfortable.  I tried to get the lemon law on this car but Chrysler basically denied any problems.  I have had this car in the dealer at least 2 1/2 months of the time I've had it.  Too bad I bought it rather than leased it.  Now I am stuck with this lemon.  I would stay far far away from this car and Chrysler in general-they are the worst!"
"Love at first sit  I bought my FIAT 500x Lounge gently used. I was actually in the dealership to look at the Jeep Renegade, but the specific one I had come in to see had sold.  I noticed the FIAT and asked if I could test drive it. It was love at first sit. I have a bad neck and back, and it is hard for me to comfortable in a vehicle. The 500x is hands down the most comfortable seat I have encountered. The sporty look, quality of the trim and awesome sound system are just icing on the cake for me.  I will agree that the transmission is a bit 'confused' at times. However, I have learned to drive it so it shifts quite smoothly. It just takes some getting used to.  It rides incredibly smoothly on the freeway. Not the quietest car I have ever driven, but also not the loudest. The road noise is perceivable but not distracting. Overall the FIAT 500x Lounge offers a smooth, solid and sturdy ride with great visibility and plentiful features. I love my FIAT!"
"Trouble from the beginning  First of all it's had like 3 recalls since I bought the car.  It started in November I had a situation where I was making a left turn in traffic and the car said low oil pressure and cut off, it was a stoplight downtown Wilmington I had my nieces with me and car took a few minutes to crank.  We then had received a recall notification on the car so we figured it was related to that we took fiat to dealership to be serviced.  Had the car and it since has been doing it again and putting me in danger as well as my 2 year old baby.  The tires blew out after 4 months of having the fiat, there is no spare with the car so it had to be towed.  Next we had oil changed and was told we have a leak, he said oil levels shouldn't be so low after a recent oil change.  The parking light has also went out, Took car back to dealership to look at oil they kept car and said levels were low but couldn't determine why, drive car for 1000 miles and bring back for another test, meanwhile this morning as I'm heading out in the rain holding my baby the car door wouldn't open with the keyless remote and the car wouldn't unlock, I then pulled out the key to use and unlocked the car the alarm goes of and the car wouldn't crank and the back doors wouldn't open.  I then had To run back in house with my baby and grab my spare keys and they started the car.   As well as gas I was told this car would be great for my long commute and it isn't it's getting like 24 mpg.  I've had nothing but trouble with this car and I'm highly disappointed I was so excited to buy the 500x and now I'm regretful.   I hope fiat resolves this problem with integrity."
Traded in a Honda  More fun & more style. I don't miss my CRV at all. I live in Chicago so 4x4 is required and my 500x stands out from all the other SUVs that all seem to look the same. The Uconnect system is easy to use with great features. Love the quality of the leather interior (10 times better quality than the Honda) and all the hi tech safety features. This car has a personality - love it!
"1 1/2 years late......  I poasted a review of this car when i first got it in the begining of 2010. I have done NO engine or transmission work to this car. It has been very reliable and has never left me stranded. I did have to have it painted because of the cheap paint that ford used. This was my first car, and it's special to me, i named him ""black stallion."" My AC doesnt work, buttons started falling off the radio so i got a JVC radion/cd player installed. The ride isnt bad, the car doesnt jar your neck when you hit a bump like my grandpaws 2010 mustang. I tell myself that i want a new car, but everytime i get in ""black stallion"" i say, what was i thinking, this is my baby. Gas millage isnt that bad either. "
"Love this car more than any I've ever owned  I am 58 years old with a chronic pain condition. I was getting pain in my hip and back because my old car was not ergonomic and I had started a new job that gave me a longer commute. I'm  a very practical person so I've stuck with Hondas and Toyotas most of my life. I decided to look for a new car, and my top concern was a comfortable, power adjustable seat. I test drove Honda, Toyota, VW, and Chevy.  Just for yucks I thought I'd stop by the Fiat dealer, which I passed every day on my way home.   The 500 was adorable but uncomfortable for me. The salesman suggested I look at the 500x and when I test drove it, it was the most comfortable seat I ever tried.  I had such a bias in my mind against Fiat that I didn't bother to discuss numbers, and went my merry way to try more Hondas, Toyotas, etc.  I couldn't get it out of my mind how comfortable the Fiat was, and I loved the look so I went back for a 2nd test drive. Sure enough, still the most comfy seat I had tried.  Turned out to be right in my price range. I've had it 2 months and still love it. Back pain is much better.  Everybody comments on my car and says they love it. A couple of drawbacks, though. When weather and engine are cold, acceleration is very sluggish.  Solution is to use remote start while walking to car, and let it run a couple of minutes before driving, but that does cut into mpg. Also, auto transmission upshifts at 2000 RPM instead of 2500, and hovers around 1500.  Sometimes it feels like engine is lugging, though it has never stalled.  I can live with those issues, all things considered. I think Fiat markets to young people but they should think about marketing to seniors, as this car is extremely easy to get in and out of, is not too low or high.  So many of the Hondas, Toyotas, etc. are downright UGLY this year with huge black grills and weird angles that make them look like a monster.  It's nice to have a car that's stylish and meets my practical needs at the same time.  I thought I hated driving because of my back pain. Now I love to drive.  Freeway mpg as high as 36 with no traffic."
"Better than i thought  After owning the 500X over a year I figured a review might help some people interested in the car. It's actually much better than most people give credit for. Fiat does indeed have some issues but most are for the 500 or 500L. The 500X is the only Fiat available in the US that's actually made in Italy, and shares the platform with the Jeep Renegade. I have the base model ""POP"" and actually very happy I got that one, the 6 speed manual gives a sporty feel and the little turbo 1.4L (same as in 500 Abarth) loves to rev, it sounds pretty cool too. The interior is much better even in the low end trim, the fabric is comfortable and it doesn't feel all cheap plastic inside like Honda,Hyundai etc. Make sure you Scothguard the fabric seats though they stain just from rain (but clean up well). I have had no problems yet at 10K miles, time will tell but all cars have problems at some point. If you're in the market for a small crossover it's worth a test drive and for the money the POP really has everything most people need in a daily driver (just get some nice aftermarket speakers/sub for the audio system)Update 12/12/17:Happy to report no issues at 22K miles. Still feels a solid buy and no rattles,squeaks or leaks.Fiat gets bashed a lot & maybe for good reason, but I’ve owned Toyota’s ,Honda’s, Fords and Mazda’s but never felt a connection to them like I do to my lil bambina! Those cars are good yes & so are many others, but they have no personality, no soul.You either want coffee or espresso."
"Mostly good, but some serious issues.  There are many things I love about this car, but I want to focus on the reasons why I am slightly regretting my purchase. The first is the terrible road noise at freeway speed, it's not bad if you have the radio on. But if you are talking to a passenger it can be a bit annoying, and taking a call on the Bluetooth system, don't even bother while going down the freeway because the person on the other line will just tell you that there is too much background noise to hear well. As for safety, I was really happy at the ratings it received. Unfortunately because of the pillar side airbags being so chunky, it leaves way too much blind area not just while making turns but can leave a pedestrian invisible at the pillar as you approach. To correct this I have to constantly move my head left and right to see around the pillar. I've never experienced so many close calls in any other car. And if you do have to break hard, get ready to veer left or right (that's part of the surprise, you don't get to know which direction it will take you). Even if you hold the steering wheel perfectly straight while moderately or heavily breaking you will veer sharply and there is nothing you can do to prevent it. Then we have the transmittion, it does not matter if it is in auto or semi-auto, it lags something terrible. Sometimes when you slow down and then begin to accelerate, it can take up to three seconds to react and downshift for any power at all. 4th and 5th gear changes are always clunky and late, leaving you to lurch about. If you are in auto and briefly (as in less than a seconds worth) press hard on the gas, it will down shift into second regardless of speed and take nearly half a minute to get back to the proper gear. This leaves you looking like a proper knob who is trying to race other drivers while you are at maximum revs. The final issue I have is that a warning light came on for the fab to be serviced (owning the car for only seven months). The dealership said that it needs an update and they would contact me in another month if it is available by then. In the meantime I get a pinging warning when I open the car door, start the car (which leaves a warning in place of the speed for 30 seconds annoyingly), when I turn off the car and again when I open my door to get out. And I have to deal with this obnoxious feature for at lease a month while they work on an update. I can't fanthom why in the world this is an issue in the first place."
"Great Car For The Price!!!  I was looking for a car after a deer totaled my beloved Prius.  Because we're moving to the country and it's West Virginia, an AWD was high on the list of must haves.  Went to the dealership intending to look at Imprezas.  When we got to the lot, we saw the 2 Imprezas on my list, and then noticed this little darling tucked in the corner with AWD on the windshield.  At first we both chuckled, then walked up for a closer look.  It was pretty much love at first sight!  The car is charming, both exterior and interior.  Got the keys, got in, and said, ""Wow, these seats are comfortable!""  Took it for a spin both in town and on the highway, and was pleasantly surprised at how nimble it is to drive, comfort was great, and speed -- let's just say this car has pickup!!  It was so smooth on the highway, my husband said, ""honey, you're going to have to watch your speed in this.""  Went back to the dealership to check out the Imprezas (since that's what we went for), sat in one and immediately got out.  Didn't even take it out of the parking spot.  Walked back in, asked for the Fiat 500x Easy keys back, and drove it home that day.  The drive home was 2 hours, and I loved every minute of it.  My husband drove it all the next while we ran errands and said if he was in the market for a car, he'd look for one for himself.  No, it doesn't get the same gas milage as the Prius, but Prius doesn't make an AWD, and that was more important to me this time.  Bought it used, 2016, 10,000 miles on it, not one scratch or stain -- perfect contdition.  I love love love this car!!!!  Give it a try, you won't regret it!!!!"
"Love it so far  Got a great offer on a lease with the 500X and I'm glad we took advantage of it. So far with a couple highway trips and a lot of downtown driving we are very hoppy with the car. The only complaint I can come up with is the way the trim levels are structured, but between the nice interior that is way more subtle and stylish than it's Jeep counterpart, the ease of driving, and the driving position in the vehicle we are very satisfied."
"I traded my Miata for this!  After owning my 500x Trekking Plus for over a year now I can say I love it even more.  Its served us well , we’ve gone on several road trips and even started a new biz with her. ( Online Antiques and a booth in Vero Beach )  Fiat is a great value.. and gets a bad rap, its connection to Mopar doesnt help. In a year of owning the car the only thing to fail was a Chrysler sourced MOPAR  design fan assembly that Fiat ( FCA ) took care of immediately.  Mopar fans have a long history of failures in many Dodge- Chrysler vehicles. But FCA is great. They told me it was imperative I get the car back into the dealer and  they had the car for three weeks  ( parts delay ) but they rented another car for me and I paid nothing .  My dealers customer service was above par.  So see my experience with my Fiat is that it’s been 100% reliable except for the American part that failed.   But she is back running better than ever and I have no complaints .  My original review contnues now.. Due to an unknown injury I came down with severe sciatica in my left leg and hip. My doctor said it was probably  exaserbated by twisting in and out of my low to the ground 2013 Mazda MX5. So I was on the hunt for something that was easy to get into. By far, and I have owned 25 cars now in my lifetime as a 55-year-old man, the  Fiat 500 X is the most comfortable car I have ever driven.  Plus after even after having Mercedes and BMWs I find it's electronics , infotainment system and build quality, superior. Fiat is right up there with Mazda in their top-of-the-line cars giving consumers the most bang for the buck you can possibly get for under 30,000. Even  a stripper Fiat comes with creature comfort's that you don't see another cars like  fully automatic headlamps.  Such a minor thing but a nicety none the less . My Fiat 500 X Trekking Plus is top-of-the-line and is only missing one option , the all-wheel-drive feature and the only reason I don't have it is because it's next to impossible to get in Florida for some reason.  None of the dealers are ordering it. But never mind, my car comforts me with the heated seats ,the leather,  cornering lamps  (by the way the cornering lambs are amazing, like personal luxury  cars of yesteryear) the dual pane panoramic sunroof, Beats stereo , navigation, back up cam, crash sonar, ...omg the list goes on...it's gonna probably take me two weeks to figure out how to operate every single feature this car has. And with all the geegaws comes a glass smooth ride with none of that herky-jerky transmission stuff that other people talk about, and the solid feel that you get when you shut a BMW door..that wonderful muffled thunk.   Plus, my dealer extends the warranty to 10 years 100'000 miles !  I think that Fiat is undervalued and this car is a game changer for the Fiat brand in America.I want to address some of the bad reviews this car gets.  In reading them, I find the people who write negative comments about the cars transmission, hesitation, etc are probably bad drivers, or have expectations that could not be met by a crossover.   In owning my car and having driven several others in its class , the Fiat 500x offers the best value.  For instance , the 500x Trekking Plus has a power seat, the Mazda CX3 doesn't. It's not available. The CX3 gets praise from auto journalists, but it's based on the old Mazda 2 which was a dog and sold poorly.  So much for objectivity, the Mazda 2 has been dropped. .  Also ,to write a review based on simply driving a rental, should not be alllowed!  Rental cars get beat to Hades and back.  The 500x takes getting used to. I had to learn how the electric parking brake works, it's not the most intuitive thing. But the 500x truly  is a fun, well built rig."
"Feel very happy about this purchase!  The 500x wasn't my first choice. After carefully reading all the reviews about all the cars, I was torn between the Subaru Crosstrek and the 500x. It wasn't until I went for a test drive that pushed me over the edge. Sitting inside the 500x felt solid, comfortable, designed, and well thought out. Sitting inside the Crosstrek felt cheap and unrefined. This is with regards to the interior design. The drivability of the Subaru Crosstrek admittedly felt better. The gear system on the Subaru was smoother and lighter. Suspension felt supple. The 500x I test drove was a bit stiff, steering felt tight, but didn't hear the exaggerated loud cabin everyone complained about. I also didn't sense the jerky transmission. Perhaps it had been reprogrammed already. I purchased the car in Sep. 2016 and those issues have been addressed. My previous cars have been a 1998 VW Jetta, 2003 Audi A4, 2006 Honda Element, and most recently the 2013 Fiat 500e. I chose the 500x due to the extra incentive for being a return Fiat customer. Plus, the rebate, plus the dealer discount for end-of-year sale. The savings added up and it became a no-brainer to go with the 500x. The reviews had been so bad, that I really felt I made a compromise for the money saved. But so far, things have been great and all the claims had been unfounded. I find the handling of the 500x to be amazing. After I drop the kids off at school I take a longer drive through the hills of Los Gatos because the car is so fun to drive. I have also driven up steep hills and pushed the limits around corners and have yet to feel out of control. The acceleration is average, not as responsive as the electric 500e or the Audi 1.8T. I suppose that's comparing apples to oranges. I sat in the back of both Crosstrek and 500x and the differences were unnoticeable. They were both pretty snug with just enough leg room for somebody 5'8"". I do think that the 500x has a smaller trunk than the Crosstrek. Long story short, I don't feel I compromised just to get the better price. Side by side, if the prices were the same for the Crosstrek and the 500x, I'd still choose the 500x. It just has more personality and much nicer to look at. We'll have to see what the long term reliability holds up. But I'm comforted with a 48k/ 5 year bumper to bumper warranty."
"X Marks the Spot!  Let me start by stating that this is my 4th FIAT purchase consecutively.  I have owned 3 cabrio 500's including the Abarth!  In my opinion, you don't purchase a FIAT because it's more dependable than a Honda or because it has a better resale value than a Toyota.  FIAT ownership is about discernment for a stylish automobile.  It's about passion.  Driving with pride of ownership -- as opposed to those who buy a car to get them ""from point 'A' to point 'B'"".  The FIAT 500x is a vehicle that you WANT to drive.  I wait anxiously for the end of my work day so I can get to the reward... driving my Italian automobile."
"So Far So Good  Only had our 500X AWD for a month, but it seems to handle the curves in the mountains of NC/TN very well. Also the AWD seems to handle the rain better than our FWD Corolla. Notice some reviews complain on the shifting, my experience switch to ""sport"" when you know you need more responsive shifting. Works for us. Not really comfortable front seats but for a compact SUV I can live with it. Only real complaint is the factory navigation and trying to find an update for it online. Google maps very up to date but would like NAV to be updated so I can leave phone alone totally and use factory hands free. Look forward to this fall/winter to see how the AWD holds up."
"Love my 500X  I love my car. I drove several different cross-overs and loved this one. I asked for a longer factory warranty and got it--89 months/100,000 miles. I have had no problems with my car and drive it daily.Update: I still love my car. In over a year the only thing it has needed was an oil change. It got me through snow during the winter, pouring rain in the PNW, and to work every day."
"Great car People think its v8 LOL  I bought this car for wife for her first car on valenitnes day! Sunburst gold metallic clearcoat. Beautiful car. It has k&N CAI and Flowmaster Dual exhaust and rear end gear gear has been changed. solid car goes like hell and reliable real headturner. Really liked it when my wife showed up 79 camaro show car with 15000 grand in motor while he was showboating with his wife. He could barely keep up and we were just toying. Ford Rocks. Just bought new supercrew Great truck got rid of dakota, don't but. Chrysler is crap. Chevy is ok just need more balls.Peace"
"Gets a lot of attention!  This car is actually fun to drive, and it gets a lot of attention, with people pointing at it!  It's pretty roomy in the front. The back is so-so. Great for kids or smaller people. I bought the 2.4 AWD. It hugs the road nicely. The auto shifting is a bit rough. It takes some time getting used to. The stereo rocks, and there are USB ports. It was very easy to sync the phone. The middle screen on the dash has a lot of computer ""stuff"" that you can program. IE-Alerts you when you are going a certain speed that you have set, outside temp, miles to empty etc. Plus you can have it show digitally MPH (The speedometer to the left of that screen actually is the ""old school"" 20, 30, 40 etc with the lines for each 5MPH increment. All in all I give it a 4. I would give it a 5, but it's a bit slow pulling into traffic. It doesn't ""lag"", however. It slowly but steadily increases in speed. It's a quiet ride, and once you hit 70+ MPH it's very smooth. I like it! THUMBS UP."
the Fiat 500X is better car than my last 8 cars.  
"Unfortunate issues  I owned the Fiat 500 L, which was totalled, and I walked away from the crash, so for that, I was thankful. I had many issues with my car, but for the price and accessories, I considered the 500 X. I had it as my rental car. It already had issues with only 4000 miles on it. The engine was hiccup ping already and some back up camera issues were already there. I had to have my backup camera replaced at 15000 miles and had already changed my brakes at 20000. Hope this helps."
"6 months and still love it  Leased the due to reliability concerns bit so far, no problems.  Love the styling.  The optional two tone dash and seats are awesome - retro feel and fun.  Only con is gas mileage.  City driver here and averaging 20mpg.  Would 3xpect much better from a new car but pros offset this"
"Fun little SUV  I thoroughly enjoyed driving Fiat 500X during a recent trip in spite of trying my friend's Mazda 3 (rental again) during the same period. I liked - free revving engine/confidence inspiring handling/steering etc. Not so liked - interior space (as expected), a little jerky transmission at times on some mode.Please find the video I shot during the trip - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ8pY-3twms. My reliability rating is of course based on my rental period - the car almost had 20000 miles in it and was as good as new except for few scratches both inside and out (unlike a regular Fiat 500 I rented some time back which had a broken seat folding liver and couple of loose parts at around 45000 miles)."
"I Love My Baby!!  I saw an ad on this car early last year, and I immediately fell in love. First I was bummed because it wasn't going to be out for a few more months. Finally it came out.... Yay!! I took it out for a few test drives, waited for some people to buy it and put out reviews, which took forever and still there's hardly any out there. I was scared  because not too many reviews and the ones that were out there were not that good. I've always owned Honda's, so I was hesitating, test driving other vehicles. I tried the Honda HRV, seemed very cheap to me. So I kept searching the inventory for my little fiat, I wanted a white lounge model with black leather seats and a sunroof, they had them within 50 miles of me, but by the time I got more serious about finally going and getting it of course they didn't have any within 200 miles of me that had the sunroof... So mine doesn't have the sunroof, but that's ok, I was kind of worried about the mesh that's up there any ways, because the sunlight comes in the car a little too much, the lady I spoke to at one the dealer's said you could tint the sunroof, but I also thought that the mesh will eventually deteriorate......Anyhow I got a fantastic deal on mine.... And I Love, Love, Love it!! I think I will name it Marshmallow, My 20 year old daughter's idea. I've had my baby since February and I haven't had any real issues with it. The one thing is when you lock the doors with the button outside, sometimes you have to press it a few times. The transmission is a little tetchy and not real quick off the line, that's ok I guess, Fewer tickets... I was worried it wouldn't get up hills very good, but it does just fine.  The seats are super comfortable. And like another reviewer mentioned is the cool gas cap, there isn't one, yay! You just open the door and boom, you stick the nozzle in and you can't just stick any thing in there either, so you don't have to worry people will still your gas..... I was on the fence about this car (even though I really wanted it) I was worried because it's a Fiat and not a Honda, but now everyday I go outside and see my little baby, I'm so glad I got it."
"Fun and Luxury in the Same Package  I have owned my FIAT 500X for almost 7000 miles, and I could not be happier with my decision.  I had narrowed my choices down to the Honda CRV, Kia Sportage, and the 500X.  Each vehicle had a nice ride and good acceleration, and also had its particular strong points.  For instance, the CRV-EX had several cool features (sunroof, lane watch, etc.) and got the best gas mileage.  The Sportage had a nice interior and the largest back seats and cargo area.  The FIAT was the most comfortable and looked great inside and out; I would compare the interior to a luxury SUV, but for half the price.  I briefly looked at the Mini Countryman S, but I did not want to pay for a turbo charger (just one more expensive item to break) to get an adequate amount of power.  I read many reviews (Edmunds and elsewhere) that gave the FIAT negative marks for their transmission and their acceleration.  I will say that I needed to get used to the gas pedal, it is different from any other car I have driven.  Once I figured out how to press the pedal (I know it sounds crazy, but give it a week or so), my driving experience became much more enjoyable.  That was when I no longer experienced the “jerkiness” that many of the reviews had mentioned.  Instead, I found that the silky smooth transmission shifts quicker than other cars, and it is even more fun to drive in the “Sport” mode.  The engine is really strong and quiet, and the ride is smooth and quiet at highway speeds.  More importantly, passing at highway speeds is very easy.  I have not experienced any of the hesitation that other reviewers have mentioned, and most of the time I am at or over the speed limit much quicker than I expect.  Gas mileage has been good but not great at 28 MPG, but this is a very small price to pay for such a nice car.  In addition to the engine and transmission, I cannot say enough good things about the interior and the technology.  It has higher ground clearance, so I can get in and out of it very easily.  The seats and the dash layout really feel like they came out of a much more expensive European luxury SUV.  I did not get all of the “bells and whistles” on my model, but I did want the options that are made to keep me and my family safe.  The one I use most often is the “Rear Cross Path Detection” that informs me about unseen vehicles approaching from the side when backing out of a parking space.  Very nice.The FIAT 500X really has made my commute more fun and enjoyable, and I never thought I would say that about a vehicle."
"Great first car  I got a Fiat 500X Lounge fully equipped just a couple of weeks ago. You can consider that this review comes from someone owning a car for the first time; I used to drive occasionally and rely on public transportation. This year I decided to have a car for a life style change, and researched many options similar to my Fiat 500X: Mazda X3, Nissan Juke, Audi Q3 (this one was way above the price I planned to pay for a car). Turns out that the Fiat 500X was an excellent choice! The car is a bit small, although I was not looking for big SUVs anyway, but access in the front seat is a little tight. Fuel economy was a bit of disappointment, I only got 13.5 MPG so far but I guess I mostly drive in the city, and that is why. The car is very artsy and extremely beautiful, the final touching in styling is impeccable and really beautiful, and the car stands out in the crowd. It is a very fast, comfortable car, I used to share driving a Prius and several Mazdas, and have to say that, for a car that is not as spacious, the Fiat 500X is very comfortable and roomy. The panoramic sunroof is very pretty from outside, and functional, easy to use from inside. Commands and controls on dashboard as very simple, and the car has a tech/vintage quality that goes very well all together. It is very, very pretty! I am not commenting on repair record yet (hopefully I will take some time before this), and the only disappointment is the fuel consumption in the city. Otherwise, it is just a very stylish, functional, fun, fast car. One hundred percent charming!"
"Manual Makes it Better!!!  Ok...so I had an Abarth...Manual...w 5 speed. But we're having a child soon so I had to trade in w 500x Manual. It comes with 6 speed. Boy ...it shifts better. Smooth.  Often I missed my Abarth Exhaust notes. But I'm  starting to like this 500x because even though it's the same engine, 6 speed is a lot better for both cars. Clutch is really easy to shift...it is never a chores. I was never a Fiat fun till now. Big Trunk, lots of room interior and driver seat is also comfy. I wish they put CD player. Man i miss it too. Saves gas also even though it runs premium but hey if put 70mph on cruise, you'll get like 32mpg at least. So yes..if you want manual, roomy, big trunk this is the one for you."
"Weeks of research led me to this great decision  After my wife and I (and eventually our two teenagers) shared a VW Beetle for 12 years, we wanted to get a new car.  I researched the VW Beetle turbo, which I loved but my wife wanted a four door. Drove the VW GTI which I also loved but that's a cramped racer, we needed more room. Seriously considered a Nissan Juke AWD (turbo) -- the Nissan has excellent power but it's got small cargo capacity and most of all the Nissan has a loud cabin at highway speeds. Tried out a Subaru XV (good cargo capacity but lousy power) and a Subaru Forester (so ugly, and too large), and VW GTI.  I kept coming back to the Fiat 500x, test drove one on three different occasions.  Here's why I chose the Fiat, and what I think of the car after driving it for just three days.You get a quiet ride with the 500x, at 80 MPH the car just floats along like a luxury car.  Quieter than the Subaru XV, the 500x also holds the road like a substantial vehicle whereas the XV seems more like a lightweight.  The 500x is so much quieter than the Juke, you can hardly compare them (though the Juke has turbo and pulls with greater power).Styling of the 500x (Trekking) is superior, and it grows on you.  Every time I look at the 500x I like it more!Seats are comfortable on long distance drives.  I made one 500 mile trip the day after purchase, and I fit right in to the seats.  My 500x has manual, non-heated, fabric seats.  I like the brown leather upgraded seats offered, but didn't want to pay the high price for the options package that includes them.I have also tested the AWD function, as we had a freak rain storm yesterday.  You turn the dial to traction mode and it really works.  You can view the wheel spin percentages for each wheel on your dash, but choosing that option with the steering wheel controls.  I don't know how this technology has been developed but it seems very sophisticated.  All of this for a brand new car I bought for about $23,000.  What a great value.  Thank you Fiat.Update January 2018 — 32,000 miles on the car and it still looks and drIves great. Zero problems."
"Built Ford tough  This Mustang is my 4th and I love it. The 5 spd tranny shifts smoothly, and the 4.6L engine has plenty of GITTYUP and GO. I get around 22-23 MPG on the highway. The exhaust sound is awesome. The Mach stereo system is OK and the instrument cluster is easy to read and watch. the leather interior is very comfortable and being 6'2"" and 225 lbs, I have plenty of room in the drivers and passenger seats. I do not have room in the back even if the seats are moved forward, but I did not buy it to carry people around. I bought it for the PERFORMANCE. I have had camaros and trans ams, and the Mustang is my favorite. Plenty of aftermarket parts, so your bank account won't go empty if a repair pops up. "
"More than the sum of its parts  The market for compact/subcompact crossovers is not crowded, but there are plenty of options. I researched Hondas, Mazdas, Nissans, Kias and Buicks (online, in-person, test driving) before deciding on a Fiat 500X. It was a difficult decision because I was looking for a previously owned vehicle, but 2016 is the first model year of the the 500X. After four months, I got lucky and found a discounted demo that was fully loaded and haven't looked back. The transmission is... quirky. It took me a couple of weeks to find the balance between hesitancy and jackrabbit starts. I had to actively be the one to decide because the car couldn't really do it (and still can't). Braking at low speeds is touchy - again, until one acclimates oneself to the system. Nonetheless, I am still thrilled by the nimbleness of the X. When I need to pass at highway speeds, I have to do little more than think it and it's done. The entertainment/communications/navigation/electronic control panel is everything it should be. The ride is firm, but real issues in the road (e.g., railroad tracks, speed bumps) are handled with alacrity. After a month, I still wake up thrilled to get behind the wheel. So much style, so much fun.Update:Our relationship is now celebrating its half-year anniversary, and we are still honeymooning. We have just experienced our first significant frozen precipitation event, and my baby sat it out in the driveway. I do not drive on ice. That is not why I bought the car. The X handles the narrow, twisting, hilly roads of my neighborhood with aplomb even in normal driving mode when there is no ice, and that is all that I ask.One-year Update:Now that I have owned the car for a year, I have to say that I did not appreciate the significant decline in value of the car. In one year, the value has declined by one-third. Otherwise, I'm still satisfied."
"This would be a good car, if it had a good engine!  The 500X is a nice little SUV, with many fine attributes.  Unfortunately, it is hobbled by a sluggish engine and transmission.  The engine and transmission look impressive on paper, with 180 HP and 9 speeds.  But, they fail to deliver.  My rental, with only 8000 miles on it, had a bad tendency to hesitate at the worst possible times. Even when the hesitating was not pronounced, there was a noticeable delay between pressing the gas pedal and the car moving.  The engine has no torque below 2500 RPM.   I experimented with manual shifting and then flooring the accelerator. Below 2500, the engine was weak. Passing situations, where you may be at 45 MPH and want to move in the passing lane with traffic rapidly approaching from the rear, were unnerving.  It seems like an eternity before the transmission downshifts, and the engine builds enough torque to accelerate the car.  The Sport mode works by holding the RPM's about 1000 higher, but it did not improve the performance much.  Generally, the acceleration was either ""too little"", or ""too much"", and rarely ""just right"".  I tried moderately accelerating, but the transmission quickly goes into a higher gear, making the accelerating sluggish.  Trying to accelerate only slightly faster resulted in abrupt downshifts, and the engine racing towards its red line.  This gives other drivers the impression that you are trying to race them, when you are only trying to get reasonable acceleration out of it. An auto magazine found that the smaller engine and manual transmission was actually faster than the larger engine and automatic.  This does not surprise me. Other reviews have mentioned the balky transmission, so I don't believe that my car was an isolated case.  I am not sure about the hesitation. that is unusual in a modern car.  Driving in mountainous areas was a chore, and manual shifting worked best.   But there is little engine braking below 4000 RPM, so going down 8 percent grades was a noisy affair. I will leave the other details about the car to other reviewers.  First, see if you are going to be happy with the engine and transmission, and then look at the rest of the car's features."
"E in Everett loves this baby SUV!  After test driving everything in this class, and I mean everything, nothing compared to the 500X. Excellent quality, great value, and it fits like a glove. I read the reviews about it being crammed and the whining about the way it shifts. I'm 5' nothing so I have no issues with room. Power delivery is very smooth and more than enough for this class. Very comfortable both in town and on the freeway. I'm not worried about reliability. I also own a 500C and have never had any issues with it. Fiat may not be popular and that's fine with me. I get to drive something I love and not see 20 of them in the parking lot everywhere I go. I'm also getting great mileage to boot :)"
"One of the best decisions ever  My Fiat 500x has been named Bambino.  Awesome drive, great shifting, acceleration (especially sport mode).  I wish they had put a/c vents in the rear and a spare tire.  But beyond that, the faux leather is amazing, the sound system is great, the gas mileage is so-so, but you'll love this vehicle.  The trunk is split so you have reserved space, the rear seats are roomy (I have three kids back there everyday).  We sold our Sienna for this vehicle and NO REGRETS.  It never feels like its dying during acceleration and its terribly unique and adorable.  The sun roofs are lovely, and the technology is perfect (USB, AUX, SATELLITE- no cd). I've read reviews where they say the car feels like it can't find the right gear, that is total nonsense, the moment you own your vehicle you figure out the gears and how they feel, 9 speed-it does what it's supposed too.  I tried MANY brands (for months) before taking Bambino and I almost bought another vehicle.  I feel blessed I tried Fiat.  After two test drives the same day...I was sold! Definitely an underdog.  Deserves hand washes and premium."
"The Fiat that could  got this fiat 500x  on Feb 24 2016   it seams to be a good little SUV .   so far NO problems.   have about 2500 miles on it now.it rides good ,  easy to get in and out since it doesn't sit low  .   I liked the style of it  have been asked several times about it when getting gas and things.I was used to a subura crosstrak  but after a wreck  couldnt afford another subura .  this is almost the same .I traded the car in Aug2016 got other crosstrak  as I do miss the fiat .  I didn't have problems  with the car , the value wasn't there . yes I would say get one but yet again  its up the person.  I like suburas .  Sorry Fiat .   dealership is closer and where I go theres subura dealerships in MT ."
"FOOL ME 1X SHAME ON YOU FOOL ME 2XA SHAME ON ME  Where should I begin? I purchased a FIAT 500L in 2012. The car was a disaster. I took it to the dealership many times. The last thing that did was to stop in the middle of the highway. When I brought it for service. Guess what had happened? the clutch BURNED. BURNED!!!! YES. Brand new car and the clutch burned. I freaked out in the middle of the highway. I had to get out and the next day I took it immediately to Rick Case FIAT. They had to give me a rental because the car was unsafe to drive. Well.. maybe I should've thought about it more carefully, but I loved the look of the FIAT so much that I decided to get a new FIAT instead. Because the other one ... well you know what happened. The clutch BURNED. So I decided to lease a 500X thinking it was a ""much better"" version of the old one and thinking this one was not going to have any problems at all. Well....WRONG! I leased this car on September of 2015. I had taken this car about 5-6 times already. The last 3 times for the same exact reason. The car is simply unsafe to drive. I do not feel safe in that car. I am scared of driving it and for something bad to happen to me. I will NEVER purchase a FIAT EVER again. I am so disappointed, upset, and simply can't believe how awful my experience has been with FIAT."
Almost 3 years with the Fiat 500x  We have owned the car for almost 3 years and have had no major problems with the car.  We have gone through several dealerships in Dallas as one closed and a new one opened up.  They have done a good job for the scheduled maintenance and have taken care of all of its needs.  I upgraded with door sill covers and the spare tire kit.  I highly recommend those items.  Thanks FIAT!  We love our European crossover.
"I had to give a car a name!  For the first time ever, I had to give a car a name. Meet Donatella who sat in the showroom with the shiny white and chrome finish, the huge sunroof open to let the light show off the tobacco leather interior and then the moves of the effortless 2.5L and taught starring and ride sold me. However, that same day in a quad-fecta of Midtown Manhattan, I drove and bargained for the Q3, X1, Countryman, 500X and then before buying the next day, I threw in the ringer of the HR-V. Over some tense deliberations at Dunkin Donughts, the spouse and I agreed to throw out logic and get the Fiat. Yes, we've been back to the dealer for squeaky breaks and a blown fuse for the locks,  but Fiat of Manhattan has been nothing but professional and accomodating with walk-in Saturday service. I've enjoyed nice lunches in Midtown and walks in Central Park and I knew very well that except for the HR-V, we'd see the dealer again.I've never had a car that got so many looks. We are often pointed out as being the ""blue pill car"", people look at it in passing and point, take pictures. I'm a star at the Whole Foods parking lot. I got followed to another gourmet food place in Redhook by a lady who came up to tell me she knew to follow the Fiat as that type of car would know where to go. The guy at my local car wash asked if the interior was custom! For particulars, I find the transmission unnoticeable for the most part. When I want to notice, I'm rather impressed with the execution but do thing it's a little over the top for such a vehicle. The engine is smooth, smooth, smooth and pleanty powerful. Donatella does like to drink in the city at 19mpg but does take it easy on the N.J. Turnpike at 30mpg with cruise mostly set at 75, um 79mph. Uconnct works very well and so much easier than the BMW/Mini system as it shows as much love for my Android as it does for my Apple phones. The dog seems happy with the back seat. The sunroof is a huge favorite and the fixed glass part over the back seat opens that space up tremendously compared to all but the X1. I feel for the previous reviewers on here. I knew going into a new build from two manufacturers not know for reliability that there would be issues, but that was the same for BMW/Mini and Audi. I read up on the USA 500xmweb forum and most known issues have bulletins on the faults. I randomly joined an Italian FB group and they go bonkers over the car but also have some similar issues. I don't need a daily driver and honestly, if the dealer keeps it overnight for some time, I'd just take the subway home and not have to worry about parking. I'd not recommend anything but a Honda/Mazda/Kia/Toyota as a daily driver but I've had those too over the years and frankly, I'm really enjoying the sense of occasion I'm getting with the Fiat. I just really enjoy Donatella's company, even when she's having an off day.Update:We just past 13000 miles and 1yr of ownership and that's more miles I've out on a car in a year that my last three. That may not sound like much but I fly for a living and live in NYC so I rarely put more than 9000 miles a year on a car. I still get the looks, friends new and old still complement the car and are even surprised it's a Fiat. More importantly, I simply like getting in it and driving it. I've had a few rental SUV's lately and although they had their strengths, getting back in the Fiat 500x at the end of a trip just shows me the sense of occasion few other products offer.That said, the 9-spd auto is still a work in progress but sometimes just works a treat and sometimes just reminds you a lot is going on. It is never rude but perhaps not always in the background. The locks blew a fuse and was fixed right away on a Saturday afternoon dealer service visit while I went for a coffee. We only had one big snow fall this past winter and at 31"" in one night, I don't care what you have, dig your own car out. We left the Fiat covered for over a week. Other than that, we love the sunroof, the heated seats and steering wheel, the remote start and the UConnect with SIRI. The sporty exhaust along with the sometimes and surprisingly sporty down and up shifts remind you someone with a soul added a bit to the car. With my yearly mileage, fuel economy isn't a real deal for me with class leading to class last equaling about $200 a year when figured with $4.00/gallon fuel. Thus, and I just checked this, we averaged 20mpg even with 5800 miles at an average speed of 17mph. 80mph turnpike runs show 28mpg and more docile 70mph runs show 32mpg. Highway mpg is competitive but city mpg is really at the bottom and both are dissapointing considering the challenged 9-speed auto. I'm a happy owner and I think the character of the Fiat will keep me that way even if something nefarious comes up in the future.UPDATE: At just under 16000 miles and 1-1/2 years with the 500x, the enjoyment of the Fiat is complemented via no maintenance visits in the last year. Loving the Fiat!"
"Biggest regret  I purchased my first car on October 26th, 2015 this car was a fiat 500x. I left the dealership from which I purchased said car at around 8:30pm the following day at noon said car stalled and began smoking, then the Electric E-Brake turned on so I could not physically move it from the street shortly followed by the steering wheel completely locked up (the car had 81 miles on it), it took two hours for the tow truck to arrive to remove the car. It took two days for the dealer it was sent to to get back to me (which put me well past my return within 48 hours policy) at which time they said that the car had parts of the engine lying at the base of the compartment, this was not true the formal report stated that a rod shot through the engine, I was informed that there was a physical hole in the engine when more parts were needed as an excuse as to why I was without my car. They informed me they needed to order a NEW ENGINE to put in my new car, which took 2 weeks to arrive because they decided to let it come in on the next shipment of parts, after the engines arrival it took a week to have the engine put in (I was told when they said the engine needed to be replaced that it would take a MAXIMUM of 3 days to put in once it arrived) After the engine was in they tested the car to see if all was in working order it was not, a new fuse and starter would have to be ordered to make the car run, receiving and putting in said new pieces took a week and a half (at this point I was at a new car that I had in my possession for less that 24 hours had hit the 30th day in the shop mark)  once the new pieces were all in they tested to see if all was in working order once again it was however while giving it a thorough test-drive they noticed stalling on turns. Turned out that a new air intake valve was needed this added a little less than a full week to my already 4 weeks and 3 days in the shop for a problem that a new car should not be having. FINALLY I got the call on December 4th 2015 that my car was ready to be picked up, when I went to get my car the employees of the dealership this car was sent to stressed how thankful they were with my being so understanding of the whole situation. Throughout the entirety of this lengthy process the woman I was dealing with at the dealership rarely called me to let me know any update I was more often then not calling repeatedly to hear anything, I probably called the dealership 30 times and they called me of their own accord without my harassing at most 5. Disgusted with the company. I at one point was so tired that I called the state representative on Saturday November 21st, who said he would give me a call the following Monday regarding getting me a refund. I have yet to hear anything from him or anyone under him to this day. The only kind thing was the dealership from which I bought this car called a couple times to make sure the car was running fine after its return to me. Would never recommend to anyone!"
"Don't waste your time or money  We were excited to be the first 500X owners in our town. We showed this car off to all our friends and family. A month after purchase, the car started shifting very firm and overheated. After going to the dealer, I was told that there was water in the oil ( telling me that a head was cracked or a seal was bad) we got the car back the next day and was told everything was fine. No notes on the paperwork about water being in the oil. Assuming everything was fine, we took the car back. A week later the car would stall during hard braking or hard acceleration. Today while picking my daughter up from a friends house, the car stalled and would not start for over 2 hours. No help from dealership on this matter as of yet. It could be our car, but after reading other reviews I don't think we're alone in this matter."
"No problems that wernt expected  I bought this car in 2000 and I have driven it in my work for the last 10 years. Had to repair the transmission at 125,000 miles changes brakes, shocks and oil. Put on a duel exhaust and an h pipe did a couple of tune up and the car has 342,425 miles on it. Engine runs very good does not burn oil and always starts up when called for. Body is showing some signs of wear and will need body work this year. I love the car and would not think of getting rid of it. Has the usual mechanical problems of any car with that many miles on it but I just love driving it. If I ever had to replace it I would look for another the same style and year"
Love it or leave it.  After 2 years and 58 k miles the car stillHolds very wellJust got 4 Pirelli sotto zero winter tires and they are the best even in the summerMy car does not have LED lights and that is a problem when it rains and you travel on remote highwaysVisibility is very poor Otherwise the lights are okAt night if is not rainingI am waiting to see if they will bring outA 7 seaterIf not I will upgrade to an Alfa Romeo Stelvio
Don't bother!  Stay away from this car!  FCA had to buy it back as the BCM (Body control module) could not be programmed.  Was a headache dealing with FCA.. Horrible customer service..  I will never purchase ANY vehicle that falls under the title or umbrella of FCA.  DO NOT waste your money!
Best build fiat  
"Beware...  Purchased this Fiat 500X Trek, several weeks ago. I experienced my first breakdown, halfway, during my one hour drive home from the dealer. It shut off at 40 mph, and was difficult to start afterwards. Was instructed by my salesperson to take it to the service department the very next day, which I did, with the engine light on for the entire trip. They read the onboard diagnostic. The service tech expained that the computer was reading fault codes and self correcting as it learns. This conclusion set uneasy with me, but I was inclined to take my service manager's advise. Was sent out the door with instructions to return if any further problems. This very same day, I made it half way home, when I stopped for a soda. Upon attempting to restart my vehicle, it would not start. After several attempts of starting the moter, I called the service dept back to report my problem, but was only able to leave a message. After waiting 20 minutes for thier call back, I again attempted to start the motor, and was successfull. Engine light was on however, and it seems to be running out of tune, with little power. The service department finally returned my call, and instructed me to return the vehicle again, which I did the very next day. And was awarded a rental car.After about 8 days, I was advised that my Fiat had a new onboard body computer module installed, and that it was fine and ready for pick up. I finally made my first successful trip home with this car. However, the very next day, The vehicle became difficult to start, and remained in 3rd gear at all times, with the engine light on. So, again, another call to the service department, and I was advised to have the vehicle towed, which I did with the assistance of the Fiat Roadside Assistance, and a local towing service, and was awarded another rental vehicle.After several days, I was advised that there was a loose/corroded ground wire on the side of my transmission, which was repared, and my vehicle was ready for pick up. Once again, I picked up my vehicle, and did make a successful trip home. However... the very next day, having driven about 30 miles, the vehicle shut off while driving at about 25 mph. I did finally restart, but stayed in 3rd gear at all times, and showed an engine light on. I pulled off the road again, and called the service department. There were several attempts at reaching them on this occassion. And my family and I found ourselves stranded for some significant period of time. After a long period of time, the vehicle restarted, engine light did stay on, however it was switching through the automatic gears successfully, so I limped the car back home. Once again, another rental vehicle and yet another tow sevice back to the service department, where my vehicle sits at this time. To summerize, my vehicle has been in service 4 times in as many weeks, remains there to date, has less than 500 miles, all of them being to the service department and back. I have serveral hundred dollars tied up in rental car deposits, and am very disappointed. The most distressing thing is shutting down while in motion. I find this to be very dangerous under some driving and traffic conditions. I will on Monday, ask this Fiat dealer to buy back my car. It is my hope that this car is the ""lemon:, and not the entire model. As I do really like this line up of cars, I am sure my dealer could satifactory place me in another like and kind of Fiat, 500X AWD, and look forward to that discussion.Just saying...beware.Okay, 2 years later. After a very hard and lengthy bout with Chrysler Fiat, my Fiat was determined to be a ""lemon"", and was replaced. It's been a couple years in my new Fiat. At this time, this new 500x continues to run strong, with regular maintenance as oil changes, etc... Only complaint I have at this time, would be the trim of the vehicle. It's all glued from factory, and has been coming off all around the car. That would be the rubber and chrome strips and moldings. Leaving a very sticking substance underneath that seams to get on everything. Clothes, hands, the dog. Very annoying, and ugly looking.But hey, it starts and goes. Would not purchase another one though. Good Luck."
"The more-than-adequate compact crossover from Fiat  This is a compact version of your average American crossover, with enough horsepower, traction and capability to do almost everything you need it to do, and not a bit extra.  It won't tow your heavy equipment or move much of your furniture, but in Pop form, with the turbocharged multi-air four and six speed manual, it will get down the road nicely.  Put some good snow tires on its steel wheels and you will get where you are going through considerable snowfall.  The seats are comfortable, but rear seat passengers will be crowded.  Handling is really quite good, though my Fiat 500 Pop would run circles around it, and the 500X could easily be called ""quick,"" but not fast.  Note that the six speed manual makes all the difference in this model Fiat, though the option sacrifices you will have to make to row your own gears are substantial.  It seems that Fiat jumped on the manual-because-we-must bandwagon and the 1.4L 6MT is basic in most areas.  They saved the really good stuff for the Easy and Trekking versions.  No matter, the Pop 1.4L 6MT is a hoot to drive, has good road manners, decent acceleration with the turbocharger and a healthy lack of infotainment bells and whistles.  I do wish accessories were more reasonably priced and the 1.4L multi-air engine didn't eat premium gas, but there is much to like and no complaints so far.  Still no complaints after 4750 miles.  Dealership fixed a cruise control issue under warranty, and while it did take a while, they gave me a loaner (500L).  Did my own oil change recently and it's much easier than my Fiat 500 Pop.  Still like the car after six months!UPDATE:  After nine months of ownership the Fiat 500X was involved in a car/deer collision, sustained substantial damage to the front, and was a total loss.  The airbags worked as designed, though the knee airbag left a palm sized bruise on my right leg and the passenger airbag (seat was unoccupied) broke the windshield.  Lost substantial money to depreciation, though my insurance company was completely transparent and efficient throughout.  I replaced the Fiat 500X with a 2014 Ford C-Max Energi that I like very much.UPDATE:  After four years of ownership I traded my Fiat 500 in on the Ford C-Max above and now have zero Fiats in my garage.  I am living happily ever after.  Would I buy another Fiat?  No.  FCA will always be the quirky Italian cousin everyone talks about, but nobody takes seriously.  That is a shame."
"The 500X never stops disappointing  Its been about 6 months with my 500X and there's not a day that goes by that I regret the decision to buy it.I had a few problems once I first bought the car and was received poorly at my Fiat agency and Fiat USA. Ther was never any acknowledgement of the problems (shiftiness, tire screeching, electronic malfunction), instead they just assured me everything was ok. Well it's month six and those problems, sans the electronic, are still there. Add a horrible, annoying and constant rattling from both doors and that's what I put up with daily. I regret not buying a Mazda or Honda."
"No not the tiny Fiat, the NEW Fiat with AWD!  Pro's:Very stylish! ( A cross between a Mini Cooper and a CRV)All Wheel Drive at a good starting price (around $24K)Easy to drive and easy to parkSmall, but not too small.Gas efficientKeyless entry and remote startCon's:Issues with the VIN#'s, resulted in me having a hard time insuring the Car.  It would have been nice if the dealership told me about this known issue before I drove off the lot!!!  I was only able to find one insurer for my new car, which means I didn't get the best rate.  I went back to the dealership and they provided me with a VIN # verification form- hopefully that does the trick.  They slipped a piece of paper in my car, with information about the issue when I bought the car. Again, it would have been nice if they addressed the issue up front.I leased the car and the dealer didn't really go over what maintenance is covered under the warranty/lease. Where as we just leased a Toyota for my husband and they scheduled the first oil change in 6 months before we even left the dealership. Back seat is just large enough for passengers, but I imagine somebody 6' tall would have issues back there.Overall, I'm very happy with the car so far."
Fiat pop  Initial quality and overall performance of car is excellent. Ride and appeal much better than expected. Truly a fun car to drive and very functional.
"Hot  What I love. Well just look at the car! So stylish. I had been driving a 2013 Subaru Crosstrek. I love that this is even a little more compact and that there are so few on the road. Performance probably not as good.  Subaru AWD can't be beat, and the Subaru flat 4 has a lower center of gravity. Ground clearance on the 500X is same as Crosstrek, very good. Seats ride higher on the 500X even though the heights of the vehicles are the same, so better road visibility. 5'11"" or taller is a problem in the back if you have the moonroof. Acceleration is about the same (Fiat has more HP but more weight). Gas mileage  (25 combined) is one less than the Crosstrek. Cabin noise is much better in the 500X. Rear visibility better in the 500X (I had to remove the rear headrests in the Crosstrek). Professional reviews complain about the 9-speed struggling to find the right gear, I haven't noticed a thing. Most importantly, did I mention how hot this thing is? Ow! Love it! (Cons: no cargo cover (though it's only a small gap between the back seats and the trunk), auto dim mirror on top model only, limited Fiat accessories, gas mileage should be better.)"
"98,000 miles Trekkking  2014 Fiat 500L Trekking. Just had my first real problem with the car. I drive it a little hard one morning and I started to lose power. My first thought was the transmission. I was able to get it to the dealer on its own by not driving hard. Turned out to be a turbo issue. The dealer said a clip holding on the waste gate was missing. Ok so replace the clip? Not the case you cannot order just the clip according to the dealer! the turbo is $900.00 plus 5-6 hrs. installation. Not a problem I have a third party warranty and I am under the 100k by just 1600 miles! Feeling good until the company that provides the warranty said this is not covers because you lost the clip. According to them it is not the turbo that is bad it is the fact that you lost the clip. Like I removed it! After going back and forth with them they agreed to sent out an adjuster to evaluate. I will add to this based on the final result. Bottom line I really enjoy the car, it has been reliable everyone that gets in it is impressed with the room and ride."
"First time in a Ford  I bought this car used with 101,000 mi. It has the 3.8 v6. It now, has 133,600 mi. The only things I've done to it is change oil, flush rad. and change brakes. I have mostly been a Chevy person, and have owned a couple Toyota's. But, I would buy another Mustang. Great car!"
"Transmission breaks  The first transmission got a little over 40,000 miles before it had to be replaced.  The new transmission went at 114,000 miles. So only about 70,000 miles on the second one. The cost to replace is in the thousands."
"own 2014 fiat 500L trekking  my trekking is great , for now i  have 51k and i  have not any problem. just changing oil and regular maintanance ."
"Keeping it much longer  This car is very comfortable and especially good for taller people with all the capability for changing seats, steering wheel.  I love, love the small turning radius.  I can u-turn in the smallest of spaces and get in and out of tight parking areas.  I also love, love what I call my deer lights which are the side driving lights.  I drive on many streets with no street lights and this comes in very handy to illuminate the sides of the road making night driving a whole lot easier.  Also great for watching for animals at night.  I thought I was only going to keep this car for 3 years but I am now on year 4 and will likely keep it another 2 to 3 years.  It has been very reliable.  I also drive the manual shift - not automatic.  The shifter has a real sporty feel.  The interior is very comfortable and I love the material used on the seats.  Rugged for someone with 4 dogs, doesn't make your clothes stick to it, non-sweaty, easy to clean, and looks great. Placement for water bottles and cups is terrific too.  I think they thought of everything."
My first Fiat Here in the States  I (we) love this car. it is fun to drive.  rides smooth. Front seats are a little small if your a larger person. Going to take it on our first road trip tomorrow.
"Love my Fiat!  We have a 500 and 500L. Love them both. The 500 is SO MUCH FUN to drive & handles better than any car i have owned, especially on highway. The 500L is slso fun and more practical when carpooling."
Fun to drive  Little beast. Fast small engine. Great fuel economy. Amazing handling and traction. Fun to drive. I love it.
Loaded 500L White  Very reliable- I have driven it R/T to New Orleans from Memphis numerous times with not one problem.
"Biggest mistake EVER. Nothing but headaches  DON""T buy Fiat if you want a quality automobile, if you are looking for cute and disposable then your in the right place, but if you like a return on your investment or a car that is safe and reliable or a company that cares about quality and helps their customers .. over 8 months of dealing with their Customer Service call center, multiple weeks of car being in for service. The car loses power when accelerating leaving the driver with no ability to move the car out of busy intersections, or the ability to go at all from stops. Random occurrences so problem is hard to replicate, have had the service engine light come on - even have pictures of it on - still to be told that the computer never shows or records a problem so there fore they can do nothing. I have called and open a ""case"" with FCA and all I am told again and again is sorry until I can show and have a service tech with me when it happens they can't do anything. I guess my word isn't enough, all the other online complaints I have found of others having the same issue mean anything. I am told it must just be an isolated incident. I figure until they are forced, sued or have someones death on their hands from an accident the issue will never be addressed. Don't buy FIAT ! To be safe avoid any and all FIAT/Chrysler products!!"
"'DON'T Buy ONE, Mayor REGRET!'  use it was cute, looked fun. I regret the day I did that, I've never had a vehicle with so much issues. lights go off frequently. Breaks inconsistent, lastly panel board goes crazy, with engine light, and others go off I call the dealership to take it in, I setup an appointment to have it diagnosed, they keep it for a week to advise me that the transmission is gone at 70,000 miles. I challenged that since I drove it there. I had researched recalls on this model, and was told that all the recalls where completed, I asked where and when and was told that the place it was originally done is no longer in business, sketchy with Fiat INC. they avoided me with follow up which made it even more frustrating. I highly recommend YOU to stay away from looking at this disaster of a car, the so called Corporate side of them is in complete denial, I'm now stuck with a car, that I serviced & maintained when due, to have this extra expense of a new trans that they priced at $5,400 to repair, is disheartening!!!"
"Over 20K on a 2014 Fiat 500L Trekking  It's a shame this car has gotten such bad press. I know some have had bad experiences, but I've read about others who have had wonderful experiences with this car. You can almost park this car almost anywhere -- I believe it's length is a few inches shorter than a Toyota Corolla -- yet it has such room inside for passengers and cargo. It's not a sports car, but it handles well enough and rides comfortably on all but the roughest or bumpiest roads. As of this writing, I have had no issues at all; just normal maintenance. The bad press has probably affected sales, so look carefully for a good deal if you're shopping for one."
"It is what it is  This was my first new car purchase and I really liked it at first....Untill everyone in Oklahoma city bought one. Atleast there will be pleanty around to pull parts of in the salvage yard. Guys and gals, this car is what it is plus a tiny, tiny bit more..... It's a (new) $20,000 sports car. I do actually love mine and it runs great but I can see it going to pieces not too far down the road. It's starting to rattle a little much and the two ""subs"" in the door aren't subs.... Subs are made to play mounted in a box, not mounted in a door but hats off to ford for at least trying to be hip. "
"not bad for a Ford  Purchased this car with only 20k.  Drove it for five years and finished with 58k before selling it.  Only mechanical issue I had was a... wow I can't remember, cost me bout $300.  I installed a Flowmaster exhaust, great sound compared to weak stock exhaust.  V8 power is robust, and runs strong well over 100mph.  Interior and exterior held up very well, still looked new when I sold it.  The drivers seat position is horrible, I felt like i was sitting in a beach chair that was lying on the ground."
"great little/big car  Easy to park due to small size yet very roomy inside, peppy engine when paired with the manual transmission, good cargo space, fold down rear seats are not flat unless you use the cover from the storage area in the raised slot to better align the floor of the storage area with the folded seats, stadium style rear seats so that you can easily converse with rear passengers and they can see the road and front seat rider, handles well in corners, can be choppy on poor road surfaces, generally get 28-30 MPG on mixed city/highway driving, both I and my wife own 500L trekkings which together have a combined mileage of 59,000 miles, so far no breakdowns at all and only one recall for airbags, we also opted for the lifetime warranties on both cars, it does have some features that may have led early buyers to think it has gremlins, when making turns the fog light on that side turns on which is great in the dark on sharp turns as it lights up the shoulder of the road for you, when we first bought the car we thought that was a electrical problem but it turns put the dealer had only just learned that it was a feature (which can be disabled from the touch screen controls), the dealer had actually been replacing units in an effort to fix what was not a problem, the GPS needs updated maps which we were told was due to the maps themselves that were being supplied for the system this is not really a major problem for the vast majority of the time the maps have been dead on, the biggest problem has been the owners manual itself, the index was compiled for a different manual entirely as the referenced page numbers don't actually take you to the information that you are trying to look up, also the information in the manual is very weak in useful content, the brakes can be grabby and take experience with the vehicle to learn how to modulate them (they still catch me off guard once in a while) but when needed they seem to stop the car quickly and in a relatively short distance, the air conditioning works well but does affect the gas mileage, the car did get good IIHS crash ratings which was a factor in our decision to purchase them, all in all a competent and reliable vehicle thus far, my other car is a 2007 mazdaspeed 3 so I know about and use quick cars that can handle and brake well; @@@@@@@@ 4/29/2017,,update- we are over 90,000 miles between the two cars, no issues, premium gas will get a little more pep, might be useful here in Florida with heavy air conditioner use but I don't bother, however this does not equate to an increase in gas mileage, don't be afraid to drop down multiple gears on the stick shift to get moving quickly as the top 3 gears are all overdrive ratios, initial pullout needs some revs, wonder if a lighter fly wheel would allow a quicker spin up on the first 1500 RPM's, that is getting a little more technical, Hey, FIAT engineers are you listening.  Gas mileage remains around 28,  a majority of in town stop and go will drop that to 23-24 MPG.  Car does need several thousand miles of break in to get best acceleration(noticeable difference),  hmm sounds like a lot of older American iron block cars."
Bad experience  
Fun useful car  Impressive cargo space. Great visibility.Has Abarth turbo engine -- ZOOM!!! Dealer support has been exceptional by my standards after 60 years experience driving many brands of cars and trucks. 125 miles per day at 30-33 mpg on regular gas. Fun car...........
"Pope Mobile is great car!  I bought this new in March of 2015. Advertised $8000 off MSRP. Great buy.  The turbo kicks in @ 3000 rpm's and it becomes a rocket! Easy access, massive headroom.  I have 10,000 miles and no problems.  I personally love the European Automatic Transmission (DCA). Feels like a manual without the clutch, Most new 2016 models at the dealers have an American Automatic. Guess some people didn't like the DCA. Plenty of trunk space, Always get great mileage."
Still a good choice after 56000 miles.  I have put 45000 miles on my 500L Trekking in 27 months. It is driven 3-5 days a week to work 24 miles one way. I have made numerous trips of 300 to 450 miles one way. I find the front seats become uncomfortable only on the longest trips. I track my MPG since new and average 30.3 MPG. My best is 39.8. I have the auto transmission and I did have to get used to it. It does not always shift smoothly. I had a problem with the engine check light due to a fuel vac leak. The leak was never found and the problem stopped over a year and a half ago. I love the dashboard. I like a simple layout and feel the FIAT gives it to me. The view from the drivers seat is beyond compare. Cargo room is great. I can carry 2x4x8 boards in the car. It has been a great little car. The TECH package was the selling point for me. The backup camera is awesome.
"Overall ok, now that we learned more  Overall this has been a decent car for us.  We've taken a number of long-ish trips (3-8 hours in the car), and we've never had an issue.  It's a comfortable ride (I'm 5'10, my wife 5'4 and we both fit comfortably in front or in back. We now have a son who is almost 1 and he's spent his entire life thus far riding in this car.  With the car seat in the middle, it's a little cramped in the back, but nothing bad. The trunk doesn't fit the jogger stroller very well, well just enough for the stroller and nothing else.  It will fit in the front seat (upside down), but it makes reaching the shifter a bit awkward.  We really should have gotten a larger car, but my wife LOVED the unique look of the car and the fact that you just don't see many of them around.The Navigation is acceptable, though I wish it had real time traffic updates and I wish the head unit had CarPlay (by Apple) support, it would make things noticeably easier for us, but after a few software updates the bluetooth connects to Siri and now we don't have the terrible default voice recognition software.  Plugging your iPhone into the USB port gets you a few different experiences, but the bluetooth pairing has been pretty good now.The only thing I haven't liked about the car is the transmission, and probably more about the lack of education about it.  When we bought the car, we were told about the different transmission, but never how it meant we had to treat the car differently than any other automatic.  A few months after buying the car, a drive through Starbucks opened up near our house to which my wife has become a regular at.  Sometimes she's had to wait in line quite a while and she'd sit in drive with her foot on the brake.  After a few minutes she'd notice a smell. It smelled like burning coolant or something sweet like that.  She tried to figure out the cause, but couldn't.  Every time we took it to dealer they could never replicate it.  Another time she actually had some smoke coming out from under her car. After some serious google-fu, I was able to track it down to the fact we should put the car in neutral when at a stop for ""a while"".  There's no documentation that says what ""a while"" is or anything, so now so long as it's not a stop sign we put it into neutral (stop light, drive through, or stop & go traffic).  We wish the dealer was more forth coming with this information when buying the car, in fact my wife may have actually changed her mind on the car with that information at hand, but all said she loves the car, just wishes it was a LITTLE bit bigger in the trunk.Update: 2/4/2017 - we've added another child to our lives and this makes the car feel even smaller. A double stroller will fit in the trunk but it takes some Tetris skills. There's no fitting an adult in the back with the 2 car seats. Maybe a super thin adult. When it comes down to it, when we are done with the payments this car will go to me and my wife will get a larger car to drive the kids around in. We should have gotten a larger car from day 1 unfortunately. If this car were larger it would be great.  Repair wise it's been pretty trouble free, which is good considering our local dealer stopped servicing FIATs and we now have to go 30 miles to get dealer warranties.Update 2/6/2018 - December 2017 the car had transmission issues with a lack of power. Could force it into lower gears via manual selection and go but it was tough moving from a stop. Took it to the local dealer (who never stopped servicing fiats even though they told me they were going to) and had them look at it. They thought it was one thing. 2 weeks later they still had it and it wasn’t fixed so they had to replace the entire transmission. That fixed it. But a new transmission at 30k miles is ridiculous. It was outside the warranty but we had our extended warranty which covers it for 10yrs or 100k miles, so out of pocket for us was $100. Would have been roughly $10k without the warranty according to the service rep. I can’t with good conscience recommend this car. I know with the 2014 or 2015 model they redesigned the transmission (pretty much standard instead of some double dry clutch monstrosity), and maybe that will improve the reliability of the car for those models."
"She's a keeper!  We've had our 500L for 2 years now, though have only put on 14K miles so far, and it's my wife's daily driver. Ours is the Trekking trim with the 6 speed Dual-Dry-Clutch Transmission. In response to an earlier recent review where the reviewer gave the car just 1 star, my experience couldn't be more different. To start off, I love the transmission, but I've adapted my driving habits to ensure its longevity. It is, after all, an automatically shifted manual- not a slush box.  What I'm talking about is, for example, to select the gear you want using the manual mode when in stop and go traffic, in particular when you're creeping along, and I always put it in neutral if I'm going to be stopped for any length of time. The reasons for driving the DDCT in this way are a bit technical, and maybe that's why dual clutch transmissions haven't caught on so well stateside. In any case, for 2015 all but the Pop trim come with the Aisin slush box if you opt for an auto transmission.  I've had no problem with the car rolling backwards on a slight incline when pulling away from a stop, and hill hold assist works well when on any incline greater than ""slight"".  The engine has proven to be plenty quick enough for merging with traffic etc. and frugal if you're easy on the gas. I've gotten upwards of 39 mpg when on back roads with no traffic, 34 or so on interstates, 25 to 27 in town (lots of cold starts routinely, so the economy suffers a bit for that).  Some criticize the 500L for having too firm of a ride, but to me it is sublime, giving a very nice balance between ride and handling. The steering weights up nicely as you turn in, though I wish the turn-in response were a little sharper. It is very stable once into a corner, and it's fun to hustle it if you're in the mood, though the car is really excellent at just cruising on a sunny day, esp. if you've opted for the panoramic roof.The 500L is reasonably quiet at highway speeds, and for our small family it's a great road trip car. The upright seating position gives us long term comfort,  and the expansive window area provides for an excellent view in all directions. We've found the front seats to be very comfortable with excellent adjustable lumbar support, though folks of longer inseam are more likely to have an issue with proper thigh support.  For 2015 the front seat bottom cushions have been lengthened to address this issue. How I have the driver's seat adjusted allows me full view of the instrument binnacle, though I can see where some might have issues with that- perhaps running a lower seat height and a bit more recline would do the trick for them. The parking brake handle works OK, though ergonomically it could be better. Infotainment is intuitive, simple, and has been trouble free for us. It synchs up with my 160gb ipod classic pretty quickly too. I've had Honda's, Acura's, VW's etc. and this has become my favorite. We decided to buy a MOPAR extended warranty just for peace of mind. Our's has been stone reliable save for the recalls for an airbag and a transmission re-flash.Update: We've begun our 4th year of ownership of our 500L now, and I continue to enjoy driving it. So far we've accrued 22,780 miles and counting, so slightly less than 8,000 miles driven per year on average. It's given us zero problems, its economy continues to be excellent (about 27.4 mpg lifetime) considering that it's had a life of cold starts and short trips. The dual dry clutch transmission continues to perform flawlessly, no chattering that I've experienced when driving other makes' cars equiped with dual clutch transmissions. I continue to stick it in neutral at stops, manually select 1st gear when creeping along in traffic, etc. - these driving techniques are second nature to the point I don't really think about it, done primarily in the interest of minimizing clutch wear, however I personally enjoy the extra engagement in driving our 500L this way. The seats are awesome, and the interior has held up very well- looks almost new still, despite our Havanese's best efforts to scratch it up. And it is a solid car- no squeaks or rattles whatsoever. The suspension rides as new, which is to say, excellent. I would have to say this car has more European character, for better or for worse, than most euro imports, but there is nothing about it that is so different that you can't come to terms with it. It just feels a little special and different. If I were to down grade it relative to what is out there in the marketplace today, it would be for the tech, though that could be said of most vehicles of the 2014 model year. Spy reports show Fiat giving the 500L a face lift for the 2018 model year, and it should be available with most, if not all, of the tech you could want, including all the safety nannies- though that's just speculation on my part.update August 2018- Our 500L is now my commuter car, averaging about 15K miles/yr. Fuel economy is now averaging 34.8 mpg."
"Excited to Frustrated/Alarmed  Excited to buy, loved having a fiat but should have done more homework but when we bought last year there was not this much about the cars. Purchased it as a commuter/local use. Love the room inside, lots of head room, wide so you are not rubbing you elbows and the back seat is very roomy as mentioned in other reviews.Cons:1. on a slight incline when you take your foot off of the brake the clutch takes about 2 seconds to engage, so you roll back and there is a slight pause before power goes to the wheels. Nearly got T Boned the first time, 2. going uphill the power steering looses power so you have to exert more muscle to turn the wheel, then in the middle of the curve the power returns and if you are not ready you end up in the oncoming lane, 3. As mentioned in earlier reviews the brake are not consistent, one time quick and grabby the next there is pedal drop before a smooth application, 4. The low beam headlights do not illuminate nearly far enough, I asked the dealer to dial them higher and he told me they were as high as they would mechanically go. I jus keep them on high beam all of the time and almost nobody notices, If you live in the city you would never notice but if you are driving around back roads or not spending all of your time on interstates then you will feel blind, 5. As mentioned earlier there are few dealers in the Dodge/Chrysler organization that have a trained Fiat mechanics so you have to go to the Fist dealer for anything beyond oil change despite the dealers claim that you can get service at any Dodge/Chrysler service shop, 6. The front seats are not comfortable for a drive longer than 20 minutes, there do not go back far enough for me to have my legs (5'10""), 7. The steering wheel tilts but only slightly so that if you tilt it up it stops and blocks part of the display, They give you plenty of head room but the car does not accommodate persons over 5' 5"" or so, we tested with friends, 9. we have had the car for just over a year and I was thinking about trading it in for another Dodge/Chrysler product and the dealer appraised the car at $8,000 and the salesman informed me that it was one of the worst depreciating cars in the USA and he had about 15 used Fiats. I am not 18 and understand car depreciate. I am also old enough over 45 to have driven many cars and know the difference between not liking the feel of handling of a car and not feeling safe driving a car. At first I thought I just needed to get used to it but over time it just gets worst and having to adjust my driving to keep from getting into a dangerous situation is not healthy.I made a big mistake purchasing this car for a number of reasons. I plan to trade it in as soon as I can research and purchase a replacement."
"Undervalued, poorly reviewed car = great deal1  CAR--2014 FIAT TREKKING MANUAL trans; BEATS Audio; fully LOADED (no sunroof, heated seats or visor-built-in garage door opener) PAID: $14,595 + tax/fees. (Last 2014 left on lot June2015, $9k discount.)   NOTE: CAPS are used for easy reference of points in article.REPLACED--2003 VW PASSAT wagon 1.8lTABOUT US—This is our SO CA 'family' car. We’ve owned mostly German cars (BMW & MB), my European husband was reluctant to buy it. This car cost half of the Subaru Outback wagon we intended on purchasing. We both have lived in Europe, so the look, size, & power of the car are not strange to us. We installed a THULE roof rack, a FIAT garage installed trailer-hitch for our Thule hitch-mounted bike rack. We are 5'8"" & 6'3"".SHORT REVIEW—We are impressed & got a great deal. I can’t stress enough: FIND A GOOD FIAT STUDIO/DEALER/GARAGE, as this will directly affect your satisfaction.INITIAL REVIEW--The GOOD--Great bang for the buck. Fun to drive. A comfortable ride with DECENT SUSPENSION. PASSENGER SPACE comparable to our Passat with better headroom (friends 6’5” sat in the back, & another 6’6” in the front comfortably). Both front & rear seats are adjustable to customize needs and comfort. Intuitive layout & usage of COCKPIT & CONTROLS. We are enjoying the technology: SAT NAV, tech ports, 110v plug, dash trip computer, etc. Good use of SPACE (for a car this size). THE WEIRD-- Strange PARKING BRAKE. Stalled 1-2xs daily for first few weeks getting out of FIRST GEAR (different than other cars we've owned). Optical illusion of SIZE & SHAPE--Car is much roomier inside than appears.6 MO REVIEW--OVERALL—Still enjoying the ride & options. Car is now broken-in (& so are we), so we aren’t stalling out of first gear beyond normal occurrences. We’ve gotten used to the PARKING BRAKE. The GAS MILEAGE is decent (22-23/city & +26/hwy, with nearly 30mpg on long hwy trips. Seems to be improving.) The Trekking’s FABRIC SEATS (leather not available on this model) are more self-regulating than I would have assumed. After our hot SO CA summer and now our ‘cold’ weather, all is well. (I don’t miss having heated seats.) A 500L’s sunroof’s screen is perforated, so it will not fully shut out the sun even when closed, and roof racks are not compatible, so I am doubly glad we don’t have one.CRITICAL—NO DEAL-BREAKERS. But…The DOORS lack a ‘stop’ mechanism, they don’t ‘fly’ open, but don’t open in a controlled manner when exiting your vehicle. The BLUETOOTH: good as an mp3 player, bad for talking on the phone. The MIC picks up too much sound from the dash vent & such. We had the ‘DEAD BATTERY issue’ (as noted by other owners) because of a SOFTWARE UPDATE that didn’t take (our FIAT studio’s garage checked-off as ‘done’), which was remedied by another FIAT garage. This other garage is a combo FIAT/JEEP, so they had the knowledge & know-how to install our TRAILER HITCH.So,—FIND A GOOD FIAT STUDIO/DEALER. Many negative reviews stem from issues with a dealership rather than the brand. Hopefully FIAT can remedy this somehow, as they put out a decent product. We have heard about some transmission problems, but we since we have manual, we are hoping to avoid that."
"Bought a 2014 ""New"" Treeking for $14K  Review 2014 FIAT 500L Trekking w/ 6 Spd manual white - no options besides 6.5"" NavigationPros: 1.  Paid $14k for a new car with 100 miles, full warranty (4 yrs/50 mi).  10/10)2.  Navigation, bluetooth, mp3 (via USB and/or SD card), andUconnect all work well. (9/10)3.  Comfort - very roomy.  Took my wife, daughter (5yr. w/ car seat), and in-laws to and their luggage to the airport - 10/10.4.  Manuverability/drivability - 1) the lighest clutch I've ever experienced.  2) short turning radius - makes parking and U-turns very easy.  3) Sturdy - feels like you are driving a Town & Country minivan (about the same ride height)  4) 1st gear is weird, but 3rd gear is when the torque shows up.  5)  drives well in the snow.  Was able to get up/over ice/snow covered hills that I used to get stuck on with old car.  6) at 700 miles, I get 24.5 MPG city, 34.5 highway.  The highest highway MPG was 37.0 (5 peo people plus luggage - going to the airport).  I paid $15 to fill my tank (regular, even though premium is recommended) a few days ago.  Small tank, decent range. 7) Power steering is like theold luxury cars from the 70's & 80's - light & easy.5.  Easter eggs - 1)  the first day I got it, the arm rest was in the way of my shifting.  You can lower it by pulling on the feont latch and pushing it down (at an angle) perfect for resting your arm and shifting.  2)  You can keep your headlights switched to ""on"" all the time - basicall like auto headlights.  3)  When you turn your wheel (right or left) the fog lights come on to light the path.  4)  the fog lights are very bright.  5)  You can set a max spedd limit to get a reminder of when you go over a certain speed (I set mine to 75).  You can also set the Navigation to aler t you when you are druving over the posted speed limit.5.  In reverse, the rear windshield wiper automatically truns on.6.  If you make a panic stop - hit the brake hard, the hazard lights will automatically flach - alerting drivers behind you.Cons1)  There are some rattles when driving over rough roads.  The conversation mirror makes noise if you forget to stow it.2) I was on the highway, and the fasten seatbelt buzzer went off.  I un-fastened and re-fastened my bektm but it cintinued to chime.  It only stopped when I buckled the (empty) frint passenger seat.  It hasn't happened since.  3)  one morning, I noticed that the exterior lights were on (overnight?), car was slow to start/crank over, but still started.  Will turn the lights one/off manually.Regrets:  None - At first I wanted Beats and the moonroof, and the black roof (with the rest of the car white), but it was beyond the scope of my budget, and would ultimately just make the car colder/hotter/louder. Looked at the 2015 Urbanna - but didn't want to pay more.  I could see black wheels getting old/boring after a few years.  I like tge styling and floating roof design w/ Trekking body cladding.Overall 9/10 - My parents alwats drover cars different than everyone else, and now so do I."
"Not a Bad Stang  So i have 149,500 on my 5speed hunter green stallion. Everthing has been good up till 120,00, but come on with that high miles something is bound to go wrong!!! It still runs but it need a new clutch, Motor mounts, and a tune up. Over all ill keep this car forever!!!"
"Too Much Too Soon  Service has been terrible.  Had it in 6 times for the check engine light.  Bluetooth is terrible.  I can hear who I've called, but when the car is moving, they can barely understand what I am saying."
"snow  flake sensor /  air conditoner...  ...  not  working properly.  my  brand  new   500L fiat , has  been  in the  repair shop (  call  studio by  fiat  customer  service ) , it has  been  the  same problem several times.when driving   appears  the  snow  flake ( sensor)  indicating  that  ICE ON THE ROAD;  and  then shut  down the  air conditioning , the system starting blowing  hot  air.it  is impossible  to  drive  a  car on hot  temperatures like in South florida , (temperatures almost 100 Degrees ).FIAT is very  disapoint ."
" i'm on my second one    50,000 miles in less than two years not one single problem on top of that I chipped and I  abuse it every time I drive  I even tow  4 x 8 trailer  I pool little over 2000 b.l with no problem  and yes my it's automatic  it's funny   The transmission doesn't belong in USA market  my opinion  for European is fine  but since I'm European myself I like it  but you just have to get  usted it  it's not that bad   I know some people still saying fix it again Tony  they need to change  Tony is long gone  it's not any different  In liability   of a Honda Toyota Subaru etc. "
"Never trust a Chrysler dealer  We like our Fiat, what we don't like is the customer service. We have 8832 kilometers on our car and a rattle/knock has started in the front end when going over small or large bumps. When we bought the car Chrysler said we could use any Chrysler dealer to service/warranty work on our car and when we called City Chrysler Corner Brook NL they said no we do not service Fiat. Called Fiat Canada and they told us we have to drive to the nearest Fiat dealer, 10 hours away in St. John's NL. Do your homework if you are planning on buying a Fiat, ensure you have a dealer close by and get everything in writing. We will be selling our Fiat and will make sure no one in Western NL buys a Fiat. "
"Another Fiat  Just upgraded my 500(Manual) after 53000 miles with only two issues - one was one headlight stopped working and Fiat replaced both, also, a problem caused by my cigarette lighter phone charger(blowing fuses). I needed more space, so, decided to upgrade to 500L(Manual) - Rosso Perla with White Roof. I am mid age person with plenty of experience as a car enthusiast. I do not buy European cars with automatic trannys, PERIOD!(bad experiences). Going to 200 miles so far and I am very happy at the least on how this puppy feels. Still have to get used to first gear(it sure is weird). MPG so far is around 29. Will post again in a few months again with more evaluation after break in period."
"BEST CAR I HAVE EVER DRIVEN  I have had this car for a couple of months And totally love it. Let me start by saying that it is true the first gear in the manual transmission takes a little getting use to. And no it doesn't takes off Or drive like a rocket..... But I love the styling because there is nothing like it. It is reliable, super confortable And awesome on gas. You want a testament to this.... With barely 2500 miles on it I took it on a loong road trip from WA state to Fairbanks Alaska. It drove up and down the mountain roads like it is what it was made to do. By the way I was fully loaded with suitcases, duffle bags with clothes and theblike... Average 34 MPG. Again best car ever."
"Great fun, jury still out on reliability  I've had the car for 9.5 months now.  I love the style, the roominess, the visibility and how much fun it is to drive.  It took a bit to get used to the transmission (manual, a little odd in first gear), but now it is great.  It did have a recall to repair a computer issue causing the battery to die when parked in the cold for more than 48 hours with no start, but hopefully that is resolved.  Some minor electrical things are a little quirky, but no big deal.  I had my VW golf prior to this for 15 years with no major issues (it had early recalls for an oxygen sensor chip so was not perfect), so reliability is my only real concern with the Fiat."
"Best Value in this segment by far  Like someone else said, this is one of the most underrated small cars on the market today.  It's well documented that Americans don't like wagons or minivans for that matter.  Well apparently neither do most auto journalists because this car is lambasted in every pupublication.  Just go drive one for yourself, these are TONS of fun. In Colorado here at this elevation Turbos and their forced induction rule the land.  Maybe in Texas at sea level this car seems pokey, but in this thin air this 1.4 direct inject turbo runs hard and is a blast to drive. I upgraded from a Mini Clubman and LOVE the fact I can fit 3 car seats wide.  To be fair I have the 6 speed manual so no automatic problems here."
"Best Decision I Ever Made  I absolutely love this car.  The interior space is incredible for a car this size!  It's fun to drive, fine on the highway and very well equipped.  I went from a Volvo XC90 to this seeking better gas mileage and got it, averaging about 28 mpg combined city/hwy.  I read up on the dual auto clutch from the information Fiat provided and have no complaints.  A well equipped car that is reliable and performs.  I also purchased the lifetime extended warranty for $2,500 although I read you could get it as low as $2,295."
"Worst mistake of my life  I traded in a reliable Rav4 for this piece of crap. For the first few months, the car worked well, aside from a few recall issues. After I'd had it for 6 months, the problems really started to surface. The check engine light kept coming on and I was taking the car to the shop nearly every other week. The transmission completely locked up at one point and I had to turn the car on and off several times before it unlocked. The transmission also began to jerk much more (yes it's quirky but this is NOT a feature) while accelerating and decelerating, making stop and go traffic particularly dangerous. I'm currently pursuing lemon law on this car so I can get rid of it!"
"FUN!  I love this car.. It's My first car and I'm proud of it. I have the 5 spd. It has plenty of power and i use it. It is comfortable to drive and to ride in, but the backseat is cramped. but its a sports car so its not suppose to be big. The sound system is pretty good and i love the cd player, it plays homemade cds and it sounds good. I love to hear the roar of that engine when the rpm's get up to about 3000. I haven't had it long but so far i have to get the front right brake calapaer cleaned out, i need to plugs, and my clicker doesn't work but i can live without that. This car is SEXY i think, Mine is all black with Cobra rims on it. I totally recommend this car."
"On our 2nd 500L and my 5th FIAT total  This has got to be one of the most underrated cars on the market today.  When you strip away the funky exterior (to American tastes) it's a great car, especially in a market segment that has essentially been abandoned.
 We bought our 1st 500L (Trekking w/manual trans) back in February.  Loved the car.  Only had minor annoyances (armrest and hand brake operation) that we would have found in any car.  Loved it for day to day driving, loved it on the freeway.  Used it to haul our 2 Great Danes around with us.
 When my wife wrecked the car and the insurance company totaled it, we immediately went to another 500L (fully loaded Lounge) without hesitation, because my wife was not hurt at all."
"Update after 2 years of driving.  I bought a 500L Easy with automated manual transmission from Fiat of Austin in October, 2013. When my wife wanted to purchase the Blue Chiaro color, and the dealer did not have it in stock, or on order, Lisa C., the manager, immediately got on the case, searched the orders coming into the US, and swapped inventory with a regional dealer, getting the color that we wanted. Delivery was smooth, and we (the car and I) got acquainted.This car is beautifully styled, in and out, is well built, and behaves normally in most unextreme conditions.  It is not perfect....I find the brakes to be a bit ""touchy"", but they perform well.I find the transmission quirky, but it performs well. Update: after 2 years of use this car remains comfortable, reliable, and versatile; excellent on long trips with one passenger and luggage. My other vehicle is a Mazda RX-8, so that I am well versed in the art of performance.Update : The Fiat continues to perform like a champ.  I really like the dual clutch transmission."
"Surprised at how much I like this car  I downsized to a 500L Easy with a sunroof and automatic from a VW Tiguan.At first I thought ""what have I done?"" but after a couple of months, and now that I'm accustomed to the quirky transmission, I totally love this car.It's very peppy and incredibly easy to maneuver.I have a 25 mile freeway commute and the 500L handles it with aplomb, and the excellent visibility is a big plus when changing lanes.Another big plus is how unique it is.I'm very happy."
"Owned lots of cars- this is one of the best  I've owned about 20 cars and trucks in my life and the 500L Trekking is one of the nicest vehicles I have owned.Nice design. comfortable, smooth ride. Fantastic pick up with the 6 spd. Trekking trim is really great.plenty of storage.The front side windshield windows make for great visibility.The only cons are the armrest is in the way of the hand brake.But it does fold up out of the way.And the driver side wiper does not lift up for easy window cleaning and snow clearing.You have to get the wipers in the ""up"" position and turn off the car so the wiper stays ""up"". Then you can lift it up off the window.That's an oddity."
Great car with Trekking collection 5  Have been driving it for a week nowPros:Excellent visibility 360°Great engine with turboAwesome seats and tech features.Cons:None yetWish:The headlights turned on when doors unlock
"It's been a Great Car!  I 've had the car since November of 2013. It's a Trekking with the 6 speed auto. I love the trans as it reacts like a manual without the fuss. I've had the computer flash done, but other than that no issues. I love the car. I've read all the complaints that other customers have been having and they have not arrived with my purchase."
"11k miles and counting  Our L family hauler just turned 11k miles. The dual clutch transmission has performed flawlessly despite the recall for the reflash. The winter here in New England has been extremely cold yet we have none of the cold start issues some owners have reported. Warmer spring weather has brought 32-37mpg around town driving. The roads around here are very beat up yet the L remains solid and rattle free. Our family of 5 fits great and any extra luggage goes on the roof. The L is a great buy. Don't let the negative reviews turn you off. Though many are certainly legit, just keep in mind many people abuse their machines and are often the ones who cry the loudest."
"Glad I Waited for Six Months to Review  I bought a Fiat 500L Trekking in September 2013. To be honest, it took me quite awhile to get used to its rather quirky transmission -- and I have a manual!! The issue was the six gears and the need for a quick shift between first and second. But now that I have gotten used to how and when to shift, I am very happy with my purchase.This vehicle has all the features of the pricier Honda CRV at about 5K less -- and it looks better and handles better on the road. Last month I took it on a 800 miles road trip and it was so enjoyable to drive.The gas mileage is also far better than I expected -- I am getting over 29 miles per gallon (combined highway/city)."
"Love Our Trekking!  Traded in a 500 Sport to get a bit more space.Our Sport had 8,500 miles with zero problems.We now have 2500 miles on the L.Very well built.Both cars were ordered with the manual transmission which I think is a better option.The negative reviews all seem to be on cars with the auto/dual clutch trans.Combined mileage is 27.3-mostly around town.33 mpg on highway."
"Fantastic value and just plain fun to drive  I purchased my 500L in early July 2013.When I tried to insure it, Progressive had no rate for this vehicle.This is how early I got in on the 500L.After 7 months I am more than pleased with the performance, quality, economy and just plain fun.There have been reports of transmissions issues, and while there were some that had issues, this was caused by a faulty version of the controller software, and has since been corrected.Those affected became a very vocal group of three or four people who have plastered false info every where they can.This is proven by the 25,000 plus units with the DDCT, the tens of thousands of Dodge Dart DDCT units and the 100,000+ good units world wide."
"2000 Ford Mustang 3.8  I was given this as my first car, and I love it. It has 115000 miles and is nine years old, but it is very reliable and runs great. My parents own this car for all of the original miles, and there has only ever been one minor problem with the engine, but it was resolved easily, and the oil is changed every 3000 miles. Mine has a automatic, but I would suggest a five speed manual. I also installed aftermarket headers and exhaust."
"Fiat 500L Easy with Sunroof.  We purchased a 500L Easy Rosso Perla with Red/Cementite Seats and sunroof at the end of 11/2014. I really enjoy the dual clutch transmission gives me the ""manually feel"" but I do not wear out my left knee in city traffic.The adjustability of steering column up/down in/out is excellent.The vehicle is mainly driven in the city we have done some highway driving one 3 hour trip and the ride was very comfortable.With the rear seats down I was able to get a 55 inch flat screen TV in the box with about 1'' to spare with length and width in to the 500L.The 500L has the Daytime running lights which I have enabled.The UConnect works well with my iPhone.We just returned car at lease and of 39 months. No issues with car, just recalls and normal maintenance. We still completely enjoy the vehicle.The primary reason for returning the vehicle was the local Fiat Studio closed and the next closet Studio is to far away. Otherwise we would have bought out the lease."
"Dangerous Vehicle -- Do not consider buying  I purchased a 500L Trekking for my wife three weeks ago.After the first week, we drove down the road and the transmission was locked in 2nd gear.It would not shift up or down -- even with auto stick.We had to pull over and shut the car off -- then it would not restart because it was locked in second gear.We were stranded on the side of the road.We eventually made it to the dealership and they gave us a 500L loaner -- the next day the same thing happened with it!Check the Fiat 500L forums and you'll find that this is a known and common issue.There are also multiple complaints with the NHTSA.After 28 days (just before the Lemon Law kicked in) the car was returned with a supposed flash update to the transmission but the problems continued.On top of that, the car would not start in cold weather.Six months into ownership, the car was totaled with my pregnant wife and one-year old daughter on the car.  Thankfully the airbags deployed (at least they worked unlike the rest of the car)."
"NEVER BUY FIAT!!  I got the car, drove it home, very next day it didn't start.Took it to the shop, it said, ""It's too cold for it here"" (Northern Indiana)...Brought it back home, drove it for three days (300 miles) with starting issues...then it totally broke down.Wouldn't start, stereo was cutting out and blowers on the heater/air conditioner stopped working.Call for Fiat Roadside assistance, three times a day for 6!!!!! days until they finally came to get it.Towed it to the shop where it has sat for two weeks.I am getting the run around completely."
So many Issues Do Not Buy  I bought this car oct 30 2013. It has been in the shop 4 times for weeks at a time. The check engine lights and transmission lights go on. The whole car has lost power leaving me with no power steering brakes flying down the HWY 70 mph. The car is unsafe. Fiat acts like they never heard of this issue but I have found other people on forums that have had the same so apparently its an issue. I don't feel safe in the car and they are refusing to help me. 
"2500 Mile Review  This car has excellent interior room for its size.For me, it is the perfect size vehicle.I wanted something smaller than a CUV, but still can fit some cargo.The exterior and interior styling is unique and looks upscale.The tech is user friendly.It has plenty of power and can be fun to drive.I say can because the vents and cheap interior plastic vibrate and rattle if not on a freshly paved road.Also, I hate to turn off the bass on the Beat audio because it made the plastic on the door rattle.Forgot putting stuff in the glovebox or center console unless you want the sound of a baby rattle.Occasionally the car won't kick-on when turning the key, but it has on a 2nd turn."
"First Fiat  This is a great looking small car with a surprising amount of interior room.I love the emerald green color that I selected.It is recommended to use premium gas and the engine does seem to run smoother and more responsive with premium gas.I am not sold on this ""automated manual"" transmission.It feels somewhat unstable and it is difficult to shift from park to reverse when parked on hill with the front of the car higher than the rear.The gas mileage is subpar for a small front wheel drive car.I have averaged 25mpg in primarily city driving.Overall, this car has it perks and drawbacks.As for competitors: Soul and Juke were too much of a kid car. Encore cramped and Mini CM pricey"
"Broke Down Already!!  I bought my Fiat 500L about 3 weeks ago.I was on my way to work, when it started shaking and the transmission light came on.I had to wait for Fiat to open and the car had to be towed in.This Maxwell Supercenter has no clue how to repair the car and I have been without it for a week.The manager, Jack M., has been Very difficult and even though I got a call today, after 7 days, I do not feel comfortable and safe in My Fiat.I plan to return it.The GM (Lisa C.) here at Austin Fiat has no concern and when my attorney confronts her with the Lemon Law and demands a refund, maybe she will sing a different tune?I have been stunned at the poor service I have received!"
"Fiat 500L automatic  I really like my new 500L but it does not like me. After 6 days, 350ml, it broke down in stop and go traffic on I-25 outside Denver. The twin clutch automatic heated up, smoked and therefore the system shut down. Had roadside assistance tow it back to the Fiat dealer. After setting for three days the car started okay and was drivable. The dealer could not find any problems, the engineer in Italy could not find any problem with the readout data. Their comment was that with the stop and go traffic the 500L twin clutch automatic acted ""normally"".So what am I to do?? Not drive the car in USA stop and go traffic?!Fiat USA is still working with me so hopefully there will be a positive outcome."
"Very happy but disapponted  I really LOVE this car, after last year test driving several cars (soul, mazda, crv, tiguan, etc) , finally found this one to replace my old Honda crv 2000 , I quite love the space and size of the car, and its response to aceleration, my friends like the space in the back seats, is a very good looking car, the BUT is , after a week only , had an issue with the engine /oil , disapointing in a new car, things like this can happen,and will see if after the fix, car performs well and no more issues."
"Second Fiat  I loved my 2012 500c but found myself needing something a little larger.I traded in the cabrio for the new 500L and am very pleased with it so far.I've only driven 500 miles on the new one, so time will tell if it is as reliable as the little 500 was.I'm very happy with the Dual Dry Clutch Automatic.It is fuel efficient and has the pick up I need for merging into heavy traffic on the highway.Taller people fit well in the car, even with the sunroof.The car has an excellent ride quality and everything works as it should.It is comfortable, has great visibility, plus it's fun to drive."
"2000 v6 Coupe 5 speed  Overall this is a decent car - But it's not the fast/fun mustang everyone makes it out to be.   The car is very slow when put side by side with other sport coupes of it's year.  The interior looks good, but is very very cheap. **EVERYTHING** rattles and makes noise inside the car.  The seats are very boring and uncomfortable,  and the worst part is terrible highway driving in 5th gear.  The car handles well in dry weather, but isn't very balanced.  The rear suspension is bad - leading to serious fishtailing out of turns , bad rain traction, and unstable turns if you hit any small bumps.  It's a reliable car,  but sport coupe? no...not really."
"A Great Car, ignore the ratings and reviews !!!!  This car has true Italian Styling. It is very comfortable with plenty of room. Although a little sluggish with the automatic, you have the option of changing gears yourself that gives your 500L a lot of kick. Handling should get great ratings from anyone. I have had mine for over a year and trouble-free. I also love the room in the back. If you are looking for a great car that is roomy, versatile and looks great....the 500L is it."
"Fiat 500L - Much better than you've heard  I continue to be amazed by the relatively poor reviews given to this car by the ""experts"".  We have had ours for 1 1/2 years now and continue to find it a quality car with excellent driving characteristics and versatility.   Give it a chance and you will love it.   I know people have concerns about Fiat reliability.  All I can say is that since we bought it we have been back to the dealer just once for routine oil change.Update:  Our Fiat continues to perform flawlessly.  I love how it drives, very nimble and oh so practical.  Still no reliability problems.   Back for routine service (oil changes) only.   Remain puzzled by the continued poor reviews of this car.  I would encourage you to at least look at it and test drive if you are in the market for a small cross-over.Update:  We are now at 30,000 miles and our Fiat 500L continues to perform flawlessly.   We continue to enjoy the practicality of the car but also its fun factor.  I still don't get the negative reviews from so many ""experts"".   Reliability has been perfect - we literally have had nothing needing to be fixed other than a software update done at a routing oil change.  Update:  now at 20,000 miles and 2+ years of ownership.  Continue to be very pleased with the handling, economy, practicality, and yes, RELIABILITY.    We have had zero repair issues with this car so and it continues to drive like new.  Again a very underrated car.  Give one a look and test drive and see what you thinkUpdate:  now at 3 years of  ownership and we continue to love our Fiat 500L.   Sadly because of what ji can only consider to be biased reviews, sales for the model have not  been good.   I would suggest that if you are in the market for a small crossover or  wagon type of  vehicle that you at least look at this car and decide for yourself.  Our  reliability has been perfect - no problems at all.  It handles great, good mpg, and very practical.  What is not too like about it?"
One Year of Ownership  The 500L has been trouble free for my first year of ownership.  Software updates by the dealer improved the 6 speed transmission. The best part of owning this car is how easy it is to get in and out of.  It is tall so it feels like a much larger vehicle. Large doors and the back seat  with a almost flat floor makes it easy for rear passengers.   I am a fan of the U-Connect system.  The outward visibility is aided by a high driving position.
"Avoid fiat 500l  The car was under warranty, but had many repairs within 30k miles.  Resale was HORRIBLE."
"Growing on me  Blind spots! Get to know you blind spots.  Sluggish acceleration.  Top heavy. Love the size, the look and, so far, the reliability."
"Best Kept Secret  Really do not understand the negative press reviews for this car.  This is my second FIAT, trading up from the 500 to the 500L.  I've come to the conclusion that people in this country reject things that are different or unique.  The design of the 500L is ingenious - for its size it has amazing interior volume.  The ride is very comfortable and it has a great seating position, sitting higher than many crossovers.  I'm not sure why the press reviews say the car is under-powered. The engine is turbocharged and - at least in mine - when I hit the pedal that car MOVES!  It handles quite well and is fun to drive, even for as tall as it is.  Most reviewers have highly criticized the looks of the 500L but I have only gotten nice compliments on it.  With all those windows, the high seating position, and spotter mirrors on both sides, all around visibility is amazing!  FIAT has some quirky features and design elements, but I think they make the car all that more appealing.  Some of the interior trim could be nicer, but most cars today are filled with hard plastics - most of the hard plastic surfaces are slightly textured, so I don't think they look cheap.  I have almost 20,000 miles on mine and aside from routine maintenance, the only issue I've had was with a rattle in the back (fixed by the dealer on the first visit).  FIAT stands behind their products with an impressive 4 year/50,000 mile warranty, too.  On one hand, it is a shame this car doesn't sell better, but I have never been one to drive what everyone else is driving, so I like driving what I consider to be the best keep secret out there!  I would absolutely but another one without any hesitation.  Do yourself a favor - ignore the press critics and focus on the reviews of people who drive these cars day in and day out."
Saved my life!!  I bought a 500L Trekking I'm 2014. After half a year of smooth sailing a crazy person ran a red light and almost killed me. I had four surgeries. The car saves my life. The frame held up despite the awful crash. Now I bought a new leftover 2015 600L Easy. I missed this car so much. I'm glad to be alive and happy to be on the road with this dependable and absolutely adorable car!!
"I sold this nightmare  I sold this garbage car as soon as my family figured out that FIAT will not fix transmission overheating problem. One day, this garbage stopped on the road right after exiting McDonalds' drive-thru while giving out really bad smell. I could smell, my wife could smell, even the employees at the restaurant could smell the burning or melting odor. The car didn't start for 10 min. with an on-screen message like I need to put the gear to N then R then P or something. Now, it started to run again. I searched internet because it was Sunday and the FIAT dealership didn't provide any repair service. BTW, I found out that there are several issues just like me. And, more importantly, all of these reviews reported that both dealership and FIAT headquarter denied to identify and fix this issue. Only solution was just to continue driving this garbage with fear. Well next Monday, I brought this car to the dealership, and their reaction was ""exactly"" same with other reviews. ""Can't replicate or duplicate the issue"", ""There is no error record on the computer"" and ""Drive your car home as is"". Next day, I went to a Japanese car dealership and sold the garbage and bought much more reliable car. If you are rich, you can buy FIAT. But, if you wanted be frugal and smart, go to more reliable automakers. FIAT's reliability is 28th out of 28 automakers in 2015 Consumer Report."
"Fun and Functional  Having owned a fiat 128 Sedan, Fiat 128 3P, Fiat Bravo, and Fiat Spyder 2000 and loved them all I thought I would give Fiat another try since my wife has had a trouble free 500 Sport since 2012 with no problems.I traded in my luxury ride Buick Century for a 500L and I am in love with it. It has plenty enough power to get you on the interstate and cruise at the traditional 5 mph above the speed limit, as well as, get you in and out of tight spots. I especially love the option of running the gears yourself with the optional 6 speed automatic.It has lots of room both front and back and handles like a European Car should handle. It cuts and turns quickly and holds the road beautifully. All of that while maintaining a comfortable ride.I noticed that it stands just a few inches short of my 2003 Chevy Venture van.The appearance means a lot to me also, as it is highly unique and does not have the cookie cutter design that most cars have.In general, it looks great, is functional, roomy, powerful enough and fun to drive."
"Disagree with the experts. This car is underrated!  This is the 11th new car I have purchased and this is one of the most enjoyable. My 2015 500L is a pleasure to drive. This vehicle has received  more than a few negative professional reviews  but I strongly disagree. Yes the center armrest is narrow but it is functional. I do not mind the emergency brake handle location. The car provides a great view of the road and the seating position is excellent. The ride is tuned to a good level in my opinion. I live in Chicago and this car has proven to be easy to park in tight city street spaces while providing excellent interior volume. Great cargo space for those larger purchases. Highway performance is also good, I have averaged 33 mpg.  My children love this car and prefer to ride in it vs our Ford Taurus. I was in the market for a Chrysler 200 but when I could not find one equipped to my liking I took a chance on test driving the 500L and never looked back. Yes I was concerned with the professional ratings and reviews but my experience has been all positive. I have not experienced  the brake fade some reviewers did.My car came with the Beats audio system and I frequently have too adjust the base level down as it is tuned too a level way too high."
"Aweome First Car  Just bought my red 2000 Mustang GT fully loaded with every option checked but the automatic transmission from a private owner a couple weeks ago as my first car (I'm 20) and I love the thing. Its perfect for a 20 year old guy. V8, stick shift, enough room for me and a friend. Has plenty of power both on the highway and in town and it handles great. I'm very glad I bought it. I haven't experiences it in the snow yet which I'm a bit nervous about but you'll definitely be seeing a review by then."
"Love this car  Owned a 2014, but didn't like the twin clutch so I upgraded to the 2015.  I love the car again. With snow tires I don't need 4 wheel drive in Salt Lake City and I take myself and three others and their gear skiing every week.  I don't need a rack either.  I just fit it in the back no problem."
"Awesome Car!  This car is a great value for my money. It's fun to drive and its comfortable for me and my family. Also, this car does not look like a cookie cutter car. It's unique and at the same time cute. This car is well worth the   money."
"UPDATE: AFTER 3 YEARS: AMAZING/BEAUTIFUL/RELIABLE  UPDATE: AFTER 3 YEARS:AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL, RELIABLE.IT'S A GLASS CHAMBER ON WHEELS. STILL A HEAD-TURNER.SHE BRAVED TOUGH UPSTATE NY WINTERS AND NYC JAMS ALIKE EFFORTLESSLY.FUEL ECONOMY STAYS AT 27 MPG.I AM AT 33K MILES.________________________________After one year of ownership, I fully stand by my first review.No glitches, no electronic problems, excellent mileage!rides as news, responsive and a true pleasure to look at and to Use it on a daily basis. Ice and snow have returned to my area - the car braves it all. same grade as year ago - A+ !!--------------------What a jewel! After 13 long and great years with my Toyota Matrix, time for change. Bought - a month ago - a top-end 2015 Fiat 500L Trekking Auto (with sunroof) and all the extras (park camera, fog lights, beats sound, etc.) and I cannot be Happier!! Easily, this is the most underrated vehicle in our land. Is it a stand-out? Yes. Is it of the boring same-ness of your usual highway gray/black/white avalanche of moving ""boxes"" on wheels, No! Leaving the outstanding aesthetics of this truly Italian design (at its best, think Pininfarina), how about getting 26.1 mpg in the first 1298 miles! I was not expecting this kind of fuel economy. My sticker said, 25mpg combined…so this is a bonus! Heavily driven so far in the best of both driving-validating worlds to compare - the epitome of an urban jungle - New York City's unforgiving traffic - and the pristine, meandering beauty of upstate New York, I must say, this car is a Winner. Popemobile, size-wise - no; Plenty of space Inside!! Unlike the VW sport wagon or Ford transit wagon, no cramped cockpit with your knees squeezed. Brisk maneuverability, great for parking and good storage space (at expense of smallish back seats). Quick, responsive engine - the turbo kicks in like a jet - whisks you when you need it most; merging in traffic, changing lanes, etc. Incomparable views! Visibility is outstanding. Heavy rains upstate for the past 3 days (and nights) and Not one drop inside of car…even if basically the entire roof being glass (half of it operable/can open). Seats are ergonomic/comfortable and firm (sorry coach potatoes), lumber support, excellent. Everything is adjustable so it's not just good for a 6'2"" guy…;..too bad we don't have the European long body version of it. This car also will talk to you - voice recognition works seamlessly and pairing my smartphone took 2 minutes. Infotainment system is impeccable. The space inside, along with the plethora of great sound - jazz, blues, classical, info, whatever is your wish - makes me feel like in a concert hall. To all those who hesitate, Don't! I would like to stress, it's not just the design that is great but Function-saturated feast on wheels. What's amazing is that what appears small is actually big! And once inside, you stand in a very comparable height level (i've got the 17"" wheels) with all the SUV's mastodons around you. So for those of smaller stature, you'll feel at great driving height, Without paying a fortune for a ""true"" SUV...The price value was unbelievable. I got a great deal and I quickly seized it as I bought the car for under 20k..!! My grade: A+."
"More spacious than it looks - Trekking way to go!  I had been waiting for the 2016 models to come out, but I found the body on the 2015 500L Trekking model to be a far more attractive and more Italian look. I ended up buying the 2015 500L Trekking with the ""Beats"" sound system with SiriusXM satellite radio, AISIN Heavy Duty 6-speed automatic transmission and U-connect touch screen. I use it for driving around San Francisco with all the hills and find it handles well. I love the headlights that move to follow your turns and curves. It is very easy to fold down the rear seats and create a spacious flat cargo area. The back seats also have the ability to recline to an almost flat bed like seat. The dual climate control keeps the front seat passengers happy and as the driver I enjoy the comfort of Power driver 4-way Lumbar Adjust. The visibility is amazing! With large windows all around and front pillar split by glass and wraparound rear windows. I also own a VW Touareg and honestly have better visibility in this Fiat.  Features like the rear backup camera, rear park assist system and  hands-free phone connectivity add to safety and convenience. The 17-inch wheels hold the road well even when driving on the freeway in rain. All in all for the price I paid I feel very satisfied with my new car and must admit I enjoy the compliments from those who notice it in the bright yellow and black combination. The gloss black instrument panel bezels are a beautiful upgrade included in the Urbana Trekking Collection 1."
"I LOVE my 2015 Fiat 500L Trekking 6-speed automati  I had a 2012 500 Sport and it was time for something bigger, I love the look of the 500X and had to take one for a test drive. I picked a Black 500X Trekking AWD, I liked the comfortable ride and was impressed with the 9 speed transmission. While talking about the numbers with my sales person, I could not take my eyes of this 2015 Rosso Perla colored 500L Trekking that was on the show room floor. After a few days I still could not get that car out of my mind, so I went back and test drove that 500L and I loved the cavernous feel on the inside, but it isn't enormous outside (love the cargo area and fold down back seats); it sips gas, has really good visibility, comfortable front seats and a smooth drive. The AISIN Heavy Duty 6 speed automatic shifts great and responds well when I need to down shift for passing or merging onto the highway.So for me I had to have the 500L Trekking, a week after I got it we took it on our family vacation. And it was very comfortable on that long 4 hour road trip to Todd PA. It got around 34 mpg (all highway driving) and on my normal day to day driving I average around 30 combined.I do love this car. I've had no problems whatsoever with it (it's still very new, only 1850 miles, so I'll keep my fingers crossed).It's weird, cute, bug-eyed looking and these are all positives to me. I have absolutely no regrets having moved into a car that performs the same functions of getting me around, but gives me so much more enjoyment than the average same-old same-old car everyone else has.Family, friends and coworkers always ask me ""Why another Fiat?"" aMy response is always the same, go test drive one for yourself and you will see why I love them. Not every poor review about the Fiat brand is true; you can't believe everything you read.After a year of ownership, the Fiat 500l  Trekking is one of the best vehicles I have owned. Unlike other reviews I have not had any problems with the 500l. The only time it has seen the service center is for its routine maintenance. So let me say it again, not every poor review about the Fiat brand is true; you can't believe everything you read."
"Sleeper of a deal...  WHY is this car not more popular?  I mean, I know it looks ""different"", but that's a good thing in the endless sea of ""blah"" crossovers and SUV's.  Had to give up my beloved VW GTI because we're ""of a certain age"" and getting in/out of a vehicle is now a major factor for us.  This thing is a hoot. I don't understand any of the reviews that state the car has a rough ride.  We rented a Cadillac ATS a while back, and this cars ride is, unbelievably, just as good.  We find the engine plenty peppy (remember, I traded in my GTI for this), the transmission is just fine, and the steering is nice and light for dodging other cars in parking lots.  I've got 1000 miles on it as of this review, and no problems.  The interior of this car is GI-MON-GOUS.  Huge headroom, legroom, and space in all directions.   I wish more people would test drive these things;  Once you drive one, you'll buy it.   Very very European driving experience.  You'll love it."
"Our Italian Car -  Read a lot of reviews - Bad and good. Decided to visit OCFIAT, took a test drive (500L Urbana Trekking with BEATS sound) bought the car one week later. Love the car ever since. Bought mine at Orange County Fiat (Costa Mesa, CA.)"
"Fiat 500L = Fun Italian Ride  This little Italian charmer has been quite a refreshing joy to drive over the last few weeks. The performance of the multi-air turbo is phenomenal and unexpected. For its size, the 500L is nimble and handles more like a sports car than the Fiat self-described ""Urban Utility Vehicle."" I highly recommend the Trekking version of this vehicle. It is a better designed model than the others offered and more rugged in appearance. "
Very Happy!  At first I was skeptical about this car but I am thrilled with it.  It is so comfortable and fun to drive  Feels very sturdy and reliable.  The exterior is a bit quirky but I think that makes it fun...I am sick of buying the same old same old.  Very roomy vehicle with lots of bells and whistles.
"Nifty and fun, nice extras  I always start with the negatives I note.  First would be the fabric.  I'm simply not fond of it, it reminds me of heavy duty panty hose and seems to pick up dirt easily.  The center armrest is very high and awkwardly placed.  There is so much width the door armrest isn't really reachable, either.  That said...I love driving this car.  After years of soccer mom-mobiles, I wanted something small, easy to maneuver and park, better on gas, and fun.  However, we have two large dogs and stepkids on weekends.  This is a perfect blend for us.  Room for five without needing a shoehorn, and not like driving a Sherman tank.2 years later.  I still LOVE this car.  Except for a couple of minor sensor issues fixed under warranty it has been trouble free.  Our summer here of 120 and higher do hurt the mileage, about 25mpg in summer, but I get a solid 33mpg in the cooler months.  Has had regular dealer maintenance.  I've replaced a headlight bulb, a reverse light bulb, tires, and brakes in 50k miles.  So I will be a repeat customer.  I still get compliments on my little beep beep!!!"
"Tamed Pony  Got this car used with 65K miles, since I couldn't afford an Accord or Solara Coupe. Overall the car has been pretty good to me. No major repairs, just maintenance. This car is NOISY. Ford really cut a lot of corners when it came to quality and craftsmanship. Wind noise intrudes at high speeds and it feels like a shopping cart on rough roads. The power-steering wines, but this seems to be common. The seats are a joke, they offer little to no support up front. This cars goes through brakes fairly quickly. My driver's side windows sticks in hot weather, paint has faded, and the engine rattles at high RPMS. Transmission seal leaks are common as well, but that's been the most of my problems. "
"Already broken after one year!  I've leased my 2-17 500e for one year (only 7k miles driven) and yesterday, it stopped taking a charge. Thankfully it is under warranty, and Fiat came to tow it to the dealership because it didn't have enough miles to get there. The dealership is 40 mins away, they're backed up and won't get to look at my car for another day, and they had no loaner car for me (although they did agree to cover my rental, if I made my way to Enterprise and dealt with that paperwork myself. Thanks for the terrific convenience, Fiat. If your car breaks on me while under warranty, you should probably consider making my experience very convenient.) On another note, we also have an electric BMW i3. I have driven it and the Fiat the same distance, and the BMW uses substantially less ""miles"" to go the same distance. I know it is said that the amount of miles used depends on how you drive it, but I find the Fiat to be far less reliable in terms of how far I can actually go, compared to the BMW (which is twice the price, so you get what you pay for!)  Also, the suspension bounces all over the road, and it breaks very abruptly. I have skidded out a few times accelerating on a hill."
"A real-world 500e review  We just bought a used 2014 500e with 28k miles. Dealers are currently offering nice pricing as many 2014's are coming off-lease and being turned in. We paid $7500 + tax. which seems very cheap for car that cost $30K a few years ago. The limited market and relatively high production volume keep the current resale value low.  The car is blast to drive at lower speeds...  It's very quick and can zip in and out of traffic lightning fast. It feels light, nimble and could probably beat many expensive sports cars up to about 60mph. If you install a 240v fast-charger in your garage and only commute in the city or shorter distances -- the car is fantastic. If you have to travel over 25 miles on the freeway to work, I'm sorry to say the car is a joke. I would not recommend this car for commuting. The problem is that once you exceed 50mph, the battery charge diminishes shockingly fast, to the point where you may be scared you won't make it. It almost seems as though the car needs some kind of overdrive system because it uses tons of energy at 65mph, even with no throttle. In the city, it has regenerative braking to help recharge, but on the highway the motor eats battery power like crazy. The fully-charged ""96-mile range"" can only last about 40 miles at 65mph. If you commute, you'd better have a fast-charger at work or you may not make it home."
fiat 500e  best car for lonely commute
Love it!  Explore the lease option.
A blast!  Fun to drive.  Great acceleration and good handling.
"When you need a simple and efficient car  Having originally leased a 2016 FIAT 500e, when it came time to find a new vehicle due to high mileage driving, I did not hesitate getting a previous year model, since electric is the way to go, and I have enjoyed good reliability and efficiency with the Fiat 500e. When looking at previous vehicles, you just need to factor technology and bluetooth as upgrades needed."
"Fiat 500e is Brilliant  Amazing peppiness, road handling, and comfort.  Unbelievable financing.    I drove a 2013 for 3 years on lease, and the dealership gave me such a good deal on a 2017 that I drove it out of the dealership the day I returned my 2013.  The range and mpg-e are better than reported by the EPA.  The 2013 had only one recall, and that was a software upgrade.  I have been building and driving EVs for 25 years and this is the best ever, excluding Tesla.  Tesla is the best car in the world."
"Great-ish car.  I like the way the car drives, but dislike a lot of the interior features.  First off, the performance is great and I've never had such a fun car to drive.  The acceleration sets you back in your seat and is instantaneous.   I don't mind the range as we kept our gas cars and 95% of our driving is local.  The charging has been fine with the standard 110 outlet and I don't see a need for the fast charger.  My 7 year old daughter fits in the rear seat without a problem, but I'm happy the lease will be up in a few years as we'll run out of room as she grows.  As for the bad....Headroom is awful.  I'm 6'3"" and basically have to put my head into the sunroof area to drive.  Backing out of a driveway is difficult as the rear visibility is very poor.  I'm happy for the sensors.  Storage inside the car is also horrible.  The glove box interior is flat so all your stuff comes out when you open the door.  The cupholders are too close together for even 2 medium drinks.  There's nowhere to put a cell phone.  I hate the radio.  There's a navigation warning that comes on for a while that prevents you from changing the channel...unless you take your eyes off the road and hit the ""accept"" button twice.  I don't need navigation as my cell phone does it better.  The Satellite Radio sounds compressed and worse than a cassette tape.  There's no CD player.  I love audio and honestly can't speak to the quality of the speakers since broadcast radio is the best quality thing I've listened to.  I hate that every statistic is listed in MPGe, but we fill the car in kilowatts.  I find MPGe to be a worthless number.  One cool feature about the car is the smartphone app that allows me to turn on the climate control before I get to the car.  It's just tough that it only turns on the last setting you had.  If I drove with the air off and the windows down, I have to remember to turn it back to automatic 68 degrees when I park if I want to use the app.    I also love/hate the App's function to show where the car is because it allows the person with whom you share the car with to spy on you.  I have nothing to hide, but it gets weird when the other person knows where you went out for lunch.  The regenerative braking is cool, but it doesn't seem to activate fully until the car is less than 90% charged.  i.e. It will regenerate up to -10kw, but after 89% battery remaining it will go up to -40kw regeneration.  It almost pays not to fully charge the car if you don't need the range.    There's also a weird spot between 5mph and 0 where the brakes engage differently and grip strongly into a forceful stop.   Overall I like the car as a car, but don't like the comfort features.  I'll miss it when the lease is up because it is such a unique experience."
"My Favorite car out of dozens!  I bought this car because 95% of my driving is short range for shopping, post office, etc. when I am not traveling out of the country for business.  Also - the dealer and government incentives made the lease price so low, the car was essentially free - the lease is about the amount I paid for gas monthly.   I truly did not expect to fall in love with this little car!   It makes me smile every time I drive it.  It is amazingly quiet and solid, and very quick.  You really need to watch your speed.  It brakes very well, and also handles better than expected considering it has hundreds of pounds of batteries in the floor. Whenever someone new gets in, the first thing they say is ""Wow - it's nice!  And it's roomier inside than I expected!""  It is usually just me and a dog, or the two of us, but we have had 4 people in the car to go a short way to dinner, etc.   The fact that there is NO SOUND except the (excellent) radio turning on when you ""start"" it, still takes some getting used to.  The seats are surprisingly comfortable considering that they are so small and thin.  Totally adequate for the car.  The sound system is better than my Acura's.  The NAV is a simple TomTom system, but it works, and it has nearby charging stations pre-programmed in.  The Bluetooth works perfectly as does the climate control system.  This little car really is well equipped with everything except a backup camera, but the rear bumper is about 10"" behind the rear window so it isn't a  serious issue, and it has the parking sensors anyway.    Yes, there are a few little ergonomic issues about the car that frustrate me, and the steering requires real attention on the freeway,  but in general, for what it is intended for, this is what everyone should be driving around town.    I have owned around 50 cars, and this will be the one that will be hardest to let go of.   GREAT WORK FIAT!  And thanks to Fiat of Glendale for making the purchase so easy."
"Zippy Electric Vehicle  The 500e has a better response than the gas-powered version.  It handles better, has the best pickup and go, and is so fun to drive.  I wanted to lease an electric vehicle so I wouldn't have to pay for parking in my city's parking meters and garages (my city has an incentive to lease/purchase EVs) especially as I work downtown and must pay to park.  It's a dream to drive and park, and recharges when you break, so it becomes a game to get as much mileage from a charge as possible.  So far, I've had no problems with the car at all.  The lease is up the end of the year, and I've become spoiled with having an EV; it's wonderful not to pay for gas, oil, or smog check!  I hope to continue with either leasing or owning another EV.  At least in California, this is the way to go especially as the state has a pay back money incentive to own/lease an EV."
"Powerful V6 Pony!  This was my dream car since I was a little boy.Im 20 years old now and ive been wanting this car since it came out!And 8 years later its mine as a High School Graduation present from my parents. For a 3.8l V6 Engine its really fast and powerful.I yet to add a cold air intake and exhuast but even without it it saves a lot of gas and its very fast.Sure it isnt a GT(V8) with 260+HP but how it is now(190HP) its pretty fast.Exterior looks great,A+. Interior is kinda plain,But hey ITS A MUSTANG!!Sound System is great,but since mine was used the original MACH 460 System was taken out before I bought it. I Have A Sony Stereo and its BADASS!This car always turns heads.American Muscle Beats Import!!!!"
Great little gem for the money.  Great little car for short distance commute and travel. Has plenty of space in the backseat even though trunk space is limited. Charging is easy but know that on standard 110V outlet it would take an entire day to charge up. 24V commercial chargers can do the same in 4 hours or you can install a 240V at home. Love the styling and it's a hoot to drive. Instant torque and no shifting makes the car feel like it has way more power than it does. No problem at all passing cars with easy and it handles very well. Slightly wobbly on highway with high wind. One of the best EV out there that drives handles and performance as good with any gasoline vehicle - 500E is better than any other 500 variant including the Abarth IMO.
"WAY more expensive than you can even imagine!!  DO NOT BUY THE FIAT 500e!!  There is a major design flaw that will cost you $2000 at least once, and likely $2000 / year.  This is NOT covered by the warranty.  Before buying one, take a look at the plug (where the gas cap would normally be).  It is very fragile plastic.  Now think that for 8 hours or more a day, this will be plugged into a charger with a handle slightly smaller than a gas pump handle.  Now think that if a small child bumps that even once, the plastic connector will snap.  That simple looking connector costs almost $2000 to replace.  It is part of a cable bundle that runs to the front of the car.  It takes 7 hours to replace (at least that's what they bill).  This will break!!  Beware before buying this car!!  Warranty will not cover it because they say it is the child's fault for bumping into it, not a car problem."
"nice commuter car, but not for a family  If you're single and need something to get from A to B and happen to live in the city with access to a charging station either at home or near a chargepoint (where you have to pay) then this may be the car for you. I am a leasee of this and plan to drive it and give it back at the end of my 3 year stint, but I will have to say that you have to make compromises with this car. PROS/CONS as they come to me. Small, can park anywhere, stable up to about 80mph on highway, with the seats folded down you can fit a wide variety of items. If you have small kids, the back seat is great, if you are tall and an average sized adult you may have a lot of problems.  You also can not carry a golf club bag in the back if you have those seats occupied, maybe just one 3 people in the car and have one seat folded down. Charging at 32A which is the max rated for this car will take about 3.5 hours to charge to full which isn't bad. I use this car to travel back and forth to work at around 35mi away, you can barely make it back. If had to take detours you may be stretching it. I've also noticed that the battery is degrading after driving it hard for about 1 year. If you plan to drive this for longer than 5 years you may not be able to reach the rated 80mi on a single charge. Be prepared to stop or have that charging card ready. With all the short comings, I do enjoy my drive in the car, but with all the SUVs out there if god forbid you get into an accident, you may get out alive, cause there's not many crumple zones. I would highly recommend this car in city situations, but probably look towards volt or battery capable car to get you places. I think my next car will be a bolt because 200mi range is the sweet spot and calms my range anxiety. Cause you know, sometimes you just gotta go far. Many folks will need to have a backup gas car to go further places, but this may be a good interim car. I have no idea why but the insurance on this thing is SUPER expensive in CA, and parts are as well. Factor that in if you ever do get into an accident. Remember guys and gals, EVs are still new and in a few years time you're going to see a lot of choices. My recommendation is to get this car if you need to tie you over or just save up and bye our friend's Elon's brand. Thanks for reading."
"Fun city car, and very manageable in the 'burbs  Giving this a try as a ""mom car.""  The biggest PITA is trying to use standard driving directions.  Yes, highway mileage brings out what's probably the weakest point on the car. I've gotten my mileage estimate up to 110, but that's using my own hybrid of biking directions and knowing my way around both the roads and bike paths after having lived (relatively adventurously) in my city for 20 years.  There's also a driving style adaptation; I'm a chronic speeder, and one of the reasons I got this car was to self-impose restrictions on that.  Simply having the kWh display has been enlightening, to say the least.  (All cars should have some sort of energy-burn display).  If you drive a gas-powered car, be prepared for a change.  It's a good one, but a shift none the less.  ***  For reference, the trunk size with the seats down is about the same size as my old Forester with one huge exception: the angle of the back of the car.  I use my old trunk mat, but height in the back is so seriously lacking I'm thinking of removing the interior of the trunk panel just for the added couple inches.  ***  Visibility from inside the car is why I bought this.  It's not as good as older cars with nice big windows and narrow frames, but it's better than any of the other eCars I drove.  I've given up on being visible to other drivers, frankly, so... this one is great on agility, and the horn is loud enough while still having a polite staccato.  Traction in <4"" of snow, on ice, and in the rain is the best I've owned (but also the newest).  ***  It's really fun.  Charging stations are popping up in new places, I'm saving a car-payment's-worth in gas and oil changes, I can whip a u-turn right on the street and nab a really tiny parking space, and getting service simply having a newer car, even with Chrysler-FIAT, is a whole lot better than trying to fight for cred driving an older car."
"Poorly made vehicle with horrible service  Poorly made vehicle, looked nice in the beginning but after like a year or so of use, things start going horribly. Wheels were worn out with only about 10k of use. and the tires are not cheap. What i was told by a fiat mechanic is that everybody at fiat knows the electric car is heavy and the tires they have don't last that long. If everybody knows, why wasn't i disclosed of this before the lease? If i had known i would need to replace my tires twice during the lease, i would have said no. then the headlights went out on year 2 and had to have those replaced. When i tried to complain about the crazy situation, Chrysler was like, we'll look into it and call you back, never called back, after a while i gave up. Multiple times with customer services and not one time were my problems resolved."
"Great Electric Car. Fun to drive.  I recommend this car to anyone that is looking for a car that feels like it came from the distant future of the automotive industry. We purchased a used Fiat 500e and we are very happy with it. We test drove about 8 Fiat 500e at different dealerships until we found one that we liked. We studied the car and read many reviews before making the choice to buy the car. The battery is the most expensive part of the car and Fiat provides an 8 year or 100,000 mile warranty on the battery."
"Fiat 500e is really fun driving machine  I purchased a used low mileage 2015 Fiat 500e a couple of months ago and was so impressed with how it handles that I purchased another for my sister.  These cars are a real steal on the used car market.  I live in South Florida where it is warm and flat and generally have been getting over 100 miles of range (EPA 87).  A Fiat 500 in general is not the most practical car but if you want something really fun to drive, this is it.   This car handles very similar to my former Mini Cooper but without the gas.  UPDATE:  I'm still very happy with my Fiat 500e after more than one year of ownership.  Additionally, I have had excellent service from the Fiat Dealership (Arrigo) in West Palm Beach, when I have brought the car in for some minor items and software updates which were covered under Warranty."
"FIAT 500E Do NOT BUY or Lease!!  This car is cheaply made. I leased 2015 500e, already the charging cable is broken and the plugin part is loose and the prongs that fit into the outlet is burning y outlet. The house almost caught on fire! Customer service is really bad and could not even tell me if the charging cable is under warranty. My car has only 15K miles!!! It's now in the shop and can't drive it as can't charge it!!!"
"Quirky but Cute EV  Lease terms are great when combined with rebates from California State and Central Valley.   Car is a hoot to drive: fast and responsive with great handling.   It also is cute and sophisticated looking.   Range is about 100 miles in the relatively flat Central Valley.   This car works great as a city commuter and carries our shopping purchases easily in the ""trunk"" and the extra space made by folding down the rear seats.  We are family of two ""empty nesters"" so although this car is an addition to our gas engine vehicles (bought to complement our newly installed solar array on the rooftop), it has become the favorite car to use.   Front seats are fine but rear seats are a bit cramped.  Controls are ""interesting,"" reflecting Italian design!!   The integrated info system in 2016 is a bit improvement over previous models.  In addition, the interior white/black color scheme is practical but classy.   We have had no problem in the city or on the highway.  Beware that this car does not allow Level 3 charging so expect to wait a bit longer for it to charge with Level 2 at public charing stations or a lot longer with the Level 1 charger that comes with the car."
"Great in the city but awful on highway  PROS:  This car is really nimble in the city.  We live in San Francisco so parking is rarely a problem for this car.  This car is great at stop and go.  Often you can drive more than 100 miles in the city.  It has good handling and is fairly comfortable in the front seat.  CONS:  My worst complaint is the highway mileage.  If driving around 65 mph continuously don't expect the range to go beyond 60-70 miles.  Also, when you turn on AC you lose about 10 (estimated) miles in range so be careful.  Back seat is horrible in terms of space.  Trunk space is small but for a family of three it's big enough to hold our weekend groceries.  I like the interior design but the quality of material is really cheap so I don't think it's worth the price tag.  Everyone was laughing at the bright orange but this bright color is necessary because sometimes on the road people just don't see this compact car.  Reliability and safety are unknown at this point since I am not a pro.  Overall I'd recommend this car for short distance commuters."
"Dream Car  I bought my first mustang when I was 16 years old. Now 3 years later I still love this car. Its pretty fast for a V6 after the cold air intake and exhaust, and not that bad on gas. I get commented on my car all the time. Also the mach 460 stereo system, Everyone loves how it sounds. Its the best think I could of ever bought."
"Just drive it  Great commuter car, also a total blast to city drive.  Regenerative brakes are sweet and seem better than conventional, great acceleration, amazing that they make vehicles like this.  The only real downside I noted (aside from a limited range) is that going uphill really drains the batteries fast shortening the range.  That aside, it is really roomy in the front, the back clearly not popular with most.  You buy the EV that suits your needs- as we were looking at a commuter car, this was by far the best choice.Update- three years later, no problems whatsoever."
Peppy car with an excellent MPGe  Great local commute car and for local errands.
"My first used car!  I have always purchased new vehicles so was quite concerned buying a used lease vehicle made by Fiat. But after a six months I am impressed with this little electric car! I decided to investigate leasing an electric while idling my V-8 in commute traffic, and ended up buying this Fiat. With the gas and bridge toll savings this used car will pay for itself in about 5 years, plus reduced wear and maintenance on my Jeep. The biggest downside so far is the lack of Fiat service centers."
"Style is Electrifying  I love the looks and handling. This would make an awesome commuting car; however it would be a little tight for passengers in the back seats. The typical downsides are minimal range (<100 miles), and takes at least four hours to charge from 'empty.'"
"Great fun zero emissions from Italy/Detroit/Mexico  I've had my 500e for a little over 2 years now and still love it. I have a 50 mi commute every work day and probably average another 50 mi each Sat and Sun, in general, and I pay pennies to drive this thing. I charge a mix of at home and at work (free at work from solar unit). I average about 80 miles per charge, but that's because I drive quite hard in my commute, usually going 75-80 mph. When I'm not commuting usually see about 100 miles per charge. The only thing I wish it had was a DC fast charge option, but otherwise very happy with it. Another 50 miles of range wouldn't be a bad thing either! But I'm not complaining, overall quite happy. I've only been ""stuck"" twice and both times I was a block from home and just pushed it into my driveway. When it gets to 0% state of charge, it pretty much means it, you've got about 1 mile left at that point. Also, love burning rubber from a stop, it's very easy to do, and it's funny because there's no engine sound, just the whirring of the electric motor and the squealing tires. Very funny.  I also have a Fiat Abarth which I use on long trips and for fun mountain driving, and the e definitely feels a bit different with all the weight down low, it feels quite planted and Mercedes like (not that the Abarth isn't planted enough)."
"Go dog Go! 500e is fun!  1500 miles on my 500e. Lease $200 month. $2500 total down, $2500 rebate from state of CA. Aero environment 220 charger installed today compliments of State of CA. Est monthly fuel cost to drive 1000 miles approx $35 per SMUD utility rep. 500e total car expenditure less than gas and routine maintenance alone on my MB C230...like winning a free car in a contest. Enough ACCT 101. This little thing is pretty fun. Very spunky and quick off the line. Easily separates from ICE cars off green lights. Great around town car or 2nd car. I drove it 95 miles very gently today and had 10% charge left. Update 35000 miles still having fun..range is about 85-90 miles now..Although mountain travel or heavy rain can really diminishes range...King of the road in stop light to stop light around town stuff...not so fabulous  on the freeway...real cost to operate was about $20 per month at special utility rate offered..no regular maintenance to speak of just keep the tires correctly pressurized."
"Great little car  We bought the car rather than lease it and overall we are very happy with it.The rear seats are very usable except for tall people but we use normally keep the rear seats down.Very zippy; excellent acceleration, specially 0 to 50.I regularly get over 85 highway miles from each charge but YMMV: less if you have the A/C on, more in the city or if you drive less aggressively than meI've driven the gas 500 (not the abarth) and the 500e is significantly more fun than it.We had to deal with the half-shaft recall and some additional teething problems but the fundamentals (electric engine, inverter, battery) all look very good.The car deserves the awards it has received recently."
"Blast to drive  Leased a black model without sunroof in mid-October.With the $2500 the state air resource board is sending me, the net lease cost is about $180/month.I was spending $160 in my Tundra on gas each month.I leased this car for the HOV sticker, and it's priceless.The car is quick off the line, and it surprised me how much acceleration power it has at most speeds under 50mph.I'm 6'4"", and fit not problem.The rear seats only fit kids.It's been freezing weather in NoCal for the past two weeks, so my range has been reduced due to heater and seat warmer on high.My commute is 28 miles round trip, so I can get by plugging it in every other day with the stock charge plug (110v).Luv it!"
"Fiat 500E rocks!  Just leased this. Really impressed with fit, finish and fun to drive performance! Easy to exceed rated MPGe. With sweet lease deal, total cost of car is less than I was spending on gasoline alone, each month. Range is OK, better than others except Tesla and Volt. Getting by with included slooow 120V charge device, others may desire $800 optional fast charger. Costs $1 per day for electricity to drive 40 miles, previous vehicle was $10 per day for gas. Very impressive car, hope future models offer extended range and lower cost batteries. My SUV will last forever, now parked except when needed!"
"The latest Topolino  I would get this car as a second car or as an ""only"" if I lived in the city.  I got it because I always wanted a Topolino since the ""30's.  And I love it!  If you are over average height you had better check its fit."
"Dangerous underpowered rust bucket  The car's interior is a joke.  Cheap, boring plastic.  It was outdated even for 20 years ago.  The V6 is severely underpowered.  Good luck accelerating in 5th gear unless you've got a ton of momentum.  Almost anything over an entry level 4 banger is faster.  In snow, it is undriveable.  In the rain, it is just plain dangerous.  Hydroplanes, and cannot get traction.  The car feels unsafe.  At high speeds, it was bumpy, and felt loosely connected to the road.  The car rusted out completely on bottom. Could pick chunks of rust off the frame.  I sold it to an unsuspecting buyer, who probably will have to part it out or crush it. In the near future.  AC was terrible. Tires go flat"
Great little car  I had my doubt of buying my fiat. It was a great buy I love my car. It drive beautiful and so easy to fit. Love it!!!!!!!
"As good as my GTI Autobahn  Car is wonderful, as much fun as any car I've owned. Enjoy driving it as much as if not more that my GTI. Enough power for this light car. Manual tranny great. Ride and handling great. The Abarths extra power must ,(I have the non turbo) be a real treat in this Italian tomato on wheels. Mine is red,adorable. Highly recommend good quality throughout. On the highway on cruise control doing 60 mpg I’m getting between 42 and 55 mpg. Highly recommend this vehicle. I have the 5 speed manual as stated, not sure how the auto grant performs with this small engine."
"Cutest car ever owned  This car gets so much attention,  convertible, easy to park, good on freeway, surprisingly fun car, runs/drives very good.  Virtually a two seater, they should redo speedo cluster pkg, don't need tach, somewhat confusing overall interior gage itinerary just simplify, no spare tire, AC good, handles well.  Retro look very snappy, not a cheap car.  They don't need rear seat headrests, throw those out, better visibility, has some Chrysler good features, buy one if you can drive a smaller car, however I am 6'2 and @275 lbs, pretty comfortable."
"Most smiles per dollar available!!  I have owned this car for about 8 months and have put just over 6k miles on it.  I drive it daily in city traffic, take it for spirited drives through the mountains, and have taken it to the local track day a few times.  This car has never let me down, had any real issues, or made me regret buying it.  The dealership has been very helpful with the 2 issues I have had(a bad clamp on the A/C condenser and a bad clamp on the coolant overflow reservoir).  I am 6'2"" and simply don't fit in a lot of the sportier cars on the market.  I tried the MX-5, Toyota 86, and Ford Fiesta ST and this was the most comfortable to me and I don't even have to put my seat all the way back to fit!  Incidentally this car is faster than every one of those cars that cost at least a couple grand more.  My 8 year old that is 4 and a half feet tall fits easily in the rear seat and I have room in the hatch for a surprising amount of groceries.  The interior is good quality and I have yet to hear a single rattle or squeak.  The driver's screen is very easy to read and all controls are intuitively placed and easy to reach.  The window controls in the middle throw people off but to me it just makes sense since my hand is already there for the shifter anyway.  Is this the most practical or fastest car....not at all.  Will this car have you looking for any excuse to do a rev-matching downshift and cost you hundreds of dollars in plastic surgery to remove those smile lines....DEFENITELY!"
Looks Cute but no quality  Check with dealer about service-it takes 4 weeks to get appointment to correct engine issue-car two month old have two warning lights-unreliable and poor quality built
"ABSOLUTE WORST Car I Have Ever Owned  Purchased a 2014 Fiat 500 Lounge April 2015 about 1 week after purchase I was going up a hill had stopped at a stop sign, after the stop I accelerated and the car although in drive would not go forward and just drifted back.  I had to wait for traffic to go around me and then drift backward down the hill until i drifted backward into a driveway then drifted forward in drive down the hill until the transmission engaged back into drive.  Over the next 2 months the transmission failed to engage 3 more times each a under different circumstances and each of those times when the transmission did engage the car lunged forward. Each time this happened there was someone in the car with me and once someone else was driving.  I took my car to the dealer and was told they could find no issues.  The problem continued so I called Fiat who advised I take it back to the dealer which I did and the dealer advised again no issues and had a tech from Fiat come into look at it and again they found nothing.  Fiat said there was nothing they could do.  The car is DANGEROUS, I also called Chrysler and got the same results.  Neither FIAT or CHRYSLER was of any assistance and offered no solution perhaps replacing with another car or something, anything ..not that I want another but at least an offer to rectify the situation.  DO NOT PURCHASE A FIAT car is unsafe and Fiat & Chrysler customer service is the worst I have ever had to deal with."
"If this car doesn't appeal to you, you're dead.  Fun. Fun. Fun is what you should know about this car. It feels fun, sounds fun, looks fun, and can be used practically as well.  I've had mine since February, and have put almost nine thousand miles on it in those three months. I'm someone who usually puts less than a thousand miles a month on my car, but this little monster keeps humming to me to drive more, drive faster, drive farther. It's simply the most fun I've ever had on tires. My one complaint as a driver is the manual shifter has a long throw, more like an old tractor than a sporty car, but there are several inexpensive (~$120) aftermarket adapters available that fix that nicely. So go try one. My car's not the quickest, or the fastest, but roll the roof down, blip the throttle, and you'll be caught too. If you aren't, call the undertaker.Update: 14 months in, and I'm not dead yet."
"Very fun to drive!  Update 10/2017: This car has about 40k miles on it now at 3 years old. It has had no maintenance or breakdown issues. Shows no signs of mechanical issues.Some things that do show the wear are the paint. It chips rather easy and is somewhat discolored on the bumper areas, not too noticeable unless your washing it. Resale value of the fiat is still in the tank, even though this is one of the special editions of abarth, which is a bummer and the biggest reason I can not recommend buying this car at any price new. Resale is ATROCIOUSLY low. If you buy it new, you are stuck until the car is 3/4 paid off at least. So the value just isn't there on the financial side and I have had way better value in, well, every other car I have ever owned. Better off with a mini cooper, honda, kia, hyundai or toyota by far. Original reviewI've owned this car for over 2 years when writing this review.The good: This car is fun to drive, its eye catching , and people always comments on the sound of the exhaust.  If your looking for something fun to drive this is a good catch.  The cabrio top is great on non rainy days, really enjoy the air and blasting the sound system, which is ample to blast through any wind noise.The steering and response is there,, it wont disappoint on the steering and grippiness of the road. Once the stock tires wore down I replaced them with Michelen Y rated tires which will last longer.The stick shift is this car is super easy,, you wont have a problem even if your a novice. And the hill assist is money. If your on a hill and need to go from 1st gear, no need to rev the engine and grind the clutch, the car holds break for you for about 3-4 seconds which is plenty to get going (really nice feature) and if its not your thing, you can turn it off in the settings.Interior: its a unique design for Fiat so theres not much in the Fiat line to compare it to,, its a nice leather finish to the seats and really compliments the white exterior. I get lots of compliments on the interior design.Gas milage will vary depending on how you drive it,, if your enjoying that punchy turbo motor,, expect gas milage to suffer,, if your easy on it,, it'll realistically be in the mid to high twenties maybe get into 30s.Parking assist is money and works as advertisedAll the controls are easy to use, reach and understand.If you want to know some cons:Might second biggest gripe would be the stock radio head unit. Its really cheap garbage. Which is sad because this car is priced high when compared to what you get in other brands for mid-high 20k range. I replaced it with a Kenwood KVT7012BT, which is the best thing you can do. Not only does it allow you to adjust the EQ the fidelity, apps, screen size and capability is just better. Sound is well improved. The Beats system is junk and is pure marketing for beats, the consumer is benefiting nothing from this system.Second gripe would be the headlight power,,  the illumination is underwhelming and in many cases will have you wondering if your seeing everything you need to be.There are some blind spots with the front windshield pillars which when in a lengthy turn scenario have blinded me to cars that were there so you have to have your head on a swivel when taking corners to ensure there is no one coming head on.Resale value on these cars is terrible!!! The number 1 reason I wont purchase again. If you buy it be prepared to keep it for many years.I do find myself wishing for some illumination around the interior at night. Even grabbing a drink from a cupholder can be difficult when its pitch black in the car, so some subtle illumination like the mini has would be stellar. Especially since this car isnt too far off the pricing of a mini.It really is a decent car I wish I could recommend. I have had zero issue with it mechanically. I had a family of four in it without issue cruising around. And taken several trips with 2-3 people in it."
Great little car!  This is so much fun to drive.
"Used Abarth is a perfect second car- Update  Update March 28, 2018 - After owning it approx. 2.5 years, my 2014 Fiat 500 Abarth has proven to be a great second car. It has about 36,000 miles and remains very fun to drive and completely reliable.  That is good because the local FIAT/Jeep/Dodge/Chrysler dealer service department is very, very bad.  Oil changes are done about once per year according to the maintenance minder light on the dash and they cost about $80 (full synthetic is required).  It's due for spark plugs (every 3 years or 36k miles) and the dealer charges over $300 for that service!  I bought the plugs online for about $10 ea. and will change them myself when the weather warms up.  Gas mileage remains 30+ overall and I drive the car pretty hard.  The interior and the exterior are both holding up well and the car still looks great.  The 500 is criticized for it's interior plastic, but that plastic is basically indestructible.  The car is plenty comfortable for a road trip for two 6' tall people and their luggage.  Plenty of room in the front seats. The Abarth handles interstate highways just fine, but it clearly prefers winding secondary roads.  The engine sounds great all the time and I never get tired of running through the gears.  Backroads and 4th gear are a perfect match!  A new 500 Abarth can be had for about $20k, but I'd recommend buying a used one with low miles for just over half the price of a new one.  The 2018 model is essentially identical to the 2015 model and even that was basically the same as the 2012 model.  The 5 year 50k mile bumper-to-bumper warranty should put to rest any reliability fears, but my Fiat 500 Abarth has been surprisingly reliable and trouble free.  However... as much as I love the Abarth, if Honda ever decides to make a Honda Fit Si (with an inch more front legroom please), I'd probably sell the Fiat and buy the Fit Si.  A sportier Fit would be a perfect fit for all my needs since it is much more flexible than the 500."
Lemon Mustang  Nice styling car and fun to drive when it is not heading back to dealership for unending mystery electrical problems.  I have had to many problems with this car to ever want another sports car again.  Couple that with a dealership that wants to nickel and dime you on warranty work makes for bad Ford business.  Not a practical car to own in the winter time in Colorado Springs.    
"Simple Car... Still fun!  I have not had any major work done to my car since I bought it early 2004 used.  I've never been stranded anywhere and we have been doing our own usual maintenance ourselves, no professional work other than smog testing, which it passes easily.   I have just started feeling the shifting become harder, and as an ex- owner of a '92 hatchback Mustang (both are automatics) it's to be expected as my milage is nearing 100,000."
"Horrible!!!  I bought this car with 12,000 miles.  At 70,000 miles here is a list of repairs and cost. Headlights went out, cost over $800.00 to repair, had to replace some electrical board. License plate light is out , cost over 300.00 to replace. Manual transmission it is hard to shift. There was a recall still hard to shift. Had to replace the stick shift boot because the base came a part.  And, the thing about the stick shift boot is it was replaced with a a very nice high quality boot that I had to pay for. Now at 77,000 miles the left boot is torn another $800.00 plus to replace. I have had more issues with this car but don’t have time to keep going. This car is of poor quality. Everything is put together with plastic clips.  My suggestion, find another cute car. Fiat sales are down, and the reason is this car is a piece of junk! Don’t waste your time."
"Mr Blue  I was a little hesitant on buying this car as to some of the reviews and actually I bought it used but the bottom line is that I love it ! I now have 100,000 miles on it and other than routine maintenance ,oil changes ,tune up etc. It has never let me down ! I travel 50 miles a day to and from work and love the great fuel economy at about 38.5 miles per gallon at about 60 mph ! Also the Bose stereo rocks ! All in all no complaints but thinking of maybe going with the 4 door version if I purchase another ."
"A Pop of fun  I highly recommend the manual version, it's just more fun to drive, better mpg and less wear and tear on the transmission...the Engine is zippy and responsive, the steering light, and the size is tiny! The car weighs 2400 lbs...forget the back seats, it's for kids and small pets lol...first thing I did was an oil change, rear wiper blade and interior cabin filter..."
Her name is Dot  My brown Fiat was totaled and I didn’t want to go with with a new car or a different brand. I loved my car and I wanted a stick shift. I found Dot in Marin and she’s beautiful (black and white) and I just love driving her. She’s fast and I feel very safe. Fiat is a car company I will stick with. I even got the same year as my previous car.
"Cute is never enough  I bought this car because my aunt had one and because it was so cute. This car has broken more times than my previous car which had almost 200,000 miles on it, I owned that one for 8 years and I've had the Fiat for 5. I did all of the scheduled maintenance, even after my warranty ran out. I have had to replace...the oil pressure sensor, the throttle position sensor, the thermostat, the alternator, the windshield wash reservoir, and I'm on my second replacement O2 sensor.  Inside the cable that moves the front passenger seat up and forward at the same time didn't last the first year, and I don't have kids so it was used that often. The fuses for the climate controller lighting have been replaced several times. The daytime running lights are nearly impossible to get to to replace the bulbs. The holders for the felt covered section that covers the cargo area broke within the first few months.  The car handles really well in the snow though, when it can get out of it's own way. It's annoying that you can't open the back hatch unless you unlock it with the keyfob, There's no button inside the car and no keyhole outside. If you get out of your car and run around to the back to get something you have to shut the car off to unlock the back hatch. Although it is nice that it's set up so you virtually cannot lock your keys in the car. The keyfob mangles really easily, like just from regular use. Right now we are trying to figure out why nothing happens when I put the pedal to the floor uphill on the highway. Oh and if your thermostat goes the car will try to kill you by registering an overheat that isn't happening which throttles the engine back without warning. Then after it has it's fit everything goes back to normal. Lastly the repair costs will put you in the poor house and dealer parts are almost always on back order."
Fiat sport turbo  Only had it a short time but love turbo and handling.
"Extra warranty takes me to 1M miles!  This car has been driven nearly 7 days a week almost every week, for 5.5 years.  Once a year, an oil change is called for, the car will show the warning for that when it is time.  We put a little over 8K miles on it per year, and as this writing, we are at 44K.  This is a base model, no special wheels, just a basic pop.  Aside from once a year oil changes, and scheduled maintenance, the following things have required repair - 1) the wiring harness that connects all things powered to the hatchback had to be replaced.  2) the fan switch for the heating/cooling needed to be replaced 3) and the rear oil seal on the engine began a tiny drip, which was deemed necessary to be replaced.  All of this would have fallen outside of the warranty, but I purchased the 1M mile bumper to bumper warranty.  Per visit, with the extra warranty, there is a $100 plus tax fee.  The above repairs, if I had not had the warranty, would have almost equaled the cost of the warranty!!!  So, since we drive the wheels off of cars, we will be in great shape going forward.  Really, get an additional warranty with your purchase if it is possible.  On another topic, some observations.  I am a big guy, I fill up the front seat, but this is not uncomfortable and I have driven it as far as 10 hours in one day with no suffering or ill effects.  The handling of the vehicle in snow, ice or rain is phenomenal for a small car.  Phenomenal.  I use the auto shift and move from one gear to the other myself right at 2400 rpm.  This gets you the best gas mileage.  Summer, air on, 32+/42+, fall and spring is 33+/45, dead of winter, as in under 15 degrees day after day, 31.6/42.  My drive is boring so I keep myself occupied with mpg games and metal music.  If you look at the maintenance schedule you will notice that very little needs be done, and the maintenance is very far apart too.  Love that.  To fill it up is around $20-22+.  So low.  Forget fuel cells.  Forget battery powered vehicles too.  Sit down and calculate it all, as I did, and the cost per month is almost the lowest of any car on the market.  Change the air filter once a year, don’t bother with high octane fuel, as I tested that and the economy and performance were unchanged, and buy the car.  Surprisingly, when the seats are folded forward in the rear, the car can hold a week’s worth of groceries back there!  It is really large back there I am serious.  However, if you have to people in the backseats, think again!  Short trips, sure.  But that is it.  It looks great, is fun to drive, and has tons of airbags, of course ABS and the electronic wheel control system, so there.  Not perfect, certainly not for everyone, but the fuel economy, the safety, stopping power, and the HUGE warranty make this a pick that works for me and my wife."
"A smile that lasts a lifetime  First off, my car was purchased on a whim I didn’t do any research before buying it. I didn’t need the car as I already had an suv. I was bored one day drove down to the Fiat store and the rest is history. I bought a 2015 brown fiat 500 pop. 101 hp, now it does feel underpowered in automatic mode, but I drive it in the manual mode all the time and I get better response time. So I think 101hp is manageable. I commute between towns which is about 90 miles one way. I average 36mpg on the commute! Bout $20-25 fills the tank which gets me about 364 miles give or take. The engine is stock for now, I am playing with the idea of trading it in for an Abarth. However, for what the pop offers, it’s a solid car! I use the pump under the drivers seat all the time to fill my tires with air, I love the convenience of this on board pump. Blue tooth is very handy to have when driving. I feel safe driving the car, it handles turns like a go cart! Plenty of storage with the back seat down. I fit a 55” tv in it once for a local move I made, desperate times call for desperate measures! Cup holders are a bit annoying, but it’s a small car, so I guess this is the best I’ll get out of the car. Vehicle is cheap on repairs! If your mechanically inclined like me, you can save money doing things yourself. I get comments all the time, regarding how cute it looks, or how does it handle, is it good on gas? I would for sure buy the car again! I have not been stranded once other than to replace the battery. Ac blows cold and quick, it does help to have tinted windows. I also have a VW Golf TDI, which our performs my fiat, and gets better mpg, but whenever I drive my fiat there is just this smile I get  that’s lasts a lifetime!"
"Better than a Honda  Very reliable. No mechanical issues. A great, fun little car. Tony hasn't even had to fix it once! If FIAT keeps making them like this, poor Tony's going to go broke."
"Looks aren't everything  I bought this car used at two years old with 24,000 miles. The car runs well and has not given me any engine trouble thus far. The problem with this car is that it is cheaply made. For example the first to happen was that the plastic hubcaps broke off and rolled away while I was driving it and all in a short period of time from one another. The rear view mirror started wobbling and bobbing while I was driving. We've now had to rig it to stay still. I won't touch it in fear that it will brake. The armrest has zip ties holding it in place. The ""leather"" thing to the shifter is not attached to the base anymore. And the worst thing is that the front vents to the air conditioner do not work anymore. It is like they're blocked. We have that rigged, as well, to have some air conditioning considering we live in the desert. To add to the vents not working the instrumentation for the air conditioning is faulty and now only has a choice of 2 speeds (1 and 3) and off. I cannot wait to get rid of this vehicle,  but I will be upside down on it when I trade it in because what I owe is more than what it is worth."
"Very fun, very reliable  This is the third Mustang I have owned, and all I can say is that all three have been vey reliable, and the 2000 model has been the best I've owned. I'm well past the 100,000 mile mark and all I have had to do for repairs is replace the low pressure cutoff switch for the a/c (all of $30)."
Cute little car for pasta lovers  Fun little car
"Fix It Again Tony  The car performs relatively well only under warranty. Soon after warranty is over, everything brakes and is very expensive to fix it."
"Love it so far!  I fell in love with Fiats after my trip to Italy and have wanted one ever since. After being super unhappy with Honda, I traded in for a Fiat. As a college student who works a lot and commutes, I put a lot of miles on my cars, relatively quickly. I've had my Fiat for nearly a year and have put on about 10,000 miles on it (now has about 50k miles) and absolutely no problems so far. I don't think it's THAT comfortable of a ride, but it's not uncomfortable. I feel safe in it. It's very responsive. Stereo sounds good. I was really looking for something cost effective and it fits the bill. It costs $15-20 to fill my gas tank which I love. The only issues I have with it are minor. The bluetooth button is annoying, I don't use it and my hand always seems to hit it while steering. And the blinker is a little wonky. I'll have my blinker going left or right, take my turn, and many times it wont turn off so I'll manually put it in the middle to stop blinking, but instead, the opposite blinker goes off. I don't know if it's just my car or a known problem, but it's a pretty minor complaint. I just feel like anyone driving behind me probably thinks I'm crazy when I have my left blinker on, then right after my right blinker may turn on until I can get it to stop blinking. Otherwise, great little car with a lot more space than it looks like from the outside. I love throwing the backseats down and having tons of room. A lot of people stare at it wherever I am because there aren't a whole ton of Fiats around, which is cool. Great commuter car, I truly enjoy it and would recommend it."
"What a Gem!  I bought my 2012 Fiat with a standard transmission to make a 120 mile round trip daily. The ONLY complaint I have, is the comfort of the seat after extended driving. Of course this could be due to my age, but I'm going to blame it on the length of the seat. The only work I have had to do on the car is the standard oil changes (get ramps, you'll need them to get under this car), new tires and the license plate light went out. That was fairly costly, as you can't just replace the bulb. The entire handle had to be replaced.  I was averaging 41 MPG but since I have just been using it to dart around town, the mileage has dropped to 38.2 MPG.  I love, love, love this little car!"
"Poor service, good car  While the electric car is great, we broke a windshield badly. The car hasn't been drivable for 6 months and we are expected to pay our lease. Not very customer friendly. Things still aren't resolved so we still don't have a car and Fiat doesn't give a darn."
"Great Vehicle for What it Is  If you are looking at a vehicle large enough to haul the family or a trendy sports car with lots of power then the FIAT 500 Pop is not your vehicle. But if you are looking for a small, comfortable, affordable ride for you and your significant other then the 500 Pop is a perfect purchase. The 500 Pop is surprisingly powerful off the line, shifts smoothly, rides quietly even at 85-90 MPH, and gets great MPG. It is more roomy and comfortable up front than expected. It is, obviously, a little cramped in the back. While the hatch allows you to fit most anything you need, keep in mind that it is not the perfect vehicle for packing all of your worldly possessions. Just know understand what you are buying and you will not be disappointed."
Eye Catcher  The car is small but it is great on gas and it serves it purpose. If I get another car it will be a Fiat I love the car.
"Looks aren't everything...  I purchased the car in 2012, brand-new,and wish I hadn't.  First off, the car  randomly powered off (the engine stopped, all the lights turned off, it just turned off!)  well making a slight left turn on a very hot day. I went to the mechanic they said it was a fluke. Next,  the car  light turned on but the car wouldn't, the engine light all of the dashboard lights turned on, but the car wouldn't start. We managed to get the car running, drove 30 miles to the dealer where we purchased this Fiat (in Ontario California),  and ritual by the mechanics to leave it overnight so they can check it out. Four days later  The dealer calls us and tells us on the car needed was a new battery (the car was still under warranty, and the battery was covered). Shortly thereafter (our warranty expired), The dashboard lights will turn on and the car had trouble starting. It was mellow at first, taking a couple of key turns to get the car running...until one day the car just stopped running. We got it to the mechanic,  this time we went to the dealership in Riverside, and they told us there was a leak, and it was dripping on the starter. They let us know it would be OK but that we needed to take care of the leak and possibly get a new starter. We drove the car home, less than 10 miles, and it completely stopped running.  Now we have to take it to get towed to the dealer, pay close to $1200 to get it fixed (and that's if they don't find any other crazy thing going on with the stupid car). Every time I see a Fiat in the freeway or on the street, I get a stomachache. This is the most unreliable car ever."
"little one  Roomy enough inside for 2 average adults,simple radio with steering wheel controls ,mine has the power sunroof,really nicedont see alot these in brooklyn ny awesome city car,parking is pretty much point and park.Power is not the best ,but runs better on 93 octanein sport mode and helps that its a 5speed manual.If you want a  2 door compact car thats simple and goes a long way on 15 bucks of gasand isnt a mini or smart car,this ones good."
"Little Red Cherry Pepper  Car's great to me. Single guy, and tall, and car is fun, dependable and has just enough bells and whistles for me: bucket seats, great stereo, good heat/ac... I get more compliments on this car than I did on my mini-cooper. Maybe it's the rosso brilliant paint... Going on fourth year and hope to have for many yrs more... 21k so far, and always excited to get bend the wheel and go for a ride... For the price paid, I'm happy..."
"6 years of racing and daily driving  First off let me say I love this car, with the exception of a few things. I really hate the market value, so this one will stay with me 25k paid for a fully loaded GT...Now I can sell according to KBB 7k....that part stinks. I have done some performance work to my car (pullies, gears, exhaust w/o cats, cold air intake, and chip) so far I have had no problems with anything mechanical. I have replaced parts that are considered normal wear and tear (struts, shocks, and springs) at 100k.I still get a lot of compliments on my car now so the body design is holding up well. The interior could be made better, the door pieces break easily and the weather stripping on the door has been replaced 4 times."
"Never Buy a Fiat! Worst Investment  Good afternoon all,To anyone reading this I hope this review helps you in not repeating the same mistake I have made with this affiliation. Although Fiats are cute in shape there are so many future faults. I currently own a 2012 Fiat 500c Lounge. When I purchased my car Certified Pre-owned at 23k miles I was provided with a car report which only stated car went in for routine maintenance. Fast forward to about 10k miles later I have to get a new battery, tune up etc. I thought nothing of it. I am currently at 58k miles and 8k out of warranty and my transmission light comes on randomly one day stating ""check transmission - see handbook"". I contacted the Fiat customer service (1-888.242.6342 spoke with Robin, Brenda, Mercedes & Josh -Total Calls 8) to see if they could assist with any repairs. They advised me my car history states my fiat has been sent in twice for a new radiator and once for sunroof repair (No wonder previous owner traded it in. A new radiator was installed first 2k miles no accidents just manufacture faults. I had NO prior knowledge of this issue it was never reported nor communicated to me when purchasing). Brenda, then stated they would need it to be diagnoses first to see what they can do. However, in order to do so I would need to take it into the fiat studio etc. Fiat Studio address: 196 South Dupont Highway Newcastle, DE phone no: 3023231666 service advisor: Tony - not helpful had no clue what was going on just guessing games. I was charged a total of $460 just for them to tell me an incomplete, inconsistent diagnosis (Diagnosis code P0741 had been provided to them at drop off before any work was performed - Tony said that was not helpful could mean anything. (Diagnosis means: Torque Converter Clutch Circuit Performance or Stuck Off). Since Fiat customer service said they needed additional details I told ""Tony the unhelpful"" he would need to provide additional details which is why my initial price sky rocketed from $99.95 (because I had a coupon original price $115.97) to $460. The only diagnosis I was provided was that it was a mechanical issue and repairs would be $5,975 (no lie I will never forget this number). In order to get a better understanding because I am a female and cars aren't my forte'. I asked ""Tony the Unhelpful"" what can cause these kinds of issues? He stated its a computer issue and would need rewiring. I provide this feedback to Fiat customer service  who now state since I am out of warranty theres nothing they can do. I understand that, however they should've advised me that before I went ahead and authorized Tony to do absolutely nothing but fiddle around with gadgets? The customer service gave me the impression I would be covered. I have begged, pleaded, cried, went to FCA customer service only to be directed back to Fiat customer service. I even asked that they at least cover half of the diagnosis due to useless customer service as well as mechanical faults. They continuously stated ""no"". In the mist of all of this I still remained optimistic. I continuously attempted to find the root to this problem. I thought maybe this could've have been due to water. I then contacted my insurance company who then performed an extensive investigation and stated after careful review there was no evidence of water damages - claim denied. I contacted the Fiat to advise them of this and also advise that I was told ""this is a mechanical issue"". Fiat Customer Service then states ""Carmen Chrysler Jeep Dodge"" told them my car was ""maintained poorly and it was water damaged"". (My car has a low tire thread on left side everything else is in great shape I promise). I advise the rep of this and also advise her there were no signs of water damages after my insurance performed their investigation. She then contacts shop to verify they then agree that yes in fact the only thing is the tire and confirm no water damage. Fiat still advises me there still nothing they can do since I am out of warranty. They advised that it was my fault since the tire is low it impacted my transmission. I am perfectly fine with that response. I will take full responsibility if that was indeed the case however, that was NOT the case!! After further research and second opinion from AAMCO turns out it was a system issue / computer issue - Mechanical failure the tires had absolutely NOTHING to do with this mechanical failure in fact AAMCO was $300+ cheaper (they waive diagnostic fee if you repair issue). This was all caused by a fault in the transmission so to wrap this review up my Fiat was a complete LEMON when it was first installed. I was lied to upon purchase information was never placed on carfax if it had been I would have NEVER joined the Fiat family because this is a common issue that I had no idea about until now. In conclusion, I would advise anyone seeking a fiat or even going for servicing at this location especially females to look elsewhere. For interested fiat lookers look elsewhere bad c"
"Don't buy a Fiat  Don't buy a Fiat because they don't stand behind their products!!!!! I purchased a used 2012 Fiat Pop May of 2014. In June of 2014 it needed a new purge valve solenoid and had a rotted transmission ground strap. The vehicle at that time had 54,274 miles on it. It had to go to the dealership in Johnston RI to be repaired. In December 2015 I had to replace a broken motor mount. My mechanic also stated that the control arm needs to be replaced. He called the dealership in Johnston RI and was told the parts on the 2012 control arm had been replaced with what the 2013 Fiat has because of poor engineering and that we would have to buy 2 lower ball joints, axles and knuckle bearings. The cost 1,800 not including labor. He asked if it was a recall and was told it was not. They advised him that if the vehicle was still under warranty and under 60,000 miles they would cover it. My anger comes from that vehicle would have been covered had the dealership done the right thing when the car was there in 2014. They knew at that time those parts were faulty. January I broke down and needed to be towed because of the Alternator and battery. February I need a thermostat, sensor and housing. What next???? I called Fiat to complain and all they could say over and over again “The cost of parts denied and the vehicle is out of warranty””!!!! I'm not asking about reimbursement on all the other repairs. They just need to do the right thing and stand behind the faulty parts when they knew it was an issue. Not to mention you can only get the parts from the dealership and they are rude and difficult to deal with. The cost I just shelled out for the alternator 389.70 and battery 155.69. Total for that repair with labor 741.98. I purchased the vehicle for 9,000 after my trade in. I am so angry I just want to get rid of this vehicle but can’t. I still owe 6,000 on it and when I looked up the Kelly blue book the car is worth 3,000. All I want is for them to repair this control arm issue with no cost to me and they won’t!!!!! Learn from me and before you buy do lots of research. The parts are very expensive and the dealership and customer service are sneaky and very rude to deal with."
"Coming up on 4 yrs of ownership  Love the car, but hate the quality - and depreciation.  Purchased new for HS graduate in May 2012.  Rear bumper reflector just dropped off randomly - covered under warranty.  Shift knob top broke off - covered under warranty.  Steering clunk - tightened but not replaced with correct new intermediate shaft under warranty - clunk is back, but now 2 thousand miles out of warranty.  Arm rest broke - cushion fell off - fixed my self with gorilla glue.  Sun roof does not work - and pealed paint on strip in front of sun roof ( for over 20 months ) - but out of warranty - as I had no access to car since daughter had it at college.  I am deathly afraid the clutch will die per other reviews - we have 54000 miles on the car.  I do my own oil and filter changes as dealership service shop is only open during week and my daughter only comes home on weekends.  Having said all that - the car is fun to drive with great brakes and decent enough acceleration for a guy who grew up in a time when zero to 60 in 10 seconds was considered fast.  I asked dealership to make me an offer for trade in to purchase a used car off the lot ( Korean or Japanese ) - and even they don't want the car.  NO offer.  Paid 21K for it and now worth less than 7 K I expect for trade in.  The Bose stereo is awesome.   Gas mileage driving highway is above 38 mpg at 75 mph, so decent - but bigger cars get that now days.  Would I buy again - no - way - ... will I keep it - probably will take it over and keep as 3rd car.I'm 6 foot 2 and just barely stay under the (broken) sunroof - so I can live with it - driving position is strange, but I am used to it.  I like the car - I hate the quality and/or lack of responsibility by Fiat / Chrysler for standing behind the product for the following issues - Steering rack clunk / Paint peeling / arm rest - can't comment on the Sun Roof other than I read it was glued in from the interior and there is no way I'm paying for that repair."
"Originally Excited, Now Regretting Purchase  2012 Fiat:  43,208 miles - Automatic Trans.Purchased July/August 2014 from a seedy local dealership whom can't be held accountable for this ""Lemon"".  It drives GREAT, when it's working but I live in the U.P. of Michigan.  Hard winters are common and the car doesn't have much clearance (which I knew purchasing the car and wasn't worried).  However, the digital displays do not work after 20 degrees (and in the winter that is normally -20 degrees).  25 minutes is usually how long i had to run the car to warm up the car enough for the digital displays to work properly (which wouldn't be bad except the accurate speedometer is digital).   When I first logged on to their online service/maintenance report- I had seen that it was in for electrical work (I believe) twice, and did not think anything of it at the time.  However, around Thanksgiving of that same year I had to send my car to the car dealership in Traverse City for work to be done.  I did not get my car back until late December 2015 because the parts were out of stock.  The customer service department was very nice about the delay, and towing to the customer service department was paid by the Fiat brand because it was under warranty (I paid for bridge tolls $50.00).  I had to make arrangements to get a ride to Traverse City to pick up my car because they were going to charge me to bring it back. The dealership in this area that sold me the car, Fernelius Hyundai, would not help me in the slightest besides giving me a lender car for three days around Thanksgiving- they said it was my problem and I should be thankful for their generosity. When I received my car it worked fine, but then in February of 2015 the same thing happened again.  I received free towing to Traverse City, and I had to pay bridge tolls again.  This time customer service in Traverse City said they couldn't find the problem, but it seemed to be working fine (my theory was that since it is warmer in Traverse City they didn't have the same issue). Now it is January 2016, we had a warmer than normal winter.  AGAIN, I have the same problem with my Fiat.  I again will have to send it down to Traverse City to get it worked on, however, I don't believe it will fall under the 4 year warranty/50,000 miles.  This means I will probably have to pay for the towing and bridge tolls out of pocket.I cannot in good mind sell my car.I believe Fernelius Hyundai knew of these problems. I no longer have access to the previous service records on my car that I can tell.  I believe I have no protection in this but want to try. I can't believe there isn't a recall on my 2012 Fiat after having the same problem YEARLY."
Bang for the buck.  It will get you to your destination perhaps not the most modern or stylish you can go anywhere . Stay on top of the maintenance schedule and if you keep in mind your not the fastest or coolest you can outlast them and pass more then a few  too.
"Clutch broke at 53,000km  Clutch broke at 53,000km, 4 months after the end of 3 year warranty.Cost of repair was CAD 1,800.Called Fiat Canada customer support, they did not want to reimburse."
"I Hate to Say It, But...  As much as I love it, it's got to go.Bought used with about 40K miles on it. It's fun to drive, gets great mileage, and I had no complaints until I went to have the oil changed and the mechanic told me there were metal particles in the oil, and I shouldn't be driving it. I bought it from CarMax, who have been wonderful about dealing with this: ended up having to replace the engine (no cost to me), but when the car came back after being gone for a month, the antennae had been broken off (and not replaced) and one of my hubcaps was missing (again, CarMax is being great about repair/replacement).Came out a week ago to drive to church, and the driver's side door handle came off in my hand. Not a big thing, but a) I live in Wisconsin, where it gets pretty cold, and it was very temperate the night before-not like it was well below freezing and therefore brittle, and b) This car doesn't even have 50,000 miles on it yet.I'm now wondering ""what next"" every time I get in the car to drive it. It makes me sad, because I've really loved this car. Too bad Fiat can't make something more reliable..."
"I'm not sure if my story will have a happy ending  As I write this, my car currently has just over 52,000 miles on it and just recently came off of warranty. It's a 2012 Pop 500, which is now three years old. Last January, I got in it to go to work one morning, and could not get it into gear. This baffled me, as it was perfectly fine the day before. Turns out, I had to have it towed to the dealership and they claimed that a bearing wore out in the clutch kit and an entirely new clutch kit had to be installed. At that time, the car was two - I've NEVER heard of such a thing and was horrified! The service manager was vary vague in answering any questions. Fast forward to this Holiday weekend...my daughter and I were headed out for breakfast in honor of my Birthday, when suddenly, the 'new' clutch blows in the middle of a busy city street, leaving us stranded with people honking and waving their arms madly behind us. This time, the car was stuck in first gear, the clutch would not engage and I was in a panic. We finally managed to push it out of traffic to a safe spot to wait for the tow truck. The kicker this time is that my beloved dealership, where I bought the car and have had it faithfully serviced for three years is closing it's doors on Monday!!! This left me having my car towed 15 miles south to a huge dealership that I've never dealt with before, whose online reviews for service are nothing short of appalling. Let me recap by saying that I thought I selected my car very carefully. I have absolutely loved an adored it, even though I've replaced both headlights (they are not cheap!) and tail lights and more hubcaps than I can count by now. I can live with those petty annoyances, but what really concerns me is that I have 16 months left to pay on this car, and the THIRD clutch is being installed this week. For the record, I baby my car, and most certainly do not beat up on my clutch. In fact, I'm hoping how someone can explain how a bearing gets sheared off, resulting in a brand new kit being installed, then the clutch plate gives way in the brand new kit, 10 months later. Looks like I'll be trading in my car as soon as it's paid off! I lack the words to express how incredibly disappointed I am. The WHOLE reason I bought a brand new car was so that I did not have to deal with maintenance problems like this. VERY, VERY POORLY DONE, FIAT!"
"Totally Disappointed! Hell on Wheels  This is the worse car I've ever had. Since day 1, the dashboard isn't happy unless there is an indicator light on! It's always something wrong with the car, things that should hardly ever go wrong. The headlamps are always needing repair. It's a three year old car and already I've had the engine worked on 3 times, all lights replaced, a new airconditioner put in, the starter went out and that was over $500.00 in repairs, and most recently the gear switch cord broke...another $500.00 repair. I'm afraid to drive it and unfortunately I still have 2-3 years of payments to make on this car. I'm so very sad I trusted the good reviews and the commercials saying how great the car is. As far as fuel consumption..I pay just as much as if I had a larger car. I bought the car to help save money, help support dealers in in America and to have an economical car while I'm going through a low paying job transition and it has made me late with all my bills because of always needing repairs. I need a miracle to get me out of this car. so disappointed. I'm in tears writing this review.  Don't buy one and don't listen to all the great ratings...because after your warrentee runs out, it's Hell on wheels."
"50,000 that's it!  Warranty stops at 50k miles and that's when everything thing fails! You buy the car with a maintenance package.... They will change oil every 8,000 miles (factory recommended)... 500 miles out of warranty and engine light comes on... Now the story changes... Change oil  every 5,000 miles!"
"Ford dies fast  I initially bought this car brand new in 2000, and it was awesome. However, it quickly started to have some serious issues. I had to replace the alternator at 45K, and the rear end work at 55. My check engine light was on for 3 years, after multiple repeated attemts at fixing it finally was fixed. I had an Escort before the Mustang, and it had similar reliability issues.  My next car will be a Honda or Toyota."
"Urban Vehicle  I live in the Seattle area which means tight parking spaces and little maneuvering room. The Fiat 500 is an urban vehicle by definition. It is half the size and weight of a Ford F 150. The Fiat 500 works good for its design purpose. The five speed transmission (manual) is as smooth shifting as they come.I have had a speaker blow out in one of the doors. The Blue and Me full functions are a joke as the program only works for Microsoft phones.  Visibility is excellent.  The doors are very wide making getting in and out easy. And finally, the car always has a smile on the grill.I notice time and again people smiling back at the car and children turning around for a second look. The Fiat 500 is fun to drive.UPDATE: While getting my oil changed at the Fiat dealer a red with bright green wheels Fiat Pop 500 came into the service center. The owner needed a new wiper blade. His car had 123,000 miles on it with no major problems.--> At 19000 miles transmission pressure plate and transmission synchro started to fail and I got a factory recall notice for a problem related to clutch failures. My Fiat 500 Pop was a cute car but I traded it. I replaced it with a 2016 KIA Rio and a 100000 mile, 10 year warranty.  My Fiat days are over.<--Safety: The little Fiat places the vehicle occupants in serious danger in a rear end collision as there is nothing to crumple. The little Fiat is cute but with all the distracted cell phone driverson the road, a rear end hit is a high probability."
"2012 Fiat 500 pop  I love my fiat its adorable inside and out and gets me where I want to go. Due to the wide trunk we are actually able to fit a lot in the back of my fiat with the back seats down including our lawn mower. I have had to replace my windshield several times due to rocks hitting the windshield while driving in highways due to fiat being so low to ground. I also think the windshield glass is not strong as the rocks were not too big and I was far from the trucks. Another issue I had was my hubcabs continuously fall off, I paid for two and then decided to stop paying for them and have had one missing for 9 months now as I refuse to pay for another. The clock in my car is always wrong, small detail yes but annoying, as I have fixed it to the correct time a dozen times and it weirdly keeps going back to 7 minutes behind schedule. The inside of the car is very hard to clean including the steering wheel and dashboard due to the texture and different finishes. It either doesnt clean it at all or leaves streaks, I have tried a bunch of different cleaning products at this point. The ride is beyond bumpy, my friends who have ridden in the car have stated that it feels like they are on a carnival ride. The back seats are not comfortable at all and not full side seats, so if you want that dont get a fiat. The front seat  surprisingly has a lot of leg room per my husband. The car is easy to drive and park and gets great gas mileage. I have people asking me about my car and peering in the window all the time. Its an adorable car and fun to drive but definitely has it drawbacks."
"Trading in  I got a letter for a blow out sale so I drove my Fiat to the dealership and I was fortunately able to get a new loan for a 500L.  I got a great deal on the new car but the trade in on my 2012 Fiat Pop was really low due to issues pertaining to the clutch and the engine noise.  After reading some other reviews I am apparently not the only one with these issues.  Someone else had to get a new clutch under 40,000 and mine has only 34,000. Also another review complained about changing spark plugs and their costs at an early mileage. I just had to replace mine. The engine noise just got so loud in the last few months - out of nowhere.  Service kept telling me it is a Fiat.? Again in another review the engine noise gave them a headache. Then there is the electrical.  Tire monitor light went on after 15,000, some sort of electrical problem.  I had the same problem mentioned in a review. I was constantly checking my air pressure.  Service couldn't help. They just would check the air pressure and say it is fine.  I had to replace both headlights at 34,000, also mentioned in another review and of course replacing the hub caps two or three times a year at $55.00 a piece.  Hope I have better luck with the 500L. Risky getting another Fiat but financially  I was stuck due to low trade in value."
"Should have known better than to buy a Fiat  I bought my 2012 Fiat 500 Pop used. This was 2 years ago and it had 36,000 miles on it. (Found out it had been a former rental car...in Las Vegas). The only reason I chose this one was it was the only used automatic they had (I can drive a manual but in L.A. I choose not to).  Electrical problems from the start. Warning lights always coming on (Check engine). Half the time they couldn't say what was wrong. For a couple months the car went to service every other week. Finally got that to stop then one day I turn on the car and the mileage was blinking. Again to the shop for resetting. I took my car in for an oil change a couple weeks ago and was told it had a leak (somewhere where they needed to drop out the engine). $89 for parts. Over $1k for labor. (Not had it done). This past Friday I pushed the button to lower my drivers window and heard a thunk. Window dropped an inch and has stayed there. Getting it fixed today. Thankfully (without being consulted when I bought the car) I somehow ended up with the extended warranty - Maximum Care. So the window will be just $100 (deductible). Going to find out if the oil leak is covered as well. I wanted to trade in the car for a new 500L since they contacted me looking for 2012 Pops. Too much negative equity. Well no kidding. This thing had negative equity when I bought it. Kicking myself for not buying the brand new Toyota Prius C that I test drove at another dealership. As soon as I can this car is gone!"
"Can't Wait To Get Rid Of It!  I've had this car for three years and have put 20,000 miles on it. Bought it because it was adorable, inexpensive, and great for my city-street/low-speed commute (which is now a freeway commute). Here is my take on the car:The GOOD: Cute as heck. Verde Chiaro color still turns heads. Good little car for putting around town (grocery-getter) on city streets. Brakes are responsive. Storage space in the car is about what you expect - not a lot of room but with a little bit of tetris skills you can fit a lot. Decent gas mileage (I expected better for a car so small).The BAD: I fear for my life on the freeway - no joke - and I am a very good driver who has never had an accident. Blind spots galore! Acceleration is extremely unreliable - sometimes you give it gas and it reluctantly goes slowly, other times the engine revs but it sits there... So if you need to make an evasive maneuver that requires accelerating, hit the gas and hope for the best. Engine noise gives me a headache. Interior shows scratches easily. My tire pressure monitor sensor stopped working at 15k (I haven't the time during the week to have it taken care of since the dealer won't do anything other than oil changes on Saturdays). My boyfriend said it's like a beer can on wheels and worries about my safety every day. Must use 91 octane or better gas for best performance. Doesn't always start on the first turn (Fiat said this is normal for this engine - ???).I foolishly accepted a lease term longer than I wanted and am almost done but am seriously considering eating the penalties for turning it in early. Especially since it looks like it is prone to having more mechanical issues that I would be responsible for."
"Still happy, just missing hubcaps.  I love my yellow FIAT.  It is the perfect city car for a single person.  I have probably taken 30 weekend trips of approximately 900-miles roundtrip and have never had a problem.  At 65,000 miles I needed to replace the tires and battery, but I am told that is as expected for a new car.  My only complaint to date has been the hubcaps... They keep falling off.  I got 5 replacements (at different times) from the dealership when I was under warrantee, but since that has ended I have been driving two hubcaps short for over 15,000 miles.  I hope to find some replacements soon, but since 2 of my 5 replaced FIAT hubcaps have fallen off a second time I plan to buy another brand to make it worth the money.  Other than the hubcaps I am very happy with my FIAT and it has been keeping up with my long weekends very well.  Besides the replacement for my tires and battery, plus regular oil and filter changes, I have not sunk any additional money into the car in almost 4 year."
"Don't waste your time and money on a Fiat  I love driving this car and it does turn heads, but it's in the shop a lot. I was willing to tolerate that since it's still under warranty, until the clutch ""wore out"". I've been driving a stick for 30+ years and have never worn out a clutch, so, in spite of what Fiat customer ""care"" said, it was not caused by my lousy driving. Although the rest of the car is still under warranty, the clutch is a wear item and is not covered. My car suddenly was undriveable (a potential safety issue), it was stranded 200 miles from my home, it cost $1200 out of my pocket to repair and over $300 in rental car fees to get home and then get back to pick up the car. This at less then 40K miles. "
"Too many repairs - clutch failure not warrantied  I want to love this car, but one of the main reasons I bought it was for its affordability and I haven't even had it 2 years and I'm already paying 10% of the original cost in repairs! I bought it one year used with 11,000 miles on it. It's now 28,000 at miles and it's had problems with everything from cosmetic issues like peeling paint, to an air bag sensor failure, to a very serious no-warning clutch failure (which was not covered under warranty after 15,000 miles). The clutch replacement at a FIAT dealer has taken 10 days so far and is costing a small fortune. It's a fun car but just not holding up! I always drove a Subaru or Toyota before and I think it may be time to go back. "
"Very Unhappy  I was driving at a speed of 55 mph when without any warning my car shut off.  Thank God I or someone else was not hurt. My fiat is a 2012 with 53000 miles on it.  The only thing Ive had to do is replace both brake lights at the same time and a headlight. When the car died, I could not get my key out of the ignition nor could I get the car out of gear.  It had totally locked up.  Just called the dealership and the car wont even communicated with the computer to find out whats wrong. Sounds expensive to me.  "
"Fun car - just hope nothing breaks  I have really enjoyed my 2012 FIAT Sport.  It is a fun car to drive, but there are issues.  at 61,000 miles I am having to put in a new transmission, as the pressure plate has failed.  I am not the only one, I am now at two weeks without my car, waiting on the parts.  Everything that has needed to be done on this car takes a long time for the parts to come in.  If you are considering a FIAT, turn around and RUN away from these cars."
"Reliable, Fun and Quick  My car has all the options and the mach stereo system. I have spent $0 repairing this Mustang other than neccesary ex. oil, fluids, and have had no problems. The v6 has plenty of power for the everyday user and unbelievable gas mileage on the highway. I put on a fuel induction preformance kit and now it sounds amazing, with great throttle response. I could not be happier!"
"Not good  2013 Sport purchased new now with 34K. Same problems many others are facing. Starting stumble, clunks heard and felt through steering system, suspension bumpers, eating tires once a year! Its nice to look at and fun to drive but that's about it. Run away if you appreciate what a ""good"" car is. Chrystler doesn't care if your car is broken, they'll tell you it's all ""normal"". You know, that ""normal"" clunk in the steering. The same clunk which would have stopped you/me from buying the car if a new one made it! Mine had that ""norma""l clunk after only 6K miles. Thanks for that screw Chrysler, I won't soon forget it! Your cars suck and Uncle Sam should've let fail like you deserved. Got worse! Clutch pressure plate springs failed at 59k. Fiat considers this a wearable item only covered by a 1 year, 12k mile warranty. All other clutch parts are un-worn. Disc looks new! Fiat demies any known issues with these pressure plates, yet many 5 speed owners are in this boat, weird!?! Garbage car from a garbage brand. Traded in at a HUGE loss after only 3 years. $14,000 in depreciation.I would NEVER buy another Fiat. If they were the last car company on earth,, I'd ride a bike."
"Baja Life  I bought my 2012 Fiat 500C (automatic) new in Aug 2012.  To date, I have put almost 60,000 miles on it.  I would drive 90 miles each way to work from Baja to San Diego on a daily basis.  The exterior has held up extremely well and I have had no mechanical issues!  The interior looks inexpensive but has held up well.  I'd buy one again in a heartbeat!"
"Disenchanted  I have a 2012 Lounge that I bought brand new and I am the only driver. I put 1000 km a week on my Fiat. Average 80km/hour. I have just over 141,000 km on the car and have been told by the dealer that the CV shaft (right and/or left) are toast and that maybe the transmission will also need replacing. I have a front end wobble at 65km/hour that goes away after 75km/hour. Anyone else have this problem? I'm looking at almost 6k to fix!!! This is ridiculous! I put over 480k on my toyota rav4, front wheel drive, 2 door coupe. This fiat should get at least 250k before I have problems like this."
"FANTASTIC VEHICLE!  First I have to say that my vehicle is an automatic; NOT a 5 speed manual. I'm not sure why there is no option for this model on the drop down.
My wife drove a rental one to AZ and feel in Love with it! 
I surprised her with a gift of this one and she has put about 30,000 miles on it in the last year. She averages 42 mpg combined!
On a recent trip I drove and we encountered some terrible weather outside of Wendover, NV. The POP drove right through the Heavy Wind and was NOT blown around when passing semis! This vehicle has TONS of room inside for being so small on the outside. Five people can fit comfortably for a trip!
Way to go FiatChrysler!"
"So far so good.  I bought My fiat 500 sport used with 30.000 miles on it. It now has 65,000 mile. After readying some negative reviews. All I can say that's truly unfortunate . So far my car has been running strong I drive my fiat daily commuting to work 60 miles every day. I take my car to my mechanic for its regular oil changes he also  lubes and looks over everything and every time I go to pick up my car he lets me know that everything looks good. Nothing to be concerned about. For those who take their car to the dealership and have had bad experience you're better off going to your own mechanic you trust. I have  the best mechanic . There are some things that disappoint me about my fiat, as you all kno"
"Never again!!!  Horrible. Needs engine replaced at 34,000 miles due to a cracked head. Check engine light flashing all the time, arm rest broke off, ball joint in front so bad it failed safety inspection. Both emblems front and back fading out."
"Sad to have raved about it  When I bought this car I was really excited and raved about it to all my friends. I expected nothing but great things from this little car and really started saving a lot of money in Gasoline purchases. (Was getting 42+ MPG by driving reasonably and not being aggressive with it, itÂs not a racer) 27,000 miles into it, the clutch failed (in rush hour traffic no less) and Fiat claims that it was just worn out. All calls for Customer Service ended in no help what-so-ever. Fiat is not ready to return to the American car market. Do not purchase this car.The clutch replacement at the studio costs 10 percent of the price of the car."
"Glad to be rid of it!!  I bought this car in august of 2012.RED, inside and out.I fell in love with the look.Bad idea.As soon as I took in on the highway the first time, the ABS sensor fell off.Then as soon as it spent one night in a snow bank), shocks were noisy.I can't remember how many garage visits, but they were never able to fix it.Then, the transmission failed, I was unable to press the clutch pedal.then again this winter, the same issue with the shocks after another night in the snowbank.Avoid this car at all costs.Dealer as well as Fiat Canada were extremely unhelpful too.Thank god another dealer was a lot more helpful.Got rid of the thing last week and bought a Toyota."
"WARNING - Dangerous vehicle  while driving in left hand hand lane of I-95 in FL, (blood alley) the engine shut down and I had to drift over 2 lanes to the hard shoulder.got towed to dealership where the valve actuator, camshaft and generator had to be replaced.this vehicle had only 6000 miles on it.after NO help from dealership or FIAT corporate office I have no faith in this brand at all.I'm lucky to be alive.please note this is an automatic vehicle. there was no option for automatic in the dropdown menu."
"I wish I didn't purchase this car.  Sigh..I fell in LOVE with my little 2012 Fiat 500 Sport until problem after problem. I just hit 30k miles and so far here are the issues; Clutch plate needed fixed, sometimes it wouldn't start since day 1; boot shifter replaced 2x; back windshield wiper fluid doesn't spray anymore, tire has a hole in it upon purchase, noticed next day, clock replaced as it wouldn't keep time, radio (CD Player) wouldn't eject CD's. I bought the car with 4 miles on it. I do not trust the Fiat dealerships and I do not trust this car anymore. I am trading it in soon. It's ashame, as I loved it."
"Addicted to my Mustang!  I have never been dissapointed. I passed 90,000 miles a few months ago and it runs great! I did have to replace the brake pads but it wasnt a big deal. 4 people in my family drive Mustangs ranging from 1988 to 2000 and we all feel the same way!"
"Not Happy  I bought the Fiat 500 less than 6 months ago and have never been so unhappy with a vehicle.The gas mileage is not what is advertised, the interior design is horrible, no center console, the visors do not even come close to protecting your face, the heat/ac when set on your feet blows directly, about 1/2"" from your driving ankle so it either burns your ankle or freezes it.And do not let the wind blow at all because you cannot hold the car on the roadway.I do not enjoy driving anymore and can't wait to trade the car in."
"One of the best I've ever owned  Bought mine with optional alloy wheels, sunroof, and a couple of other options in April 2012. Got a great price. Had the car now for 17 months & have driven 38,000 miles with no mechanical problems.There was a service bulletin recall concerning ungrounded starter bolts which the dealership fixed promptly along with a blown bi-halogen headlight(probably related to the ungrounded starter bolts). However, service tech did not unhook the battery while replacing starter bolts and shorted out the climate control panel. So, now, the car is back @ the dealer to replace this. Dealer did give a loaner.Absolutely no other issues. Car is great on gas(38-40mpg mostly highway) and fun, fun to drive. "
"Fiat 500 sport  I bought it new with 60000 klm warranty.Most of my problems started after that and when I got to 85000 I traded it in for a honda fit.When I traded it the following repairs were required. Air conditioning not working, front end repairs for $1600.Leaking heater core, high beams that won't go to low. Brake power unit for $900.Paid 18000 and got 8000 on trade after 16 months and 85000 klm.MY dealer experience was awful.The salesmen were busy fighting over me, that on delivery I got the wrong car ( ordered white with bose stereo and got Grey with standard stereo.)Service dept. was not much better, as my request to return old parts for me to inspect were ignored. (commisons)"
"! un happy Camper  I bought this turbo sport4 days ago and it's been in the shop twice already for repair, brand new car with 100 miles already has problems. I wished I had never seen the thing . I don't reccomend this car to anyone, ever. I will probably end up using the lemon law on this one , what a shame."
"Love-hate relationship  I bought my 500 sport with 3,000 miles on it - dealer sales staff drove the car. While it looked cool and was extremely fun to drive, I quickly learned to loathe the car. Two steering arms and one master control module later (car had less than 20,000 miles on it), I looked for any way to unload this car without taking a huge loss. In addition to these issues, the backseat began to come apart at 12,000 miles (and rarely did I have anyone sit in the back). The engine block heater worked wonderfully but it began to malfunction and send error codes to the main computer. I was calling the dealer (90 miles away) for service every few weeks. Finally, at 24,500 miles, I called it quits."
"500 lounge, with every option  car is fun to drive, gets really good mileage,steering tie rod end was loose after 30,000km, replaced under warranty.buy this car only for the fun and new factor, definitely a chick's car, but i see too many old italian guys driving it......"
"Fiat 500-The City Dweller  Our household has two 2012 Fiat 500 Pops, 20 serial numbers apart. Both vehicles have around 2000 miles on them. On one vehicle the oxygen sensor has failed. On the other vehicle the glove box is out of alignment. We bought these Fiats because they are cute, easy to get in and out of, easy to park, and had low initial purchase prices. Considering the standard features there wasn't another car in that size range that offered as much. "
"Great Piccolo!!!  It has been a little more than a year that I get my 500 Sport, after 15,000 miles my wife and I are so happy with it, is like a go-kart, is too much fun, easy to park ""zero"" problems and great service from our dealer.I'm looking for the Abarth in the next future. Esta de rompe""m"".Existen vehiculos mas rapidos pero no tan divertidos para manejar."
"Fiat driver for life  I bought my 2012 Fiat 500 sport in May of last year. It came right off of the showroom floor. They placed my requested aftermarket rims on the car and it came with the Italian stripes down the side. Leather seats and a white and black dash. The design and colors are stunning together. The manual makes the car very quick and fun to drive. I would never buy an automatic Fiat. I drive my car through downtown Atlanta then on the interstate during my 30 mile one waycommute. Never had a problem and the ride is very comfy. If you take care of your car and love it, it will do the same for you. This car is absolutely perfect."
NO BUENO!!  Car had to have engine replaced at 10K miles and had transmission problems at 16K miles. 
"Completely Satisfied  I love my Mustang! It has 85,000 miles on it and no problems. Definitely the funnest car I've ever had. I would buy another one in a heartbeat."
"CUTE! I LOVE IT!  So I was pretty stoked when I bought this car, its way cute and fun to drive! The only issue I have with it are the very cheap interior fixtures. A common breaking item is the armrest, yeah, dealer said its a common issue and is covered under warranty, havent taken it in just yet so well see for sure later. Also, the under seat drawer handel broke on me :-/ I was very dissappointed to find that the Pop Models do not come equipped with Blue&Me, even though edmunds states that its a standard feature. Also if you squeen the upper lining of the cabin, it feels literally like its made of egg cartons and cheap felt :-( needless to say, super CUTE car at a great price, sucky cheap interior."
"Another Happy Camper  I also bought my Fiatt on a whim which is very unusual for me.I had done a lot of internet research and was ready for a change.One drive of the Fiatt 500 and I was sold.I loved the variety of colors, the nimble handling, the pick up and the dealership was decent.One thing that was very important was to buy fun with comfort and this car delivers.It's small, but you are not sitting on the ground.I am 5 ft. 6 and it's just an even turn and sit to be in the drivers' seat.My driving is about 70/30 highway/city and I am getting about 35 to the gallon.Then final deciding factor will be how it handles the roads in the winter, otherwise I am 100% happy."
"Looks and fuel economy...without the gimmicks  I never pictured myself as a Fiat guy. We got it as a rental when we were on vacation, and after that my mind was made up. It's sporty looking on the outside and the inside (Sport model), it has a great sound system, and it has been extremely reliable. Of course it also gets excellent fuel economy without gimmicky buttons or hybrid technology, which I'm not sold on. I average around 40 mpg hwy on my daily commute to work, which is well above the 34 EPA on my automatic. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a car that's fun to drive, turns heads, rides smooth and gets great fuel economy, look no further."
"You're paying for FUN!  Loads of fun. For a tiny car it's comfort and ammenities are unsurpassed. It takes 15 minutes to get fueled because people run over to look and ask questions and 'pet' it lol.I don't know how long it will last, how reliable it will be, but it's a blast to own it. I can't even pick one favorite feature there are so many: auto sunroof,Boze sound, TomTom, Sirius Sat, colorful instrumentation, retro style. Wow. No car in this price range has all of that."
"The Design Standard City Car  I only have a few hundred miles on my Fiat 500 Pop hatchback, but my initial impression and every bit of available research and feedback tell me that Fiat has hit the mark with this Americanized version of their hit European city car.Even at 6' 5"" and 240 pounds, I fit easily in the cabin and like everything about the driving and pedal positions, clutch, shifter, steering and all the features, from steering wheel controls to ""sport"" mode selection.My Fiat handles well, both at highway speed and close quarters city driving.It reminds me of my 1970 VW Beetle, but with modern handling technology and almost twice the horsepower.Like the Beetle, it's an incredible bargain as well."
"Fabulous Dynamic Car!  After research andtest driving many different vehicles, I bough a Fiat 500 Sport with all of the options, including power sunroof.I was close to getting the Prius C or Mini Cooper, however, the Fiat just was superior to them in many ways.I absolutely love the style and feel of this small car.It is peppy and responsive in my city/suburban driving.Although the interior is small, I like it that way so I'm not driving a lot of car bulk on the road.The Fiat sits high up with other cars, making you level with other drivers, so it is safer.I wanted a small, quality, fuel-efficient car that stood apart from the rest of the pack on the road.The Fiat 500...classy, unique, perfect."
"Fun little commuter car  I bought my 2012 Sport as a replacement for a string of Volkswagens, most recently a GTI, mostly because I wanted something a little different and I was impressed with the design.The 500 has not disappointed so far.I get more compliments/questions about it than any car other than my Ferrari. I have had no problems with it so far, although I have only had it for about a month.It is fun to drive, recognizing that it underpowered and one really has to rev it to make it go.I am getting great mileage -- a real 33 mpg driving to work in city traffic if I drive like an old lady; 31 or so otherwise."
"Feeling Regret  Back in June of 2011 when I bought my 500, I can't even tell you how excited I was.I had been waiting for these to hit the States for several years.Loved (and still do love) the retro look.Efficient and fun to drive?Most definitely.Quality is where the 500 falls short.I understand cheap materials.Those are to be expected.The unexpected?I just scheduled my 8th service visit.It pains me to say that I have started looking at the best way to get rid of this car with the least amount of loss.With 13,000 miles on it, it acts like a car with 100,000, and that simply doesn't work.Amazing concept, questionable execution.Wish it weren't so!My dealer's attitude is no help."
"8000 First oil filter change  Red POP,red white interior and stick. 6 months in use. Very happy. Reliable, no issues, none! Confy ride. Gas,gas,gas hapiness. Only drawback, chicks keep stopping and asking me about it, hehehe."
"Excellent bang for buck  I was skeptical at first, but so far..everything is great.I just traded in my 08 Mini for the Fiat 500 Sport.I live in Houston, and do a lot of running around the city.It's peppy, quick, and easy to drive and park.If you enjoy a smaller ride, you should seriously consider purchasing a Fiat.I test drove the manual and automatic through city streets and on the freeways.I felt that the manual had much more power and pep.You have to know when to downshift to maximize your driving potential.For the price, you definitely wont find anything remotely close.I miss the speed of my Mini, but not the overpriced maintenance and heavy ride."
"fun and sporty  Originally went to buy a Cougar - couldn't make the deal.  Went over to Ford and drove a used Mustang.  Most of the miles have been highway and the Stang is nothing but fun to take on a trip.  Mileage has been outstanding - upper 20's and occasionally getting into the 30's.  Changing the stock 15"" wheels out for the 17"" Mach 1 wheels made it even sportier and better handling. Even though the car is now 6 years old I still get compliments on it's sporty looks. Car has been flawless and reliable. Admittedly it is a little tough to drive in snow so it has been the summer time trip car.   "
"Love my Fiat 500 C Pop  I have owned several Fiats through the years and i can honestly say, they are misunderstood. I have had a 1974 124 Sport, which was fun as could be to drive. I owned a 1980 Fiat 2000 Spider convertible ( also known as a 124). That was  a blast to drive. I went through a midlife crisis and got another 1981 Fiat Spider convertible, this will always put a smile on your face, something about the top down and the wind in your hair and face. Forward to the 2012 Fiat 500C Pop, what a great design to put a cloth retractable top inside the roof pillars, much safer and way cooler. The car rides and feels like a big car, it is very solid and sure footed. I am 6 foot 1 and have plenty of room and I find the front seating extremely roomy and comfortable. I always sit in the back whenever i purchase a vehicle to see how much headroom and legroom my less fortunate passengers will have. While i am an empty nester, i tend to flop the rear seats down and create a nice little cargo hauling area that is very practical for hauling my two dogs around or for groceries. I bought my car used with 20,000 miles on it in 2014, i have since put 60,000 miles with regular oil changes and tire rotations. i have changed my own spark plugs twice, which is fairly simple, as is changing the air filter and cabin filter.  I purchased an aftermarket warranty, but I have never needed to use it. There was a recall on a manual clutch spring replacement, where they also have to replace the brake sensor, but that was covered under the recall. I am sad that the cars do not hold their resale value, but I believe that the 500 C model was done correctly. I know there have been alot of complaints with the 500 L 4 door, but that is a different engine and model altogether. I love my 500C Pop convertible manual transmission. If you dont know about manual transmissions, they are the best kept secret. They are a lot more fun to drive. You are more involved with the driving experience and that is what you are doing driving! therefore one tends to pay more attention. I spoke with a used car salesman recently and he stated that he specifically bought a manual transmission vehicle for his daughter.... Because she would not be able to text and drive!  She was initially upset.. but she thanked him later for this. Something to think about. I have had my Fiat up to 101 MPH and it rides the same at all speeds, 50-70 is the perfect speed for this vehicle, I cant stress enough ,  the big car feel. This is something American cars are getting better at, but I honestly do not know if I will ever buy American. I have owned several German cars and brands and there is nothing quite like their feel for the road, however reliablity and parts and pricing is a different story.  I have owned Japanese and Korean and found them to be the most reliable. To make a long story short, on a beautiful day with the top down and a nice day trip planned with you and that special someone, I highly reccomend that you take the route less traveled in the vehicle (Fiat 500C Pop, Manual) less driven. You will not be disappointed. Just do your homework and check the car fax maintenance records.  Good solid car, great gas mileage, unlimited smiles and Italian sexy."
"Endearing, comfortable, reliable but quirky  This purchase was for fun, a cheeky weekend companion with a full-length cloth sunroof. Yet the 500c is incredibly convenient for any drive that requires a parking spot hunt or urban commute. Heated leather seats are upright and comfortable, its good sound system and Sport driving mode make it more engaging. Top down, it makes me smile and the multiple positions for the top allow as much nature into the care as I choose. Loud exterior sounds are muted when the insulated top is closed, and it's remained secure and waterproof. The trunk opening is narrow, but reasonably sized for groceries and gym bags. The engine sounds a bit agricultural, but it scoots along. Fog lights are helpful, and the A/C is powerful. Gas mileage reflects my eagerness to toss the car around, and the visibility with the top down is poor. Switchgear puts style over ergonomics, but I love the use of color and materials. The plastic on the doors feels cheap and shows scuff marks; Fiat's 1957 Edition uses a different design. My only issues in six years: resets of the top mechanism (the fix is thoroughly described in the manual), a squeaky seat frame, a low front end that scrapes on some speed bumps, and a battery failure. Overall, fewer trips to the dealer than my Honda and Toyota!"
CPop popped!!!!!  It was a fun car that was a joy to drive. It doesn't pretend to be a Corvette. It's a Fiat and proud of it. Sold it in a minute to a guy who drove one years ago while courting his wife of many years.
It Popped!  Fun car to own and drive. It a crowd pleaser with loads of people smiling when I drive by. Enjoyed it very much. I almost forgot to put in gas.
"Sporty little car with a big personality!  I was in the market to buy a car for my son, a high school senior who will be college-bound next year and in need of good, reliable, safe wheels under him. The Fiat 500c seemed the perfect fit, literally - my son is  6' 5"" and he slipped right in to the driver's seat with ease. There was plenty of head and leg room, once the tilt wheel and seat were adjusted. This car handles extremely well and is very tight on turns. What surprised me was the amount of interior space - the outside appearance is deceiving, as once you get inside, it is a well distributed area for 4 people.  Equally so is the trunk space, which provides a deep, larger-than-expected compartment for all kinds of storage.  Even better is the feature of the split rear seat, which folds down and allows for larger items to fit from the folded down seat to the trunk space.  Very smooth ride - takes those bumps in the road really well which reflects a good suspension system. Plus, it's a convertible !!  What's better than that?  Although I have firmly told my son that he is not to put the top down and stand up while driving, with his feet on the wheel....!   Also comes with some nice options like a 7-speaker Bose sound system, fog lights, hands-free Blue-tooth phone system, heated seats and special chrome trim that comes with the ""Lounge"" (high end) model.  It is a great little car that is super on gas and a blast to drive - my son loves it.  Life is too short, and for a car in this price range, loosen up and go grab some fun.  You won't be sorry!"
Fiat 500C  
"Great car with a lot of small issues  Would be a great car if the interior quality was a little better, if you get the convertible then be aware that the light color headliner suffers from discoloration in the rear and that Fiat and the dealers will not correct the issue, instead blaming it on dust that gets on the interior. You will be going to the shop for small things and they will add up over time."
"The City car  This car was designed to be in a city. The city mpg was always over 22 and the highway went as high as 40. Highway driving was fine with the acceleration of the manual gearbox allowing me to merge into traffic going 60+ mph. I was comfortable driving at 72 mph.Most of my driving was in the Boston area and traversing the river on a high bridge gave me no difficulty in a cross wind.  The back seat was occasional used (sometime by me) by adults with no difficulty as long as the passenger seat was move forward a little. With the back seat  folded down and access through the hatchback made this a useful vehicle. I always got a lot of attention in a parking lot. The looks were attractive to lots of people and the would ask me about the issues I described above. Overall, a good, reliable, stylish car."
"THE WORSE VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED!  I have owned this vehicle since April of 2012, and since the first week I bought it, I've had nothing but problems with it.  From the rear brake lights going out, to damage tires, bad tire/wheel bearings after short time of ownership, convertible top replaced twice, electrical issues, trunk issues (not opening - 4 times since 2012), soft top roof leak, etc."
"Worst Car on the Road.  IMHO, this is the worst and most dangerous car on  US highways.   We were given one as an Enterprise rental, so beware.    On the Interstates, it feels like the Fiat 500 could be run over by any compact American car.  The ride was rough and noisy.    I've been told that some people love them......but I think it's a standard answer for those who already have them.   I was teased by acquaintances who suggested I put the Fiat in the back of their car.    My wife, me and two suitcases were hard to squeeze into it!   Terrible car....and without a doubt the worst car I've ever rented.  Complaints to Enterprise went nowhere....only questions.   My objective would be to keep the Fiat off American roads."
"lots better than a Focus  When I went to the dealer to pick up the car, I passed a Focus in the lot selling for the same price as what I paid for the Mustang. Figured I got a much better car. After 106,000 miles, I couldn't be happier. Only thing I had to replace beside wear items was a idle pulley for $11. Brake pads lasted 60K miles and did not put brake dust on the wheels. I get 21 mpg with the alcohol/gas mixture they sell in Houston. Performance tires made the car handle much better in the rain. Engine accessibility with the v6 is excellent. Parts are cheap at parts store (not dealer)."
Dangerous  This car has left me standed in the middle of intersections and is super dangerous.  Fiat finally agreed to pay me but for the past 4 months has not returned my calls.  I also noticed that all negative posts have vanished.
"Why me!!!  700 characters...not enough.  Since day one, this car has been the most unreliable piece of poop I have ever owned.  Fiat Canada has washed their hands of me, but i have decided to make all know, DO NOT BUY A FIAT!!!  
New transmission, new suspension, new clutch bearings, new PCM computer, rattling all over, paint peeling, lights burning out all over the place, 35 trips to the dealer and problems that they can not even fix after 8 tries!!!  My car sounds like it want to start, but does not catch, have to do everything from the beginning and will start on the second shot!  Thank goodness I bought a 5 year bumper to bumper warranty!!!  I feel bad for those that only had a 3 year warranty :(."
"Great value but some issues  I love the retro look and feel, the interior is gorgeous but there are a few issues with my 3 yr old 50,000KM 500C. 
 I bought it 3 years old and a few days ago I've started to hear some creaking noises on the passenger side and back, sounds almost like the plastic on the doors is not put together tightly... I can't figure out what it is exactly but it's SUPER annoying."
"55,000 miles with some wear & smiles  We just crossed the 55K mile barrier and again with no issues. The car still generates positive attention, smiles, and questions. It's been the most cost effective vehicle we've ever owned. Granted, we own the Pop version with the least amount of electronic equipment. I added Nokian Hakkapalitta R2 snow tires this winter season. The 500C drove through the snow and slush like a champ. Showing some wear on the convertible top plastic strip - the clear film is pealing away."
"So Far so good  We bought a 2012 pop c in February 2013 for my wife. She thought it was a great looking car and we were trading a Mini Cooper. We only have 3000 miles on it so it's hard to say it has been a great car. We have had to have the headliner replaced already - really, the headliner... Anyway, my wife still likes the car. It gets good gas mileage although she doesn't drive it often. Interior parts are cheap plastic but we haven't had anything break yet. Service department is OK to deal with, BUT my one major complaint so far is that FIAT doesn't offer courtesy cars to drive if they have to keep your car which is different from any other manufacturer I have ever dealt with."
"Love It  We bought our Fiat 500c last Jan. We have had no problems with our fiat at all. We have gone to Az, Tenn 3x's, and back to Pa three times. Love it great gas mileage.Only one thing has popped up in the back seat there is a radling going on not sure what it is.But its not a big thing. We want to trade it in for the 500L now. Not that we don't like our 500c but we want more room for traveling. "
"loved my FIAt...for first 5 months...hated Chrysler/Bob Baker Carlsbad :(  bought brand new car, only 3K miles, sometimes it would start, sometimes it wouldn't...not a good feature in a car! at first dealer suggested I was doing something wrong, but after having it towed 3 X, they finally realized I wasn't making this up. It was there for 2 months, I asked them finally for replacement (lemon law, which my car, which was sadly the case) so they dragged their feet for another month, plus charged me for mileage on the poor car they sold me. It was extortion, but after 3 months I paid it just to get a car....I don't think the service dept was at fault, they simply couldn't figure out what's wrong, but the dealer didn't help us at all, and Chrysler was even worse."
"Silly, Crazy FUN!! I am sooo in love!  Are you kidding me? I love this car so much. I keep my cars for years...I had an 82 Rabbit Convertible for 17yrs and a 99 Beetle for 14yrs. I obviously love fun cars. The minute i test drove this car I was hooked. I only drive manual transmissions, so I am only speaking about manual Fiat 500c. I feel like I am in a Fellini movie, everytime I get behind the wheel. People keep talking to me at every stop light. If you don't like lots of attention...don't purchase one. It is a cute little race car. There is a button for SPORT mode...this gives you an option for RPMS. I am a flight attendant, so I don't drive too much. When i do drive I want something that makes me smile. This is a GEM!"
"Fun to look and drive, but too many problems  Too many issues for a new car, even if they fix all the problems for free.I like the car, it performs as expected. It is a city car, easy to park, drives very well from 0-40, and able to handle the highway. The convertible top makes for a fun summer drive. I get great mileage, 31 in rush hour bumper to bumper traffic, if I take it easy I have no problems surpassing the est highway and getting 41. So far I have had two ignition coils go bad, one resulting in being stranded. The radio failed to work when very cold, and now 1/2 the climate controls have gone dark. They have fixed all the problems free of charge, but the longer I own it the more I fear ""What next will go wrong?"
"5-STARS for the 500  2.5 months 2300 miles 40.7mpg on 87OctaneHad to adjust the headlights downward, but that was the only issue.Rado/CD/USB media/Bluetooth all work great! ECO Drive download to PC to monitor efficiency is nice if you want to save the universe.Key fob remote range is very short :( 5M trans very easy to use even in stop light traffic. Cold AC!My F-150 (17.5mpg) sits while I cruise all over town.I used to consume 2 gallons a day, so now I'll save enough to break even at initial cost, current driving distance, and gas prices-- all in about 16 years, but it will be so much fun!!!"
Just owned a week.  Such a fun car to drive.  Not the fastest one out there but love the exhaust throaty sound when you romp on the gas.  
"Quick, Nimble and Fun Ride  We purchased the 500C in November and have driven 6,000 with no problems.The rides comfortably, is very nimble and accelerates nicely to stay with the traffic.It is not a race car but very sporty.This car cruises the highway at 75 mph and accelerates well throughout the entire range of the speedometer.Driver visibility is excellent as the car sits higher than others of it's size.Front seats accomodate all but the largest passengers.Rear seats are cramped for adults but just right for kids.This is a very fun car to drive and park.It's also easy to get in and out due to its height. Overall the car seems well made and we have had no maintenance issues."
"Amazing  6 weeks in and 3000K miles.If your looking for a fuel efficient, fun to drive, great looking car at a bargin price, this car is it.I bought the 5 speed manual.I average 40 mpg(combined) and I use regular gas.Don't waste your money on premium.No issues.Car feels like a much more expensive car, all around.The car has plenty of pickup and flys on the highway.The convertible is very quiet.The fiat is quieter than a 2005 Honda s2000 that I bought new.Looking at the car you would never think it will fit 4 people, but it does.Brakes are great as is the handling.If you buy it, you won't be disappointed.I can't get enough of driving this car."
"CUSTOMER SERVICE IS PATHETIC  I also have had ""issues"" with my Fiat.Some are being rectified others...my loss.Will need to wait for 6-8 weeks for a part r/t the strut.Concerned with an event.. ""slipping into drive"" while idling.Not explanable nor able to recreate.Now I am concerned with safetyPoor customer service including refusal to give reasoning in writing, an e-mail address and also to give me the persons last name that denied minor repair.Response: ""I contacted Fiat Canada via phone and therefore my response was to be via phone"".Requested an appeal and denied...told she was the final say and was speaking for FIAT.All I can say is buyer beware!!! Well with FIAT CANADA anyway!"
"500 Pop Manual - Fast Car and Love it  My first car was an MGB and I loved it. I feel the exact same way about this car.I smile to and from work every day.Also, it WILL go fast but you have to drive it like an Italian.Here's what it takes. 1. Manual Transmission - Auto is not quick2. Sport button on3. Shift at high RPMs - 4000 to 65004. High Octane Premium Gas - BP 93 works5. Mobile 1 oil-makes Multivalve engine run better6. High Flow Drop In air filter - check 500madnessOther than the transmission, this set of small changes made a huge difference in how the car responds.It flys.Also, with Sport on, the steering is crisp and the throttle is quick.Take a test drive. You will love it too."
"I've fallen!  I have fallen in love with the Fiat 500! I went from a VW New Beetle to my Fiat and I couldn't be happier! I was going to get a Mini but could never pull the trigger. The moment I sat down in the Fiat it had me. The drive is wonderful, the features are amazing and all at an extremely great price! I only wish the seats sat a little lower but that could be due to being used to driving a Bug for the past 5 years.Do yourself a favor and if you are at all contemplating a Fiat, get one!!! "
"Exceeds expectations and is fun.  Fuel mileage is much better than the 38mpg highway posted on the sticker.An average of 41mpg was observed during a nice 40 mile long curvy and hilly back road drive mostly at 45mph in 4th gear with the top open.The car is a joy to travel in.It has plenty of room and comfort for 4.At 65mph with the top full open and windows closed, it is quiet enough to have normal conversations between all 4 occupants.Very quiet ride with top open or closed.Top can be operated with push button control while driving under 50mph.Car is fun enough to make our mid teen age kids still want to go with us.Back seats are roomy and comfortable for picky an long legged kids 5'8"" tall."
This thing shifts terribly!  Brand new fully loaded lounge cabrio.. This thing is the worst around town. I have an automatic - because that's your only option. When it shifts from 1st to 2nd you get a whiplash-like jerk. The gas pedal is awful too. Its always too little gas or too much. Something is wrong with the design of this car. Seriously. Oh yeah.. you cannot pull out across traffic.. there is a two second delay between slamming the gas down and the car actually moving. Its not a lemon.. it just stinks!!!
"great car  its very small , so if you are not crazy about small cars and if you are 6ft 3 in and 240 lbs with a lard bucket rear end you should look elsewhere . its the most fun on 4 wheels that I have ever had !"
"Whirrrrrrr whistle growl pop burble  Overall this thing is good for basic transportation for someone who likes to drive.  Set your expectations low, the interior is not primo, but if that's what you want then save up for something more upscale.  The interior has some character but is definitely basic.  The seats are sporty and the fabric feels robust.  Racing Stripes, Racing stripes!  How did they get inside my car again?  The seats have a single red stripe going longways, I'll keep em.  I use this car to commute through city streets and park it on the curb.  Those big rims will get scratched, hail will damage the steel roof and eventually someone will drive their car into my car followed by driving their car away.  Such is life.  This is a more fragile car than anything I've had, the intercoolers are in the edges of the front bumper, meaning a fender bender will cost f$ht dollars.  The brake calipers are within fingers reach of any passerby.  Putting new tires on will scratch the rims very badly if you don't go out of your way to find a specialty shop.  All that aside, this car rocks.  It makes a unique exhaust sound, seems like it has never made the same sound twice.  whirrrrr, whistle, growl, pop burble.  Rippin through the corners and being a tiny car, 5 speed rowing and being such an unconventional car.  Plenty of room for the average person and whatever junk the tote around with them, maybe even room for a friend."
Customer service # 1 Priority??????/  I purchased this car from a dealer within 5 miles of my home.  Within one year of purchasing this car the dealer went out of business.  I then started to take the car to a dealer near to where I work but they are no longer providing any service that is under warranty for Fiat as they have a dispute with Fiat.  My check engine light is on and I am now told that I can have the car towed to a dealer that is a 90 minute drive from my home but it is my responsibility to pick it up.  Calls to and emails to Fiat go unanswered.  It is a great car and I loved it but don't buy a Fiat.  You cannot count on their relationships with their dealers.
"So so....  I was exceptionally impressed with the down and dirty V6.  The Chevy Monte Carlo LT and SS Intimidator have nothing on the 4.0 stock!! I bought an 06 5-speed Pony Edition before I went to college.  It's about 8 months later and the throttle body is havin issues, killing the car about every 30 miles.  The clutch is slipping already, not impressed with that.  The Shaker 500 is really nice, don't crank it too loud though.  The amp for the stereo runs down the factory battery like no other.  It's reliable as heck until the engine starts acting up.  Had the system checked, so I know its the throttle body.  For a car that is four years old, the clutch and induction should not be having trouble."
"Still excited about driving this car  After 6 years, its still a thrill to drive this car.  This car is my daily driver, and it has never let me down.  Only maintenance problem that I have ever had was a fuel filter replacement ($200).  If you want to keep the stock tires on it (Goodyear Eagles z-rated), be prepared to shell out some cash.  Average z-rated tires last about 20-25K before needing replacement.  The car seems to get lighter in the front at higher speeds, but then settles down around 70-80.  Very throaty exhaust with tight suspension for turning.  Finally, I've never lacked power to get out of the path of bad drivers.  The 265 horses it comes with, makes it feel like the muscle car it was designed to be."
"There are no boring trips in an Abarth!  This is a niche car and not for everyone, and that's why it's a special. A Camry or an Accord are for everyone, and when you make something to please as many people as possible you end up with middle of the road blandness. That's great for some, not for Abarth owners. This is a performance car based on a relatively humble small European city car, originally designed for dense urban areas. So, yeah, if you have 5 kids and two dogs, guess what? It's not a car for you. If you like space, fuel and technological efficiency, are concerned of your footprint on the planet but really like to drive, then an Abarth may be for you. It oozes character, it sounds fantastic and I love that it doesn't look like it's angry and wants to kill you, like so many other cars on the market. It's actually pretty comfortable for long trips, and despite its compact exterior dimensions, it has a lot of space, more than a Mini. I'm 5'-10"" and 190lbs and I can sit comfortably in the rear seat behind myself. It's easy to park and cheap to fill the tank, and no one get s annoyed at you when you pass them. Try doing that in a BMW or Mercedes.I considered a Ford Fiesta ST, but was turned off by the four door-only bodystyle, and although objectively it was a tad more refined than the Abarth in some areas, it just didn't feel special, and certainly wasn't as much fun to drive. The quality of materials is not on par with say, a Lexus, but then it doesn't cost Lexus money. I've had mine for two years and the only issues I've had were a burned out light bulb in the cruise control switch and a faulty tire pressure monitoring sensor. Nothing squeaks or rattles. Overall, I've been very very happy with this car."
"Turn the ignition, nothing happens!  My 2012 Fiat L was purchased new from dealer in late 2012.  Very glad it came with a 50,000 4 yr warranty as it spends a lot of time at the dealer getting ""fixed.""  After 3 attempts to correct issue with tire pressure light staying on, gave up on it and just disregard the light.  My car shut off while I was on the highway doing 55 so I felt blessed to have been able to get it to the shoulder.  I was an hour from home in Feb on a freezing day with an infant in the car, but when I my husband arrived the car started and he drove it home like nothing had happened.  Sixteen months later, the car died dead again while driving near the beach, this time I had AAA and had it towed to the dealer.  Gone nearly 2 weeks and they just replaced the alternator & battery.  After that the car would no longer start on first turn of ignition but roared to life on second try... but six weeks later would not start at all.  Almost 2 weeks at dealer as they replaced the starter.  Two months later, it still won't start on first turn of ignition and it has randomly refused to start at all 3 times in the past month.  If I move the shift, open/close door, step on brake and go thru antics it starts, usually after I have called AAA to come get me and have to call them back to cancel the tow.  I have had it.  Hope to have enough equity to trade by this coming Fall as the negatives are outdoing the positives at this point.  I do love the look, the size and the gas mileage but once my warranty is over, this is NOT a car I want to keep due to scary maintenance costs."
"Still a Wonderful little car.  Look if you want a big roomy car buy somethin else! If you want a fun, decent handling & very quick car get the Abarth. Took mine from Idaho to California & back. Lots of freeway travel. It was great. If your between 5' 9"" & 6' and of normal weight then its quite comfortable. Had minor issue with fuel vacuum line. Check engine light comes on. Took to dealership enroute.  Was diagnosed, reset. Was warned might come on again. It did. Took to home dealership. Was taken care of. You cannot compare this car to other outside its segment. So, for all the people that complain about how small it is and that its not safe on the freeway, then why did you buy one. Means that you didn't check it out to see if it met your needs. DUH. As for me I love this little Abarth. By the way I suggest buying into MOpar's extended warrenty IS A GOOD INVESTMENT. If your concern is everything falls apart after factory warrenty expires. Most car's do have issues here or there. Why do u think the manufactured brands only go so far with their warranties. side skirts detachment  had become an issue. Fiat took care of problem. Still think it is more fun & better than Cooper S Clubman I had. Seats way more comfortable.  Handles better. Sounds great. Everything remains the same as it maintains the fun factor. Performance  has actually increased ! No additional issues with side skirts. Looking at the 500X to replace my old ML55 AMG"
"Getting Costly to Own.  3 Vent knobs came off under warranty. Driver arm rest came apart under warranty but the first repair disabled the seats ability to move forward by pulling on seat back release handle and it took them several months and 4 returns for repair until they figured it out. The original battery suddenly went dead with no warning just past warranty leaving us stranded and in need of a road side service call and new battery. Most costly was main computer malfunction at 62,000 miles out of warranty at a cost of over $700.00 and still making payments on original car loan and this major problem, the problems was the headlights would not turn off, not even with switched to off nor by shutting off car, had to unplug headlights. The new computer is warrantied for just one year. At the same time as the computer going out the service department stated the steering was in need of repair at a cost of nearly $300, at this time I have yet to repair the steering and am driving it as is since the service person said it wouldn't keep me from safe driving."
"GORGEOUS  Traded my Prima for the Abarth. So glad I did. It drives and handles so much better with more than enough power and much more connected. The soundtrack from the exhaust is phenomenal, has to be the best stock soundtrack out there. Fuel mileage is consistently 33-34mpg. I use premium seeing as it's turbo charged. My Prima averaged 36-38 mpg. Love driving this car. It's a blast. Looking forward to the Abarth convertible!"
"The Manny Pacquiao of the car world  Easily the best decision I've ever made on an impulse. While looking at the Sport model, this Abarth was left behind by the original buyer. I snapped it up as I overheard him declining to buy it after ordering it. Let's see, this car goes like stink, gets phenomenal gas mileage (I'm averaging 38 on the highway at 75 mph), looks like nothing else, is built well, is very uncommon, is surprisingly comfortable on any sort of trip, has standard options that most cars would not in this price range, has an exhaust that makes a Ferrari jealous, and it's priced perfectly. Abarth is like the Carroll Shelby of the 500 world. They took something that was nearly perfect and made it perfect. "
"It's a conspiracy  Fiat is very popular in Europe and that success enabled them to buy Chrysler motors. These days cars are mostly built well and if maintained properly will provide good service, why not drive a car that looks good doing it? I think people tend to abuse a small sporty car like the 500 and then give a bad review, NEWS FLASH! Even though it sounds like one, driving it like a Ferrari In Affordable Trim is a mistake. Driving this car feels like you're going faster than you actually are so you needn't abuse it to get the fun Italian sports car feel. That in itself is my daily reminder of why I bought a Fiat, but in all honesty I bought it for it's super cute looks, I think the bad reviews are unfounded and highly recommended Fiat despite them."
"Great Car for a Great Price  I've been a fan Fiats for years, mainly because I always thought they were just so cute. When it came around to buying a new car, I was more inclined to Fiat because the bang-for-the-buck factor- I tell people that constantly, and it's one of the reasons I recommend Fiat so much. How many brand new cars can you get for less than $20k, taxes and fees included? Not many. One of my favorite things about my 2016 Fiat 500 Easy is the turning radius. The smaller size of the car combined with the tight-turning ability allows me to make a U-turn in the tightest of spaces with ease. It's zippier than I thought it would be too! I decided against the Sport and Abarth because I don't personally need the extra power (that, and it might be tempting), but the acceleration is just fine and SO MUCH FUN. Another one of my favorite features is the space inside- I recently went on a 6-hour road trip with a passenger, dog, 1 luggage, and a dog bed and we all fit wonderfully. Just fold the back seats down and bam, you basically have a mini SUV. I'm still surprised at how well this car handles in snow and rain. It's not GREAT in snow, but I was pleasantly surprised for how well it did in 2-5 inches. In rain it's fine, however I do find going over the large, unavoidable puddle to be terrifying because this car is small and light. However, it feels good to drive- what I mean is although the car itself feels light in snow and rain, it is SOLID. Whether you're driving or in the backseat, Fiat's feel like quality vehicles to be in. The interior is beautiful with the houndstooth fabric seats, comfortable, high quality, and durable. Sure, the backseat isn't the greatest for comfort as the seats are slightly firm, but it's better than you'd think. It's quiet, gets great gas mileage and is a smooth ride. My only negatives are that in cold weather it takes a long time to warm up, and the blindspot when looking over your shoulder at odd angled intersections is bad. Overall, the style, the drive, price, comfort/interior make me love this car so much. I highly recommend."
"Surprisingly adequate and just a little fun too  Spouse and I found ourselves in a rush and needing a rental car.  The only car immediately available was a Fiat 500 with automatic.  We took it.  On a 100 mile road trip to the event venue, the car proved to be more than adequate to the task.  While acceleration was slow, once at speed the car maintained interstate speeds without trouble.  We drove 80 and even 85mph, passing many more powerful cars.  If you know how to drive a small engine, this thing will do the job.  It was comfortable for two and luggage space was adequate for a long weekend trip."
"Great Car for the Money!  The new 2017 500C Pop is the same as the 2016 500C Easy.  I ended up purchasing the 2016 Easy, because there was one in a color I liked at the closest dealership.  This model is an extremely affordable way to have a convertible, manual transmission, cruise control, great climate control, and bluetooth (U connect is super user friendly, I've never had a vehicle with bluetooth and started using it the day I bought the car).  I have enjoyed shifting gears in my 500C IMMENSELY, and I'm sure the experience is similar in the 2017 Pop.  I honestly don't miss all the extras the lounge offers, because I'm not a fan of leather seats (freezing in the winter when I leave for work around 6:20 A.M.).  I also love the simple knobs for A/C and heat, as well as the interior air filter, etc.  The design of the interior is simple and intuitive.  Plus, the 500C offers the best of both worlds in practicality and owning a convertible."
"Not A Bad Ford  I bought this car last summer thinking the v6 would be enough power but it's not! If you have the money go get the 4.6 v8. It isn't all bad, the body style is tight so I would recommend this car because it's Not Bad For A Ford!"
"“My angry little Car” part 2  I just want to say that Brian’s review titled “my angry Little Car” is the best summary of the abarth fiat 500. I’ve owned mine for 3 years and almost 40k miles and it’s been one of the best cars and nearly trouble free I’ve ever owned. It is definitely a little beast to barrel around town in yet it’s also really comfortable. I don’t truly understand how that is even possible, but I can drive several hundred miles on road trips and still have a good time and it’s relatively smooth and comfy all things considered! 🚙🚙🚙🚗🚗🚗"
"My angry little car  Here's the thing--there are a lot of cars with more room, better build quality, more cache, better reliability, and more room. There are cars that have way more updated electronics, navigation, etc. and are more functional in terms of rear seat space, ergonomics and the like. None of them will be more fun than this car. None of them will make you smile, laugh, look forward to driving them, talk to people about them, or write a review. The Abarth (mine is a 2016 automatic in yellow) puts fun first and functionality second, but don't take that to mean it's a toy or not a good everyday car. The automatic is a hoot (I own three other stick shift cars including a Porsche 911 in NYC) and blips the throttle with a roarty exhaust backfire when you get on the brakes. It pulls hard in point-and-squirt traffic when in ""Sport"" mode (the only mode you should be in) and hugs off-ramps like velcro to wool. It's fun. No one looks twice at your Mini Cooper S or your GTI. I catch people looking at this yellow bee all the time. The amazing thing is how good the ride is. Short wheelbase and stiff springs don't add up to comfort, but on the highway and terrible pavement, those dual-mode shocks work their magic and it is amazing. Seriously. Front seat space is good, visibility is great (a by-product of the high seating position) and when you fold the rear seats down (or delete them) it's like the world's smallest SUV. It's as much car as you want, but no more car than you need 94% of the time. Can humans fit in the back? Better than you think...but it's tight. Can I park anywhere? Yes. Do what I did--find a used one with less than 5K miles on it, with a full factory warranty, let someone else take the depreciation hit, and drive off into the sunset. Does the exhaust sound better than a Ferrari? Yes. Is it fast? Not really, no. Does it know it? No. It's like the chihuahua who thinks it's a Pit Bull, but it's tongue-in-cheek. It's fun. It's probably just what you need."
"Sufficient, efficient, and cute!  I drove a mini-SUV before this, and it seemed ridiculous to cart that much vehicle around just to and from work (7 mi. each way). I went ""minimalist"" with the Fiat Pop and I love it, so far! I get twice the gas mileage, I love the big windows and having such a great view of the parameters of my car. I'm 5'1"" tall, with very short legs. This car fits me well, but there is a lot of leg room to work with for those who are taller. I have planned a couple of large events, and everything I needed, including two coolers worth of food, fit in the back, with room to spare. I love fitting into tight parking spots with ease, and I love the look of this little car! NO REGRETS, truly! I will offer these considerations for others, though: the ride is noisy compared to my SUV which offered a nearly-silent ride, I have to turn up my radio to hear it over my AC, the road, etc., and making phone calls on bluetooth is ok, unless I'm on a really noisy road and blasting the A/C, then I have to really turn up the phone volume and yell a bit, to have a clear conversation. The tools for tracking trip miles, setting the clock, etc. are not intuitive, and the owner's manual is only minimally helpful for these. I see what professional reviewers mean when they say this car isn't as ""powerful"" in it's normal mode as other cars, but I don't need a crazy amount of power. Mine drives fine on the freeway, and if there's heavy traffic and I feel like I might need to do some extra lane changing, passing, or maneuvering, the ""Sport"" mode gives me everything I need. I like getting great mpg, so I only use that when I'm in heavy freeway traffic. Otherwise, the car drives comfortably enough for me at 65 mph without Sport mode. When I shift from reverse to drive, after backing out of my driveway, I have to give the car a second before I accelerate or I will sometimes get a slight delay when I hit the gas. It's not bad, and I've adjusted to this, it's just something to note if you're a demanding driver who can't wait a second. I'm truly happy when driving this little car, I gladly choose it over the bigger gas hog I used to drive, I love the eco/minimalist values it fits with for me, and I'm happy to be seen with it, even at work where people are judged by such things. If you want a tiny car, you're a safe driver, and you like keeping things kind of simple, get one of these! I have no regrets!"
"Love this FIat  Fun to drive, minimal maintenance, great for parking (small), affordable."
ILove my 2nd Fiat  I enjoyed tbe first Fi at 500 pop so much I bought a second.
"The little car that could  In city traffic it is small enough to avoid obstacles, and handling on the sharp curves of country roads is more than economy, actually sporty.  Sure the 100hp engine will need you to do a bit of shifting to keep up, but exercise is good for you.  In the winter snow of upstate New York, the car got me to work sometimes even before the plows cleared the roads."
"look elsewhere for engaging, fun ride..  rented this car over a weekend and drove through windy roads and highway. it was an utterly uninspiring ride. the engine was barely able and had noticeable turbo lag - like GTI's of old. handling was disappointing with heavy roll in turns and serious understeer. the manual transmission / clutch pedal felt like sponge - very imprecise, very little feedback, not the least reassuring. i had high hopes that this would be at least a fun ride and it turned out to be incredibly uninspiring. should have kept my faithful MX-5 NC..."
Best car ever  I rented one during Christmas and really loved the car so I tracked one down same year and color
"FIAT Customer Service is awful  THIS REVIEW IS EXCLUSIVELY FOR FIAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. I had the worst experience with a certified FIAT dealership, LITHIA Dodge in Las Cruces New Mexico, 2 hours away from where I live, for a safety recall on the clutch on my perfectly functioning car. The awful service caused my clutch to fail completely. It left me stranded on the highway miles from home. I had to push it off the road and have it towed to my house. We fought with FIAT to have it towed back, possibly to another dealership, but FIAT instead towed it back to the same one. It took 2 weeks after that to have my car repaired. Two week of calls with no return calls or information from FIAT to know what was going on. We gave them phone numbers and email, but it was my husband and me who had to contact them to get ANY information.  The case manager misrepresented some information, that our case was going to be escalated and that never happened. Nobody cared that I lost three days of work without pay and initially they told me that I could rent a car and ask for a ""possible"" return. The customer service is plain awful. I hate to say it, but I regret buying a FIAT.  I used to love my little car, but now I can't trust it anymore."
"500 Turbo - anti-Yaris, anti-Fit, anti-boring.  The 500 turbo - slotting in between the non-turbo models on the low-end, and more powerful turbo Abarth model on the high end, is definitely a bit of a ""goldilocks"" fit for people interested in commuting. This is my second FIAT purchased new, and I'm generally pretty pleased with the car. My one modification is the exhaust system like that of the Abarth - a loud, open exhaust. This car will turn heads because of the sound - in a good way (it doesn't sound like a fart-can Civic from Fast and the Furious, but more like the sensational Alfa Romeo 4C). In any case, this car is a competent handler once you get used to the high-riding seats. It's easy to drive in stop-and-go traffic with simple hydraulic clutch that has nice progressive engagement, and a snappy five-speed stick with fairly close ratios. If you're nice, this is a car easily capable of beating it's EPA ratings, especially on the freeway, where I've seen averages approach 45mpg. And even if you're naughty, you're still going to struggle to do worse than 25mpg city which is great fuel economy for a turbocharged car with a close-ratio gearbox being driven inefficiently. With the seats folded you're going to be able to carry plenty of groceries, and even with them up, you can fit luggage for two on a weekend getaway. Yes, the newer Fiats can stream audio over bluetooth and have infotainment stuff, but that's not the point of this car. What this thing is is simple: it's the cheapest performance-oriented turbo car for sale in the US, and it's a real driver's car. Your money is buying not just the 240,000rpm turbo which pushes 15-18psi of boost, but you're getting a forged crankshaft and pistons, with oil sprayers to keep those pistons cool. You get twin intercoolers, an upgraded transmission, and the most notable thing - upgraded brakes (bigger rotors, performance pads). The brakes are among the grabbiest and firmest you'll find in anything for sale for less than $40,000. They are probably the best brakes, period, on a car that stickers for < $20k. All of this makes for a compelling little car that wants you to be happy and have fun. If you look at a grey Yaris, or silver Fit and think that cars like that are a punishment, this is the car you want. It's a pitbull puppy that wants to tear the face off of your coworker's Fiesta. It wants you to take the backroads and have a laugh. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and reminds you to live life and have fun. Now, a final word about these cars: in the same way that they're not boring Honda or Toyota products in the ways mentioned above, they are very Italian in one other way - they need a little TLC. Mine has had a few little things (power window motor needing adjustment, bluetooth software issues) dealt with under warranty. If you look at other reviews, people seem to lose their cool about this stuff, which is unfortunate because it can happen with any car. Especially if you decide to buy a turbo car (any turbo car, not just a Fiat), be aware that maintenance matters a lot more, as does paying attention to things like fluids. Turbo cars like the Fiat may use a little oil (consume, not leak)  between oil changes - it's a good idea to keep an eye on it. The sticky Pirelli tires that come on this car from the factory aren't going to last 50,000 miles like the crappy eco tires on the Yaris. But if you love cars, and are willing to spend a little extra effort and patience loving this one, it's get to to 50,000 smiles, guaranteed.update 02.26.2018: my car has not had any significant mechanical faults, but I have had two dealership visits for warranty-related service. The first replaced a leaking radiator hose; this is a fairly common issue with these cars. Not a big deal, just got it repaired and was on my way.The second was an ECU electrical fault whereby the car was throwing check engine lights repeatedly for misfires, etc., when there was no actual mechanical fault. They reflased the ECU after doing a lot of diagnostics to rule out any mechanical problem, and no mechanical problem was found. Fiat of Albuquerque does great work, and they do it efficiently!Beyond that: new tires at 21k miles and 41k miles. New front brakes (wear related) at 37k mi. New spark plugs at 32k mi; really important for a turbo car. Given that it's a performance-oriented car and I am driving with high performance tires, slotted brakes, etc., this car has been really cheap to maintain. :)"
"Good car  I bought this car 1 1/2 years ago, after doing a lot of research. And so far I am very satisfied with it. It is a Consumer Reports ""Good Bet"" as it seems to a reliable vehicle. It is a sharp looking car, with lots of potential if you can afford to upgrade it. It is fun to drive in the snow with snow tires on. "
"Get the Turbo if you want a little pep!  Cool little car.  Perfect for in town and work commutes.  I'm married with no kids and our other auto is a mazda CX-5, so storage or backseat space aren't an issue for me because I can take the Mazda when I need it.  If the Fiat will be your principle vehicle I suggest giving some consideration to your stuff and people transporting needs, as it's not equipped for much.  Having said that though, I'm a big dude who is high waisted (long torso and short legs :( and I fit just fine in the front seat.  Also, I recently gave my teenaged niece and her two friends a ride across town and they said it they were fine.  I wouldn't plan on stuffing full grown adults back there though.     The 500 offers three power/speed levels: base (101 hp), turbo (135hp) & Abarth (160hp).  I tested all three and found the Goldilocks fit with the midlevel turbo.  It's speedy but not as noisy or tightly wound suspension-wise as the Abarth.  Some days I wish I'd bought the Abarth, but then I quickly remind myself I'm not 25 anymore and can get a speeding ticket almost as easily in the Turbo.  It's definitely got pep, and as I understand it, is the same drivetrain as the Abarth, just detuned for 25 fewer hp.  Bluetooth and HVAC systems work well.  The Beats stereo system isn't quite as powerful as I expected, but it sounds great and again, I'm not 25 anymore, so extra loud music with extra thumping bass probably isn't good for me anyway :)  As sub-compacts go this thing has plenty of personality. If you're in the sub-compact market, definitely check out the 500."
Everyone needs a fiat  I rented one a year or so ago for an 800+ trip. I really liked how it handled and the gas mileage was awesome. So I saved up and bought my own.
"My Fiat 500 Pop  I bought my Fiat new in 2014. I have had it ever since and it now has 30,200 miles. I have had no problems with the car. It has been wonderful for gas mileage, easy to drive and park."
"Great LITTLE Car  If you looking for a sports car this is not what you want.  The 500 is efficient, easy to park and peppy with the 5-speed.  Plenty of room for 2 and I am a big guy.  This little car brakes and drives well.  It was not built for acceleration so even with a 5-speed is not fast but adequate.  My last car of this size was the Ford Fiesta ST which was more cramped had a horrible ride quality although much faster.  The car seems to perform better on premium grade fuel.  At a 10 gallon capacity on the tank it will not break your wallet to by better gas and performance is much improved.  I had a hick up with the blue tooth system in the car after the install of Apple 9.3 on my phone. I just disconnected the battery cable for 10 minutes and the system reset itself.  If you want fun and style this is a great car.  Space is limited for more than 2 adults and so is storage.  If you need a small car for mostly in town use this a great choice and 2015 brought some great improvements to the dash and radio.  I average 36-39 MPG all the time as stated this using premium fuel."
"Give this car a chance, you won't be dissapointed  The big deal with these cars are the value for the money. It's a very capable car when you maintain it and drive it responsibly. I drive my 15 pop with manual transmission 120 miles a day. At 19k miles I have had no problems. The car handles incredibly well on curvy roads, and it has adequate acceleration. I love flying buy more expensive cars on winding roads because they are over priced 2 ton behemoths! As a car guy who just came from a 300hp car, it takes some getting use to,  but, once you realize how much better the mpgs are (36-40highway)  and the handling improvement, it's actually more fun to drive than my 12 challenger. It has torque so going up bridges and hills is actually easier than other cars.  The interior style is a great way to be received everyday.  My car has a red and white interior and the wife loves it and anyone who rides in it loves it.  Much better than the bland silver and black also rans from toyota or mazda. You will be surprised how much you can do with this little car. it's a hatchback so you can carry quite a bit when you fold down the seats.  So in my opinion give these cars a chance."
"Charlie Brown  Last I posted was back in 2014 when I bought the fiat 500 pop for $17,000. Three years later I still have He same love/hate relationship with my car. Let's talk about the cons first, 1. Cup holder are not practically laid out in the front of the car two large drinks cannot sit next to each other. 2. Car feels a bit under powered, however if you drive the automatic in the standard mode it does much better! You can buy the Abarth and have more power, but if you have a pop like me just switch from auto to the standard mode and you will be fine. I tinted my windows to limo tint, it makes a huge difference in the summmer! I don't have to run my AC on high, which allows me to conserve on fuel. Let's talk about the positives! 1. Small and economical I can park anywhere I want, people let me in to traffic because I'm small, and people like to smile because they think the car is cute. 2. There are many color options, and this car is customizable for those who like to tune their engines and lower their cars. 3. Gas mileage is decent I average anywhere between 28-34 depending on where I'm driving and the conditions of the road. 4. Maintenance, is awesome the only things I have replaced on my fiat has been the battery, left headlight and left tail light. In three years that's pretty good! I use full synthetic oil, and only put cheveron gas in my car. 5. Room in the car is enough for daily life, I wouldn't say the car is family friendly for those who have larger families, however my wife, daughter and I fit in here comfortably. I hope this helps you in deciding if the fiat 500 is a good juice for you. I'm glad I bought mine, and I would do it again!"
"Fiat usa is not customer friendly!  I bought my 2015 fiat 500 pop six months ago from Car Pros Fiat of Renton, that's when my troubles started... at the first rain I found out that my car has a leak, car did not have even 500 miles when I took it to get serviced, in staid of giving me a new car they repaired it, and this is only the beginning.... stereo problem, done the software update no changes, had the engine check light that went on,  the heater takes 20 MIN to defog at full power, driver seat latch sticks and now another leak. The car has only 3030 miles and it has been repaired 6 times. Till this moment Fiat USA and the dealership is still giving me the turn around. After a months of calling and sending emails, I finally got an answer from fiat acknowledging that there is problems with this car and they offer an extended warranty... really  you think I will keep a car with so many problems. Now I found water again in the back of my car, it's three times now.THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER .... DO NOT BUY FIAT"
"Fiat USA is NOT customer friendly!  I bought my Fiat 1 year ago. I love the little car! But Fiat is not customer friendly. On 8/27/2015, my engine blew with 28,000 on the car. It took over a month to get it repaired and back to me. Three days later, I gave it back to the dealer, as it was not fixed. The 2nd engine blew. 3 months later, they gave me my car back. The upper management will not contact me. They continue to tell a CSR my options. 1/3 of my ownership has been in the shop, and they don't care. Buyers look elsewhere if you want support. My case number is 28015096."

"Ciao Bella  Inexpensive fun transportation. Replaced a 92 Miata with this and it's as much fun to drive. Not a lot of pop in the pop but I smile every time I drive it. Lots of front seat room; rear seats comfortable for kids only. Good manual transmission. Short turning radius. Small for city driving and rides better than expected on the freeway.  I like the styling, not a typical boring low end car. Only have 3000 miles so I can't speak about reliability.Update: 15000 miles.  Reliable so far. Still makes me smile and lots of fun to drive. Resale value is poor but if it functions like this for 8-10 years it was a steal."
"My Experience  I bought this car with 16,000 miles on it for $9,000 dollars from a friend. It has been nothing but amazing since that day. I have added a cold air intake, tinted the windows and put on an amazing exhaust. I get about 30  miles per gallon in the highway and about 14 in the city (without any air conditioning). I had to change the CCRM which ran for about 140 dollars , but this seems to be a really rare problem, I was just unlucky. I would recommend different rims and tires, because traction in the rain is horrible; I have crashed 3 times. All of which kept my car in perfect condition, but ruined the other cars lol."
"Great little car  I was looking at another car in the used car section of the Fiat dealer. I liked the way the Fiat looked so decided to give it a drive. Turned out I really liked this cute little car. So bought it that day. Red with automatic transmission. I can see where some of the interior parts will likely not hold up well, but for the money and styling, I think it's a great deal. I don't really drive a lot anymore and this is really perfect for me. Comfortable, peppy, and fun to look at. This is a follow up to the review I did last year. I have put about 7000 miles on her, like I said I don't drive much and she is still doing great. I really have no complaints at all about this car. We even traded in our Mini for the 500X and we love it as well."
"2015 FIAT 500 Pop (1.4 l gas, 5 Speed Manual)  With a comfortable, well designed interior, excellent handling characteristics, and 40 MPG even without any hybrid technology, this is probably my favorite little car that I have ever owned. It fits myself, my wife, and my daughter’s car seat with ease, even being so small, and still has room for our stuff if we are reasonable about what we bring with us. It also has excellent technology for its low price. It is easy to stream my Apple Music subscription or my Google Maps directions to the stereo using Bluetooth. Unlike many other, even larger, vehicles, it is almost as if this car’s interior was designed with actual human occupants in mind, as it has plenty of drink holders in convenient locations, and all interior controls are easy and convenient to access while driving. In short, this car is an absolute pleasure to drive, whether on a short drive around town or a long multi-state freeway vacation. Unfortunately, it is not, and has never been a reliable vehicle, which really ruins a lot of the fun of owning it. The clutch pressure plate snapped and the car had to be towed to the dealership to have the clutch replaced within the first week of buying the vehicle new. The clutch is not sufficiently covered by warranty as a so-called “wear item,” but mine was replaced at no charge. The transmission developed a nasty grinding noise when shifting gears and the entire transmission had to be replaced before the first oil change. The car now has a problem with surging in speed when in first and second gear, that the dealership was unable to fix and says is “normal for this vehicle.” Trying to control something that surges in acceleration like a bucking bronco through parking lots is not fun."
"Perfec t little car  We have driven this little Italian car and we just love it very reliable no problems at all just gas and oil change, very good on gas confortable city car."
"My fourth Fiat 500...  I've owned four 500s since the model was introduced in 2012. Started with a Pop, went to an Abarth, then to a Sport, and am back in the fold with a new 2015 Sport. Subtle refinements to the 2015 are much appreciated, especially the new electronic instrument cluster. I have owned way too many cars but I think the Fiat may be my favorite all around vehicle. FUN to drive, wonderful design inside and out, frugal with fuel, easy to maneuver and park, great driving position and sight lines. Get the Sport model, engage the ""sport"" button, and enjoy one of the best kept secrets in the new car market."
Not a good value  Car does not hold its value. Definitely buy used.
Nice car except for a couple of things  I test drove the Abarth and the regular 500 C. The Abarth exhaust was too noisy. Too loud a rumble. There should be an option if you want it tuned or not. Was getting on my nerves just on the test drive. The steering wheel does not telescope which is a must. And finally it's hard to believe it's 2016 and these cars don't have rear view cameras. Otherwise nice cars for the money.
"MY LITTLE RED RACY ABARTH  You ge a lot of bang for the buck with Fiat.  We obviously love them since this is our fourth one!  We just keep upgrading!  with my Abarth, I can smoke a Corvette off the line ~ then I'm toast!  But, I'll still have gas when I get there!"
"have owned 2 Abarths 2013 5spd and 2015 6spd auto  I have owned 2 Abarth ( a 2013 white w/ red stripes/mirrors ,5 spd manual- 160hp/170 ft/lbs and current 2015 Red w/black stripes/mirrors,6spd automatic- 157 hp/183 ft/lbs,optional extra cost 16 in. wheels) . Now at 23k miles  on red. >>No<< problems. Average around town 28 mpg (premium) but have been as high as 36 mpg on trip ( at about  65 mph).  Quick with sport button on as it supposedly adds 20 ft/lbs torque. and you can feel the difference with sport button on . All three dealerships ( Baltimore,MD, Tysons Corner,VA and Melbourne,FL have been very good overall.  I came from a 2011 MINI Cooper S 6spd. The MINI was more sophisticated but the ABARTH is a true  hoot ,especially hearing the exhaust.  FIAT /ABARTH- I suggest direct injection ( not older port injection), suggest IRS (not beam axle rear suspension) ,  suggest 17in wheels standard (not 16in) , suggest better gauge design . (Although 2015 was improved you are not there yet...needs to be like the 595 and 695 in Europe). Suggest improved exhaust ( a ""T intersection"" at rear... really?) , Suggest KONI shocks on all four wheels.(not sure if this was addressed on 2016 on) , Suggest bigger brakes front and rear. Suggest standard rear ""sway bar"" needs to be much stiffer to reduce lean in corners.  FIAT has reduced price to now start at 20 k which seems quite fair.  If you are seeking a harder core and cheaper alternative to the MINI Cooper S then try this.  The ABARTH is priced closer to a MINI Cooper 1.5 134 hp /162 ft/lbs than the Cooper S."
"A Better Way to Start Your Day  FUN is the best way to describe this car, you will smile and have a good time. Own this car since April 2016 and its brought nothing but joy, it has a great car community, so many mods, the overall experience is pretty special. The Italians know how to strike the right emotions when creating a car. I took out the rear seats(about 50lbs) and added Speedlab Rear Diffuser, also added a Torque Arm Insert which really makes the car feel more premium and stout. Go test drive one and you'll see why its worth talking about."
"Owning two Abarths  I have now owned two ABarths...a 2013 5spd basic car and a 2015 6spd automatic also basic . I have tended to like the automatic better and have just returned from a long trip getting 36.5 mpg at about 75mph average speed. 30mpg around town driving. The auto has 183ft lbs torque ( more than the 5spd cars)  as well which adds to the ease in drivability and it is a 6spd auto ( vs the 5spd manual). The car needs an update at this point (IE direct injection, a dual scroll turbo for quicker spool up, an independent rear suspension and it should have had Koni shocks all around ( now since changed for 2016) right from the beginning. The sway bars should have been stiffer as well especially the rear sway bar ( which can be resolved through the aftermarket.- a wise choice which does help minimize understeer) . You will need to keep the tire pressure at 40psi all around to get best performance. Mine had the optional 16 in black wheels ( not the 17inchers ) so the higher pressure was not objectionable. The car is a fun ,raucous ,unique little runabout but is only ""fast"" when in sport mode ( worth 20ft lbs. more torque when sport button is pushed).  After owning two I would not buy another unless there was a total top to bottom update as the original was released around 2008 in Europe. It is now overdue. Not many drive these so you will need to be dedicated."
"Just simply amazing!  I'm 16 and I bought a 2000 Mustang GT as my first car. Having a 5 speed manual makes this car a blast to drive. The car handles beautifully in dry weather, have yet to drive it in anything wet. Since I am in high school, it's nice seeing heads turn everywhere I go. The full Flowmaster exhaust sure helps bring attention to my car. Only thing I have to say is it is a eye-catcher, especially for the COPS. So drive safe and be careful!"
"Love it  I've had my Abarth about 6 weeks now.  I park in a crowded parking lot at work, as far as I can tell its the only one on the lot.  It stands out.  Mine is red with the upgraded $500 sixteen inch wheels.  The best feature of this car is its compelling value and its unbeatable fun factor.  I was originally shopping for the Sport which I test drove and loved, probably should have bought for the gas mileage alone and almost equally cool in appearance and appeal as the Abarth.  But I loved the Abarth too, particularly the exhaust, badging, and leather seats.  Keep in mind the exhaust is great, exhaust porn to the extreme, great at drive thru's and underpasses, will put a smile on you face every day, best described as a friendly companion and not at all intrusive.  Its absolutely fab!  If I'm careful I can average around 35 MPG on a tank with 60% of that a suburban commute to work.  I keep it out of sport mode for the most part just to save on fuel.  The Beats audio system is good, very good, but I can't imagine the base system also not being very good.  I did not do the comparison before I purchased.  Seems all the 500s I was interested in had the Beats so I just went with it.  Also, no backup camera, but it does have the backup warning feature, a $250 option that I feel is very useful and well worth it.  Driving this car with the stick is easy and fun.  I think it's is the only way to go because of the gain in MPG and the fun factor.  Also, the fit and finish is perfect.  I examined it with a magnifying glass, no paint blemishes of any kind, no gaps in the panels or doors (as compared to my 2005 Maxima purchased new, a Nissan embarrassment for which I will never give them a second chance.  Shame, shame, shame on Nissan).  The ride quality is also great, no rattles at all, a little bouncy because of the small wheel base, but an able and compliant suspension as well as a handling marvel.  Road noise is minimal, this is a small car from the outside but doesn't sound like it from the inside.  I test drove a Honda Fit, didn't like it but was willing to buy based alone on Honda reliability.  The front suspension gave the impression of the wheels trying to come thru the wheel wells let alone the road noise.  This car may be reliable and have great reviews, but I don't see why.  It's a cheap car with a cheap price that will make you feel cheap as long as you own it.  Also, the dealer played the online bait and switch despite having the online quote in their very hands.  This happened at two dealerships within a week.  Done with arrogant Honda... forever!  Thank you Honda for being rotten, I think I've gotten a better car for a better price.  Also, the electronics are all that.  Perhaps all new cars now come with sophisticated electronics, but please be aware, this was an inexpensive car where the fun, price, and appearance are its strengths.  The electronics are a bonus that bring it up to the standards of much more expensive cars.  Also, the interior and electronics are intuitive and easy to use.  This is no accident, it is well thought out design.  It's not just a lot of features thrown together haphazardly like my Maxima for bragging rights.  This is a comfortable car in many, many respects.  The high roof line allows for more space then can be imagined.  This car does not feel cramped and you sit up high, its easy in and easy out which gives great comfort to my aching right hip.  I also looked at the new Civic.  A great car if you don't mind spending north of $27K for the one you want with the wheels you want, and you have to do the limbo to get into the darn thing for the privilege of nearly sitting on the ground.  Its great once you're in but you may need 911 to get out.  My hip and checkbook feel the Fiat is not just the better car, its the smarter car too... and better looking.   I can't say enough about how great a value I feel this car is.  Also, this is a specialty car and the dealer lots are full of unsold Abarths.  Most people I think will fall for the 500 but the real car people, of which there are fewer, will look to the Abarth with an appreciation of how different and special this car really is.  Consequently, huge and disproportionate discounts are to be had.  My car listed for $27,495 (no sunroof, no navigation), final price $22,295.  I think I overpaid and could have done better by about $2,000 without even asking had I used some online tools.  But I don't feel bad about the purchase.  I liked the dealer, patient and kind, easy and nice.  The follow up has been nothing less then remarkable.  I feel like I've joined the family and a special community.  The dealer followed up and FIAT themselves too after receiving several welcome gifts.  Any problems, call and a person will answer who is able to give answers.  I will remember this as a pleasant experience, it the car proves itself as reasonably durable which I think it will, then I'll stick with FIAT.  They have put a priceless smile on my face."
"Really love this little car!  I really love this little car! It is super fun to drive. Not in a super-car kind of way, in a goofy, balls to the wall, don't give a damn kind of way. It's always ""on"" meaning it's always ready to play, like a puppy dog. It is comfortable enough for long hauls and with the standard 16"" wheels it tracks like a little freight train down the freeway, really! On highway trips I'm getting around 33-35 mpg which is exactly the EPA rating and around town probably more like 22-26 mpg (much more dependent on how you drive it). The only thing I'd change would be to redesign the center vertical tunnel stack thing because it does interfere a bit with my knees (I'm a big guy, weighing in at 300 lbs and 5'10"")."
"great little car  I've had this for around 8-10 months, so I can't really say much on long term reliability, but its a fun little car.No parking aids on my, but then again whats the point. just aiming it in the general direction is good enough. It's small enough where i can just go ""Eh, good enough"" and it is.It's a quick car, and still has decent acceleration at 60+ mph. It handles and grips well, is a lot of fun as a daily driver, well at least when there isn't too much traffic.The driving position is quite high, coming from my 98' BMW, but it somehow just adds to the fun.I've seen people complain about the lack of space, and granted, the rear seats kinda suck, but there's more than enough room if you only need to drive yourself or one other person around, not to mention it just is a physically smaller car which I like.If I'm careful, I can get 36-37 mpg between city and highway with traffic, could probably get 38-39 if there wasn't any traffic, but I generally don't bother with it. More fun not worrying about mileage, and even when being rather liberal with the gas it still gets decent mileage. Get's about the same range as my BMW did, I use a higher grade gas, and it still costs ~15$ less to fill up the tank.I think the ride is quite good, though my dad said the BMW felt like a rock (never really noticed myself). It makes a nice sound making it somewhat ridiculous, but not over the top. It's not super loud or anything, but it's enough to put a smile on my face.I couldn't be happier with it,Edit~2 years later, been reliable enough, it can go through a bit of oil, not a leak, just keep an eye on it. Also fairly easy to modus probably hit the gas more than I should, and I'm almost always in sport mode I get a combined of about 30-31mpg."
"Awesome little commuter/city car  I got mine used.  Fiat's rather undeserving reputation for poor quality works out for those of us buying used.  Car was probably 33000 with every single option available new and I picked it up for 14000 with 15k miles and 2 years old.  So, not the car you want to absorb initial price on.  Even if the price stayed strong like a honda, 33k would be a bit much for a car this size and power.  A great MX-5 could be had for less than that.  PRACTICALITY-  It can seat 4 as long as they're all middling size.  I'm 6'3"" and can fit my teen children and wife in there.  Not for long, but it can be done.  Not much cargo space on the cabriolet, but enough to do a grocery run without putting the seats down.  Gets good fuel mileage without giving up power.  INTERIOR AMENITIES- Beats Audio is pretty great.  I've owned a lot of cars and this has the best stereo ever.  I thought the HK in the Mini S was nice.  No where near.  Controls are simple.  Not many options.  Has an easy to access menu in the gauge cluster to adjust beeps and DRL etc.  Instant and trip MPG.  Normal car computer stuff.   Bluetooth is lacking.  Technically you can use it to connect phone calls.  But NO BT STREAMING AUDIO to the stereo.  Unforgivable.  Does have the requisite USB and 1/8"" jack though.  Seats (leather) are comfortable.  Height adjustable (a la VW).  Passengers complain about the rear headrests.  The rear seats are almost perpendicular to the ground and the headrests stick out in front of them.  You pretty much have to lean forward.  BUT... technically its for safety.  Safe isn't always comfortable. The arm rest is only on the drivers seat and is perfect for me.  My wife considers it to be too high (she's short).  It can be stowed if it bothers you.  Seats are bolstered but not straight jacket.  You sit high for a sports car.... but its not a sports car.  Its a hot hatch.  Good visibility.  you never notice how small the car is till you park it or squeeze by into the turn lane that's almost blocked.   DRIVABILITY-  I came out of a mk6 GTI most recently.  The GTI was almost too perfect.  It lacked fun.  You had to bring it to a track to get ""on the edge"" safely.  The abarth isn't an ""est"" car.  Its not the fastest, not the best in corners, its not the most powerful.  What it lacks in power and skid pad and rapid weight transfer, it makes up for in spades with FUN.   It must be driven on the edge.  You don't sit back and marvel at your speed through the turn.  You earn it.  It handles better than most things on the road and anything in its class, but it doesn't beat your brains out on rough roads.  It has a very sophisticated shock absorber that lets it soak up bumps and still perform.  The shifter is spot on.  Some call it sloppy.  It doesn't offer a lot of feed back, but I've NEVER missed a shift.  Only thing weird about it is that it will let you try to put it  in reverse if you forget its only a 5 speed and try to grab 6th.  When you come to a stop in a 3 point turn, if you quickly shift from forward to reverse you might hear it grind as the transmission spins very freely.   The ASC is VERY intrusive when ""all the way on"".  Starting from a green light can find you bogging down if you try to start quickly at all.  The tiny firm tires try to spin on intersection rubble and the ASC/TSC kicks in and cuts the throttle all but completely.  I generally drive it on ""1 push"".  That is.  Tapping the ASC controls put it in a ""sport"" mode.  It allows a bit of wheel spin and will let you performa an ""L"" turn with the hand brake before it stops you.  It still assists if you start sliding around a corner, or stab the brakes too hard out of a dip.  Push and hold the ASC button for 5 seconds and you're in track mode.  Full off as far as I can tell.  Smoke the tires, pull J turns, drift through chicanes, spin backwards into the gravel or trees.  Not a great idea for the road, but kicks butt on the auto cross circuit.  The ASC has saved me a couple times.  It has my trust.  The noise... OH the noise.  Pops and crackles.  Pull away from the drive up window and you hear the turbo spin up.  Build full boost at anything below maximum torque curve and let off to a satisfying after fire.  The car has NO MUFFLER!  Catalytic converter into down pipe, into a small flex converter---- 6 feet of straight pipe, T to the 2 outlets.  Its obnoxious in confined spaces.  On the road its not even noticeable.  No drone, just a very european crackle.  Blip the throttle between shifts.  Sounds race car.    The pedal box is perfect.  My wife automatically learned to heel toe.  She had never even heard the term before.  It just comes naturally in the 500.  ""I can brake and rev match without taking my foot off the brake"".  Its amazing.  The steering is responsive but not heavy.  The steering wheel could be better.  I can't find a perfect place for my hands.  It wants you to be at 10&2 but I prefer a 9&3.  The car has a bit of body flex and body lean, but nothing dramatic."
"READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY ONE. PLEASE!  Bought last year with 4000 miles on it. No it’s not a miss print, a 2013 with 4K on it. 4 days after owning the car it started to make a ticking noise. Brought it back to the dealer, on the way to the dealer a boost hose came apart, I limped it into the dealer ship. 3 days of diag later they say the inputshaft bearing went out on the transmission. So they put a transmission in it and fix the boost leak. 3 months after owning it the a/c stopped working. It’s been back to the dealer 3 times for that and they can’t find out why. 4 month after owning it the driver’s side window starts to rattle when it’s 1/2 way down. Bring it back to the dealer and they said the window track bolts were loose, they repaired that. Then around 12k the engine starts to consume 2 quarts of oil every 2k miles. So we start to do an oil consumption report, which is basically drop the car off and have a tech check the dip stick. Now we’re at 18k and on the last dipstick check the dealership calls and says it needs an engine. So they order me up and engine and now it’s sitting at the dealership. I also found out when checking out the warranty coverage at the last dipstick check, the selling dealership put an engine in it at 3k and never disclosed it at the  original sale. At this point I called fiat  corporate and started this process. The put me with a case worker. I wanted to turn the car in but apparently fiat does not do buy backs and they wanted to connect me to some one in sales to try to “trade” it in on another product. So at this point my warranty runs out in September of 2019, which I will be trading it in. It’s a very fun car to drive. It’s got snap and hugs the corners very well (after I took the stock parrellies off and put on a set of coopers) which buy the way the tires were shot at 10k. Basically when it’s not at the dealer its fun to drive. Would I buy another fiat product again, hell no! Do your self a favor stay away from fiat."
"Small price, lots of fun/utility/style  I bought my Fiat 500 for $8K with 13,000 miles on the odometer and a few months' warranty left. It was my first used car since the mid 90s. A used Fiat 500 can be a great deal. Things I love: this car has great attention to detail in it's design - it has character and little things that delight, like the white instruments, controls, and steering wheel that make it feel unlike any other car available. The 2013 model has my favorite version of the interior because the dash lights are all orange and match; later models went to a different set of instruments that don't match the radio colors. I've put almost 10,000 miles on mine now going back and forth to work, the gym, and running errands - it has the easiest driving manual transmission I've ever owned and the electric power steering is a pleasure around town. I can always wedge it into that parking spot nobody else can use. You can drive it all out and never get into much trouble, and it has plenty of power for the freeway. The iPod integration, Bluetooth, and stereo are excellent and easy to use. On the down side - the seats have short bottoms and are not the most comfortable things, though that may be personal. Due to the short wheelbase, it can have a busy, sometimes nervous ride compared to a larger car. I feel quite content zipping around town with my little Fiat - it makes me smile. Like most of us, it's faults are the mirror image of it's strengths. I get impeccable, attentive service from my dealer (Fiat of Kirkland, WA)."
"I wasted my money  I bought a new 2013 turbo Fiat with a manual transmission for $21,000. I drove it for 16,000 miles and the shape of the clutch pedal, ruined my left foot. I wanted to sell it but nobody was interested in owning a stick. I ended up selling it back to the dealer I bought it from for just $6100 dollars. While I owned it. I was annoyed with the horn blow when you lock the doors. I wasn't happy that this car did not have a door lock switch in the car. The seat seemed to be on a slant. When I sat straight up I noticed that I wasn't centered with the back rest and The seat wasn't center with the steering wheel.  The designers most of seen these problems. Often, I had trouble getting third gear too. Make sure you really look a car over before you buy. I know I will be."
"Fun, Fuel Effecient and safe  When my wife's' Hyundai blew up after a timing belt failure. We looked around at several sub compact cars that that she could drive confidently. When we tried the Fiat, we walked away from the dealer because the salesman tried to sell us one with a sunroof and I did not fit at all due to the decreased headroom. We later tried a standard pop and I fit perfect. The little Fiat was available in Green which was the wife's most important feature . Safety was mine. It has traction control, 5 airbags, anti lock brakes and great safety ratings. We were rear ended by a impaired driver on the highway and the traction control saved us from a potentially  horrible situation. 6 months later a guy in a mustang ran a red light and smashed into the side..(Southern California Drivers) Both times were minor injuries although I was banged up a bit in the rear end collision. It gets about 30 - 40 MPG with the automatic and is a great value. I would advise anyone NOT TO GET WHEEL COVERS and step up and get aluminum wheels or zip tie those caps to the wheel as they always FALL OFF. irritating...."
Great small car  Fun and economical to drive
"CUTE CAR, DANGEROUS VEHICLE  My car has 24,000 2 years old and the stick shift seized up in the middle of driving. Chrysler advised that it only was warrantied for 1 year. Ridiculous!!!! I will never do business with Chrysler again. If you like their vehicles, do your homework and research all recalls for their automobiles. You will think twice before investing in a car that will create a major vehicle repair during the ""Warranty""."
"Love this car!  I bought my car when it had 38k on it. Have not had any major mechanical issues and I just passed 80k. Have taken the car on a few road trips. It handles well, gets good gas mileage and the sound system is awesome. Am starting to experience a bit of loss in power, sounds like I may have a small exhaust issue towards the front of the vehicle, sometimes now when I shift the brake light comes on momentarily and if I rev the RPM's too high the battery light flashes. But all in all it is a great vehicle."
Happy Fiat owner  Car is a little noisie as far as road noise Other than that it has lots of head room and surprising room to carry things.
"Disappointed  I'm so disappointed in my 2013 Fiat 500 POP. We have enjoyed the car for three-years. In the last few months, we noticed a ticking noise on the right side when the car is in motion so we bring it to Fiat of Manhattan for a check-up. I'm told the entire bottom of the car, including all the rims, are bent - as if the car bottomed-out - resulting in a repair cost of ~$3K. I live in NYC, purchased the car from Fiat of Manhattan. 90 percent of my driving takes place in NYC. I try to avoid potholes when possible - which are everywhere on our NY roads - and I've never hit one that made me say, oops, that broke my car. Now, the Fiat is absolutely horrible when it comes to any bumps. They all feel like you're getting hit by a cement truck. But for a three-year old car that hasn't experienced anything other than driving in NY, I'm astounded that the car wasn't built properly to handle what any other car can. So now we're worried that another three-years from now, we'll be doing this all over again because of a faulty, or cheaply made undercarriage. This makes me sad. I want to love my Fiat, but I'm so angry at the manufactures for marketing a car for city living but not backing it up with the framework of a vehicle that can endure city roads. Boo."
"FIAT Brand makes you feel foolish  It will need to be repaired and don't expect a quick repair or a loaner. Once you buy you are are on your own, they are in no hurry to fix leaving you with the responsibility solely for making a bad decision to buy an infamously poor brand. Had electronic steering repaired several times (4) and at one time had to wait for a bolt to come in that wasn't included with the replacement part- 13 days. No offer for a loaner, no apologies- and was told ""off-the-record"" by one of the Chrysler dealer van drivers to get rid of it before 50K miles. ""You don't want that thing after the warranty is out! ""They consistently make you feel like a fool for buying/leasing a Fiat by not offering to service quick, comfortably or with a loaner.The theme of the ""fool that bought a Fiat"" continued to the last day of ownership when I called the local dealer (Ramsey) to return the car. The first question I was asked if it was where I bought/leased the car, I replied ""no"" I bought at a dealer 40 miles away (since moved). He (later found out he was a Chrysler guy) said that he only accepted ""his own"" customers. I replied I was a customer particularly since all my service and fixes for frequent repairs was done at his dealership. He hung up on me and I wound up driving 40 miles to return the car.Sad part is that had he not interrupted me by asking where I bought the car I would have asked him when the Alfa Romero Sedan (April?) was coming out as I would have considered holding the Fiat a couple more months until it was available for sale. I happily wound up with a new Lexus IS.Signed- Former Fiat customer.1982 Fiat Spider 2000 Pininfarina (first Fiat)2013 Fiat 500T (last Fiat) (RIP)Flushed any remaining loyalty out of my foolish system."
"dont buy one,junk  2013 pop.struts @ 6000,tires replaced @ 6000at my cost (firestone bulges),struts @ 13000,headlights @ 17000,now @ 18000 alt bad,it gos to dealer every other week,got 0% @60 months,its only worth 4000 less than i owe after 3 years,other things have gone wrong,i just didnt list.by far the worst car i have ever owned,the only car ive had that you can feel falling apart .now has 26000,11-8-16 bought new car to replace it with something i can depend on,i had to keep it,none of the dealers want it,one told me""i wouldnt take it if you gave it to me"".if this is the best of fiat,fca will go out of business,in us market"
"Never again  Everything is falling apart from the inside out. I have already needed a new clutch, fuel pump, and steering column. Worst car ever. Loved it in the begining....... great on gas and fun to drive. BUT NEVER would i recomend this to ANYONE. Oh yeah i have under 30,000 miles on this. I'm going to feel terible even selling this to someone."
"I love my FIat!  I have had my little yellow Fiat since October 2013 and have 37,000 miles on her, having driven across country twice. Everyone is amazed at the amount of stuff the little car can carry! The only problem I have had, head lights sprung a leak and CDs get stuck in the player. I have wanted one since seeing one in Italy 15 years ago. When my Toyota 4 Runner with 200,000 miles decided to die, I bought my Fiat. A very happy Fiat owner."
"DO NOT BUY THIS CAR  By FAR the worst car I have ever owned. From the day I drove it off the lot it had nothing but problems. Steering column replaced twice because of thump when i turned the car, struts and strut mounts replaced, starter replaced 3 times, both regulators broke on power windows, same headlight burned out at LEAST a dozen times, wheel bearings replaced twice, jounce bumpers replaced twice and never resolved the issue,broken shock, exhaust kept loosening up,never resolved. The final straw was after only having 11k miles on it the tires needed replacing because of all of the issues ruined them and Fiat did nothing to remedy. Traded the car after 20 months w/11k miles and only got $7500. DO NOT BUY"
"Love my 2013 Fiat  When i purchased my Fiat new in 2013 i did not know much about this car but saw it online went to get it...i have the guacamole green and i am so happy with its performance. I have had  a Honda, Toyota, Chevy, Mitsubishi, and Saturn...but this is the BEST car i have ever purchased. The turbo button for highway driving is awesome. My Fiat is so quick, i always have cars or trucks! Race me...i win at take off! I only have 14k on my car and i have gone to Vegas and Sedona twice...great on gas!"
"2013 Fiat Sport Manual Black on Black w/Leather Seats  We purchased this little beauty new on 12/29/13, so we have owned it now for 15 months.  The wife is 5'2"" and I am 5'11"".  We both fit comfortably whether driving or riding.  The wife is the primary driver and loves everything about this car, the look (with the chrome appearance package) the acceleration (with the manual), the ride comfort (with the leather seating), the upright seating position for a great all around view, and the wonderful handling.  The Sport model is the Fiat 500 to get.  The Sport model offers much better handling than the Pop model, but does not diminish ride comfort, especially when the leather seating upgrade is included. Also, huge difference with ""stick"" vs ""auto""."
"Italian Tardis  I bought a used 2013 with 7k miles and an automatic transmission and use it as our ""fun"" car for my daily work commute. We've got 4 kids and our other car is a minivan so this Fiat is a much needed injection of small car sprightliness and tossable fun.  Great commuter car.  I am amazed at how much ""bigger on the inside"" (for the Dr Who fans) it feels compared to how it looks from outside.  Perhaps it's the tallness of the cabin but the front 2 seats are plenty big for adults, comfortable and well supported. Plus I just like that it's small.  I've owned an SUV and it always felt like I was carrying around a bunch of extra space back there.  Not so with this. "
"Loved it at first...  Purchased my Mustang with less than 20 miles and enjoyed it until I hit the 40K mark. I have taken great care of my car hoping it would last a long time, but it hasn't made a difference. I have owned the car for over four years now and in the last year it has been literally falling apart. I have had problems with the brakes, the passenger door, the power side mirrors, the a/c, and the transmission. The car still turns heads as I approach but the loud engine kills the mood. I did not get my money's worth and I will not buy another Ford."
"2014 500 Pop  I have had the 5-speed Fiat 500 for a few weeks now and so far I am happy. My main concern in getting this car was the quality - but getting a warranty with it eased the pain. When driving alone or in a big city: this is the car to have. It has prominent strengths and weaknesses.This car is not meant for offroad, mountain, or utility driving. It dominates normal streets and freeways though with small size, agility, and economy. "
"Amazing car for the money  I'm very pleased the Fiat 500 Sport thus far. Very comfortable for my 6' frame despite its diminutive size along with better ease of ingress/egress than its rivals. Handles well and is surefooted in snow. Fits in parking spots others won't.Feature rich- AM/FM/CD power windows, a/c, heated mirrors, fog lights, cruise, automatic door locks, Bluetooth and alloy wheels are standard. Excellent fit and finish. Current incentives for 2013 models make the 500 a steal. This is one small car that doesn't feel like a penalty box. It brings a smile to my face every time I drive it."
"Love the retro Pop!  After 2 months of ownership, I can tell you great things about my blue green Pop.It's retro styling is so fun--it makes me smile every time I see it.I love the manual transmission; it is fun to drive and very fuel efficient.I average 36.5 mpg combined, and reached 44mpg using premium gas on a highway only trip.I am still evaluating using premium gas in town, but performance is definitely worth it for a highway trip.The seats are comfortable, and I love all the manual climate control.The bluetooth works well from both front seats.The standard audio system is really good and versatile.There is good headroom without a sunroof for taller drivers."
"A Very Happy Experience  I have now had the Fiat for 30 months. I still love the car. I have had no problems with it,  and the dealership where I bought it gives great service. The only complaint that I have is that with the stock tires, that it does not do well in deep snow. This is only a problem on my street which is not plowed.If Fiat sold the awd 500x with the  six speed in the US, I would buy one.After having had my Fiat 500 for two months, I feel that I know the car well, and can comment on it.This car replaced a turbo diesel car, so needing fast acceleration was not a requirement. The first week of ownership, I put mine and my wife's road bikes on the back and took off on a thousand mile drive to participate in a week long bike ride in Northern Idaho. We had to cross the continental divide, and drive over many types of roads. This car has extremely comfortable seats, and except for the extreme climbs, has enough power. We averaged 35 mpg, for the trip. Since then, it is averaging 35-39 mpg with mostly city driving. We have had no problems, great a/c, and no rattles. Love this CAR"
Truly is more fun to the gallon!  Traded in a 2010 Prius for my 2013 FIAT Pop four-dr hatchback. Bright Yellow. I loved the Prius but did not care for the Service Dept for Toyota in my area.Happy to not have to return to them.My FIAT has six-gears Automatic transmission.It has a Sport Mode button.I live in a hilly region of AR and appreciate the sports-car feel of my FIAT 500.Attended a FIAT Rally recently with 22 FIAT 500's.Great time on mountainous roads!Staff from Landers in Benton AR made it all the more fun. I highly recommend both the car and the people from Landers.
Lotsa! FUN!  This is a good (great) driving car.A pleasure to drive.I have the basic model and still it has quite abit extra's.I'am a driver and like the fun of driving a solid steering car.This one goes from a regular driving car to a Ferrari when the sports button is engaged/push at the console.Great for curvy roads and parking lots or anytime.On the hwy I leave it regular mode and just cruise.Did I tell you it has cruise control too.Anyway don't push the OMG button unless -are you experienced - (Hendrix)I have the auto transmission and this is great. I'am 60 and this shifts a lot in the sports mode (OMG).There you have it.
"C'mon it's lot's of fun  I am an old dude 53, I have a Light seafoam green with ivory interior 2013 500 pop 5 speed with a sunroof , alum wheels, and beats stereo , on top of all the other goodies that just come standard on this car . It rocks , fun , fast , stable, quiet , I've owned one of just about everything over the years from Pintos to Porsches , literally. This is hands down one of my favorites. My only complaint is that the turbo doesn't come in ANY color I want!after 11,000 miles in just under 3 months not a single problem , rattle , or squeak . Maybe I bite the bullet and go for an Orange Turbo at the end of the year, anything but silver or grey . I'm sick of seeing silver cars ."
"2103 Pop 10 day review   Purchased my 2013 10 days ago. I'm impressed and very excited.The value of the Pop for the money cannot be overstated.After researching many used cars and new I was thrilled to pay $15,560 out-the-door for a new car with 4 year warranty, comfortable ride, fun ride, cruise control, power windows, usb, bluetooth... It does great on freeways and curvy roads.The Sport button is especially fun on the curvy roads.Parking and maneuvering is great. Excellent gas mileage - exceeds the 31-40 mpg ratings.The car meets the needs and satisfies the wants.The engine delivers. I pulled the rear headrests and keep the rear seat down and enjoy the open space in the back. "
"Ask the man who has owned all three...  I never thought I'd be writing this review, but I am. I traded my 2012 Pop (which I loved) for a 2013 Abarth, figuring more is always better. In my case, this turned out not to be true. The Abarth is a very cool car, but in real world daily driving it was just too much for this old guy. The heavy controls, harsh ride (on the optional 17 inch wheels), and painful seats did me in and I traded it for a 2013 Sport after a brief ownership experience. The Sport works better as a real world daily driver and has more than enough upgrades to justify picking it over a Pop. I'm very pleased with my decision."
"Pop  I was going to buy another Mazda, but my local Dealer low balled me on my trade.Went to the local Fiat dealer, I had been wanting to test drive the 500. Got a great deal on a 2012 Pop, wanted a 2012 Sport, ut they didnot have any left.I had the car for little over a month.It is fun to drive, with the 5 speed, I would not get the automatic if you are buying one with base engine.Tha gas mileage is good.I called l and got the complete Owners Manuels for the car.The car is smarter than I am...<G>At the end of this model year I might have to buy the Turbo Model...<G>"
"Great pony car  This car has been great to own. It gets great economy (25+ highway) which isn't why I bought it! Performance car with easy to add options (B&M shifter, programmable computer). The performance is there if you dare to drive it like it is meant to be driven. I have had no maintenance problems. And the car just looks great. It is a classic (outlasted the Camaro and Firebird) and the new '05 looks better."
"3,000 miles a month and I love it!  I have a long commute.  113 miles round trip.  My 500 Pop does what I need it to do.  Great gas mileage and no drama.  I’m getting 44 mpg in strict interstate driving!   "
"Stylish convertible with novel top  I bought this car used two years ago. It had about 15k miles on it but the price was GREAT. I guess that's a caution if you plan to buy a new Fiat, but I got virtually a new car for under  $11K. I thought I wanted a used Miata but when I test drove the Fiat I knew that was the one for me. Not as sporty a driving experience perhaps, but a helluva lot more fun. The top can be stopped at any stage of opening, but has 2 built-in detents in addition to fully open. 1st position is basically a sunroof, second is as open as you can get without affecting rearward visibility, fully down is the quietest but like an old VW bug the folded down top is in the way of rear vision. Not really an issue out on the road but not the best idea in a parking lot environment. Styling is charming, capturing the retro feel but also seeming practical and logical for modern driving. My city driving in Sport mode yields about 36MPG. Also note that the storage capacity is quite limited compared to the non-convertible which has a full hatch. The convertible has a small trunk lid not a hatch. So I don't think this could be a grownup's only vehicle, but it's a blast to drive and every time I look at it or meet one on the road I feel happy! Reliability has been excellent. Only trips to dealer are for recalls and to add a conventional spare tire. Service here at Hendrick Dodge in Cary, NC has been excellent.November 2017 Update: The car continues to be fun to drive and I have had no reliability issues whatsoever. I have yet to see another convertible I'd prefer.May 2018 Update: Changed the spark plugs at 30K miles. Still runs great and love the car."
FIAT 500C Lounge  Have been very impressed by this little car.  Purchased it new and now have over 60K miles on it.  Only things replaced are tires at 40K miles and general maintenance. (one computer reprogram done by the dealer at 10K miles)   Automatic transmission makes it easy to drive around town and although the performance is not blistering it is more than adequate for this type of car. Leather interior is holding up much better than my Maserati.   It's the perfect beach cruiser for Southern California and weekend getaway vehicle!
"I love my fiat  I bought my Fiat in January of 2014 and have put just over 22,000 miles on it.  I love the drop top which I can drop going up to 50 mph and my gas mileage is at 40.2-I drive 30% city and 70% road.  I live in the upper Great Lakes and this little bulldog is surprisingly good in snow, plus with heated seats I can drop my top and watch the snow fall inside my cabin!  After 28,000 miles, my Fiat has averaged 41.2 mpg.  Now it is October of 2016 and my odometer shows over 36000 miles on it and I still LOVE my Fiat.  No issues to report other than a ton of fun!Now it is October 2017 and I have racked up 51,000 miles on my Fiat-the love affair continues.  I have had only one repair on little cha cha cha and this is a new headlight switch installed.  The Fiat 500 thinks it is a big bad bold car stuck in a little car's body!Now it is April of 2018 and my Fiat is still running proud and loud! Do not underestimate this little car's ability in snow-as long as I am not ""pushing"" snow the traction and ability to get around the snowy Great Lakes is surprising plus I can fit my skis inside. I love this little car after 56,000 miles"
"Best of 20 new cars I've bought  It's like driving in a Grand Prix, just going to the store!   And I've owned Dodge Vipers, Corvettes, AC Cobras, Honda S2000's, Mazda Miatas, GM Kappa convertibles.   As they say, it's better to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slow.   And it's not slow round corners.   I have the optional forged wheels with summer tires.  Handling is unbelievable.  I can stay with anything on a country road.   Sound is unbelievable.  It comes from the factory with no muffler!   Visibility is great.    Sunroof is roomy and far enough forward that you can see the sky.   Plenty of power.   It goes 131 mph and I can substantiate that!   Roomy, huge storage with the rear seats folded down.  I have the optional leather interior and it rivals premium luxury cars.   Bright, airy, a really great place to spend time.   I've owned the car five years and had zero service issues.   Highly recommended.  Recently added K and N cold air intake, Madness 500 ECU module, and Magnaflow exhaust.   Probably added 40 hp.   It flies now."
"Best FUN subcompact money can buy!  If one of your priorities is a FUN car to drive back and forth to work, than this is the best car for your money hands down!  I have over 90k miles on my car now and the only repair has been normal ... oil replacements, tires, & brakes.  I even still have the original clutch.  The car has never left me stranded and still gets 38mpg.  Do yourself a favor and get the Abarth version though as it has much more power and really sounds great too."
"Great car with a catch..  I admit, I'm pretty blinded by how much I love my Abarth and it's a car that I would definitely recommend to anyone thinking about one. They're super fun to drive, full of character, have great aftermarket support and turn plenty of heads. Mine has 34k miles with a few engine modifications and has been dead reliable. It's a little short on space and has a lot of cheap plastic on the inside (as to be expected from a car with subcompact economy car bones) though this never bothered me as I understood what I was buying. The big catch is that these are not a spectacular deal brand new with the price tag, however the depreciation makes these a stellar bargain with clean, low mileage examples with leftover factory warranty selling sometimes $10k less than new. If this is a unit you plan on keeping for years to come, then go for it. If this is a car you plan turn around and sell a year after your purchase be ready to take a tremendous hit due to depreciation."
"Beware, Fiat is unreliable (2013 Fiat Abarth)  I drove this car for 2 years and there is a problem with the rear axle. it is impossible to align the rear tires and the rear tires need to be replaced frequently due to wear. i replaced the tires at 20K miles and at 32K miles in spite of rotating the wheels.Fiat provided shims to try to correct the problem but the problem got worse after the shims were installed. I started to have a problem with the shifting. It was a manual transmission and it became very hard to shift. i traded it for a 2015 mini cooper s and i just love the mini. it handles so much better than the fiat, it's much more stable. the Fiat swayed on uneven pavement. The acceleration on the Fiat is poor. the mini is so much more responsive and energetic. The Fiat mechanics were nice young guys but they seemed in way over their heads and clueless."
"Piece of crap car!  Horrible car!! DO NOT BUY!!i have 22K miles on it and my turbo stopped working, in addition both my windows motors broke.Worst car ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Terrific Car  I have held off on writing my review for a couple of years (so my car is actually a '13) in order to see how it fared over time. I don't think they have made many changes since them to the Abarth. I did not give it a poor rating on things like ride quality and storage simply because the car is great for what it is. The ride quality is very stiff due to the sport suspension, as is the steering. It's what I wanted and what I expected, so it has not disappointed me in these regards. It is also noisy due to the awesome exhaust (which one dealer told me is made by Ferrari).   My only ""poor"" rating is on the visibility. Even looking out the front you have to be vigilant. There just isn't a lot of clarity no matter how you slice it.  Two other things I do not like:  no Bluetooth connect from phone to audio (unless calling someone) so if you want to listen to Pandora, you have to have cords. This is probably not the case if you get the navigation package. The other thing I do not like: terrible turning radius! Crazy. Feels like driving a boat when trying for a tight turn. These things being said, I thought that when I bought this car I would get tired of it after two months. It's loud, fun, stiff, small, fast, manual. I got it on lease for three years, so it was a gamble. Well, I have not tired of it at all. It has been great. You will get close to 40 mpg on the highway, and I average about 30 in mixed city driving. Also, I fit a Laz-y-Boy in the back! (Only because you can separate the seat from the back  with a Laz-y-Boy.) This is not a super fast car, but it FEELS super fast and it is a blast to rocket around. I will say that the turbo lag is a bit much. I hear that it is not so obvious in the automatic transmission. Also, Fiat often offers some great deals. I got this as a lease so had to pay the list price. The same car was on sale for about $4,000 less when purchasing. So leasing may not be the most economical choice. I have noticed that a lot of American reviewers are pretty hard on Fiat. I don't know why. Consumer Reports rates them with awful reliability yet I have not had a single issue. I test drove the VW GTI, and that is a great car, but a whole different animal. The GTI is faster, way more refined in terms of ride quality, but the Abarth feels like it is made for rallycross and wants to chew something up. It is just bursting to go when you put it in sport mode.  You can only get a sense of the Abarth by driving it and really pushing the pedal. Again, I'm not sure why it doesn't get amazing reviews, but I am not a car expert.  One person described the driving experience as ""driving an angry hornet.""  That is right on.On the highway, it holds very firm. I have driven it fair distances and been very comfortable, but again, it is quite loud. I would seriously consider getting another Abarth when my lease is up in 2016, but the girlfriend is not in favor. She says it makes her dizzy and it is too loud for us to talk on a road trip. Also, the racing seats are not conducive to her reclining to take a snooze while I drive. So....a word to the wise. In a nutshell, if you test drive this car and finish by getting out and telling yourself you feel like you just got out of a cocktail shaker, this may not be the car for you. If, on the other hand, you get out and you find yourself eager for more, then you know you have found your next car. It will not disappoint."
"Rob's Mustang review  I purchased this car in 2000 brand new. It had only 2.5 mi. on it when I test drove it. I have had other Mustangs in the past and this one is much better driving in inclement weather than the rest. I also believe it is the best built of all the past Mustangs. Throttle response in this one even today after 50,000 miles is incredible. Transmission is still a sure hook and the car has never let me down when it comes time to start it. I have even driven it in eight inches of snow and it got me home driving eleven miles. No problems with this car at all."
"2013 Abarth manual  - highest fun/$  You have to try it.. you may love or hate it - but it really is a fun car for 'enthusiast' drivers. Great value, provided you don't pay the MSRP (I got mine (with 3 year tire insurance - which I already used once for a repair) for 19K US$ + tax with end of year discounts of 6K.)Was considering other small/light 'fun' cars such as the Mini/Mazda Mx5/BRZ-FRS, but for similar performance/features it would be 10K more, anyway, I just kind of fell in love with it after a test drive.With the 17-inch wheels and P-zero tires this light weight car feels fast and nimble, not always stable on the edge. Provided you keep it in the mid-rev range the torque is strong and turbo lag is not an issue. Update: now at 22,000 miles/3 years later.. still a lot a fun to commute with - still puts a smile on my face.. - added a GoPedal (major improvement to response/lag), Craven Speed Short shift kit (feels much better than stock shifter long throw), a Madness high-flow intake (actually made some difference to holding boost and also the turbo sound)...... tiring for long drives such as San Jose to LA - no telescoping steering/high seats..   still love this car.. concerned about the San Jose dealership closing..  so far it's been reliable (even though I drive like I stole it (when alone - when very little traffic/clear road ahead/back-roads)) - except some minor interior back-light issue on the air controls - fixed under warranty."
"Do NOT buy this Car!!!!  I have a 2013 Abarth.  I will start on a High note and say that it is a Blast to drive, sounds great, and is an amazing small performance car.  Now for the bad!  I bought mine used with 4100 miles on it for about $10000 less than a brand new one, $27,500 sticker price.  This should have been a sign that they don't hold their value at all.  I missed having a larger car and wanted to trade it in, they offered $14,000 trade in with 6000 miles on it.  Now with 16,700 miles on it I have had a brand new radiator put in it and have an appointment for a speedometer that stopped working today!  Do yourself a favor and by a Honda Civic Si,VW GTi or Ford ST! I wish I had taken my own Advise!"
"Great niche car...think before you buy  Up front I'll say that I love this car and it is great for my needs.  But this is absolutely a niche vehicle that is lots of fun as a run-about but gives up a lot in utility/flexibility.  There is no way I would have bought this as an only car in the household--something like a GTI would make way more sense or a Focus ST if you wanted more edginess.  That said, I felt the Abarth had way more character, was more fun, and was more unique for a hot hatch.  It feels a more raw and simple than the competition--which I like.  It gets me to work every day, puts a smile on my face when I drive it, gets good gas mileage, and for short trips fits a family of three and groceries for a couple of days."
"Fun unless you want something practical  Full disclosure: I bought this car on a whim. My car enthusiast friend fully endorsed my decision, touting it had the ""best stock exhaust ever"". It's fun to drive in the city, especially under the raised train tracks in Chicago - you can actually hear the car roar. Unfortunately it's so far from practical it's not even funny. Inevitably the fun runs out in a couple of months and you look up trade-in value to see that this car holds absolutely zero value. And good luck explaining to the car dealerships that your Abarth is in fact different than a standard 500. I really wanted to love this car... it just didn't happen. Oh, and I had SILLY repairs two months in."
"In love with my lil Veleno  I was considering a Mini or an MX5 around the time the Fiat came back to the US. I purchased a Fiat 500 Sport instead. It was not a complete dog like the regular mini cooper and I loved the extra space that the MX5 did not have. I can go to the grocery store in the Fiat! About 9 months ago I purchased an Abarth. Best idea I ever had. I have a 45 minute commute each way in traffic. The car zips in and out of traffic and I have had no mechanical problems. I have driven many of my friends Mini S, which cost a lot more (I paid $19,000 for new Abarth at year end clearance sale). Abarth drives so much better and the sound is spectacular. The sport button turns the car into a monster. :)"
"Fun little beasty  When Fiat left the US market oh so long ago, I was not happy.By that time I had owned a very used 128 wagon, a new X-1/9 and then a new 131 Brava.Each one a wonderful little car....as long as you loved sporting little Italian designed automobiles.I did, and I do, so I was thrilled when Fiat returned to our market.Then, when they tossed in the Abarth engineering along with a Turbo and strengthened trans, equal length half-shafts etc. I knew I was going to own a Fiat again.Hooray, because I own one now.This Abarth is truly a fun car to drive.Sure, it has quirks, but like Fiats of old, they are endearing to a ""Driver"". "
 AWESOME FUN MY LITTLE TIGER   Abarth is ultimately more fun than my old mustang or Z a little power house that doesn't shy away from a fight love the engine growl and the kick more room than you think awesome bang for the buck .Fun the most fun than any car I have ever own worth every penny a pleasure to drive.
"From Pop to this little monster  Why I like this car? because I'm a Scorpius, Why I get this car? because I'm a Scorpius, and why I keep this car? because it's a scorpion.Scorpius people always like choose something that others usually don't, many of my friends don't understand why I get a little car like this? but, why would I get a corolla? this little Abarth, it's small, it's easy topark in the city, it's mean, it's fun, it's fast, it growl like a super car(on the happy meal menu), it's full of excitement, it's characteristic. I enjoy driving it everyday without worry about finding parking space(I live in SF, you know what I mean if you've been here). The customer service is excellent in SF and San Jose dealer. "
"Buyer Beware: 2013 Fiat 500 Abarth first year  It stalls often and is disabled on the road. I calledFiat of Denver Service only to discover Fiat won't look at it for over a week, with no loaner cars. I was told only Fiat dealers will work on them now -- not other nearby Chrysler dealerships. It's not like there are any close to home. We had high hopes for Fiat but are sadly as disappointed. Too much fear, uncertainty and doubt to risk considering the brand again. So sadly we can no longer confidently refer or recommend a dangerous Fiat."
"If you're a real ""driver"" get one  As I said in the title, if you enjoy driving and take it seriously, get one. I was very pleased with my 500 Sport (35000 mi) but longed for a bit more 'oomph' to play with. It's handling and overall demeanor was really good and involving but getting up to speed was lacking. Enter the Abarth. As someone else stated in a previous review, the many changes made to the car to cope with the added power turned it into a different animal. The power is there, the steering more direct, the brakes (helped by the 17""tires) are like hitting a wall, the shifting is more direct and positive. Short of driving a race kart on the streets, this is 'it'. You just have to hear the engine fire up. Love it! "
"Rock on Ford!  If you are looking for a car with an affordable price tag, good fuel economy, and good looks, look no farther. This car is way better than a Focus or Escort for looks and style, way safer, has decent power (for a V6), and still gets 27 mpg. Sure it doesn't have the power of the awesome V8, but I wasn't looking for a racer,  I was looking for decent MPG and good looks; this car has both.  And it still has the great Mustang name.  Why buy a Taruas or Focus when this car is out there?"
Best car ever  I have before a 500 sport for 2 years and 3 weeks ago I trade it with 14k miles for the abarth 2013.Fun factor is there every day I drive it.Sales person at the fiat dealer in cary was the best.I was looking at the mini s and the new subaru Brz.The abarth is the best value for the money.
"From Pop to Abarth  My 2012 Pop was a wonderful car and I enjoyed getting into it every day but I knew in the back of my mind that an Abarth would eventually end up in my garage. I waited for the 2013 model to arrive and then I went for a test drive - don't do this unless you are ready to buy one. The Abarth is everything I liked about the Pop raised to the tenth power. Comparing the Abarth to the Pop is like comparing an Alpina to a base 3 series BMW - you know the cars are related,but so many components have been upgraded that it is a completely different car. If you appreciate what FIAT has accomplished with the 500 you are going to love the Abarth."
"Hardcore Hatchback!  Fiat was a sponsor of the US Grand Prix in Austin and had some Abarths on display. I really liked the look of the thing. Nice interior but not as quirky as a Mini Cooper.For such a tiny car it just looked mean. A week later I test drove one. I decided that buying the car just didn't make sense for me. A week later I bought one. Sense had nothing to do with it. This car is loud, raw and rides like an ox cart. It is also FUN! I traded in the best car I ever owned, a 2012 VW Jetta Sportwagen TDI, that averaged 40 mpg. The Abarth seats look great but hurt my back. The shifter is rubbery. It could use a sixth gear. It only holds 10 gallons of gas. Go drive one. You will either get it or not...."
"Awesome car that will surprise & make you smile!!!  I test drove many cars looking for a cost effective economical car that would be a fun everyday driver while still be great on gas.  I test drove a Mini Cooper S convertible for 7 days and found it to be a noisy cheap car that really felt like a poorly built cheap car (shame on you BMW).  I looked at the beetle (just ok), focus (awful style), fiesta (nothing more to say), and many more, but just could not find the fun factor I wanted.  Then I happened upon a Fiat Abarth 500C and thought that looked interesting.  I test drove it ... and wow ... it was incredible.  It was perfect!  It had the fun factor with the exhaust note, convertible, 5-speed, and the power is great.  It also gets great gas mileage, low insurance cost, can seat 4 (yes the back seats are small but work just fine), feels solid/stable, and best of all a low mileage used car can be found for under 19k ... and then I find that the warranty is 4 years/50k ... Bonus!  I have since put over 25000 trouble free miles on this car including a couple of long distance trips.  This car never fails to make me smile and always a willing partner to have some fun.  On top of that, I get many comments on how nice the car looks because it is a limited edition Abarth 500c.  For 2013 there were only 250 imported to the USA ... so it is extremely rare to even see another one.  LOVE my car!"
"2013 Abarth 500 C is a great fun car!  Some of these reviews are just ridiculous, complaining about about this that they should have seen during a test drive.  My car has 22k on it now and I have done nothing besides normal oil changes/maintenance.  The car is always ready to have fun and everyone loves the looks/sound!  Just completed a 1200 mile trip with wife and daughter (yes in rear seat) and it ran perfect at 85-90 mph the whole way!  I would have liked a sixth gear for lower RPMs at higher speeds because at 85mph you are running 3600 rpm.  And yes they loose their values quicker than most cars so buy a low milage used car and you will have a perfect car.Update: I sold the car about 6 months ago because I needed more room.  Yes I miss it but I needed more room.  I would buy another"
"Best Value Hybrid  Bought 2017 Optima Hybrid in November 17. It was the only Hybrid Optima on the lot out of dozens of gas ones. I had been comparing Accord, Camry, and Malibu Hybrids and read the Optima Hybrid got 46 mpg on the hwy. That was only 2 or 3 miles per gallon less than the best of them so I did some pricing. My choice was for the 26,800 premium with pretty standard features, good radio with Android Audio and SiriusXM, dual zone climate control, tilt, cruise control,pwr    windows and Door locks. At the time of purchase, there was a $5,000 rebate offered. I could not believe it. All this car for less than a Prius prime.  I have driven it to over 18k miles in 6 months after taking several trips and I really enjoy and appreciate this car. My first trip was from Phoenix to Vegas. Did it on one tank of gas. The car went 828 miles. Very impressive! Really like having a 6 speed transmission instead of a CVT. Driven properly there are days when it averages 60 to 61 mpg city hwy mix. It can go up to 80mph in electric mode. 10 year 100 k warranty and a 5star safety rating I think the value is unbeatable."
Great value and quite luxurious  You get a lot for your money and great performance. We feel like this Has been a great buy for us.
I love this car  This car is amazing and have no complaints. You get a lot of bang for your buck.
25miles per gallon hybrid  At 11k now in a lease for 39 months and it only gets 25mpg in city.  3 times dealerships say it just not broken in yet.  Do not buy!!! Very poor service follow up.  Filed case with corporate and still have yet to hear from them. Over a month now.
"Best PHEV  I've owned BMW, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz in the lasts 10 years and have been shopping around for a PHEV for months. I was considering and test driving the Ford Fusion Energi, Chevy Volt, Totoyta Prius, Nissan Leaf, BMW i3, Huyndai Sonota Hybrid, Tesla Model S but finally traded in my Mercedes for a KIA Optima EX PHEV for its styling, infotaiment system, technologies, range, price/value ratio, long warranty. This car met all my expectations: stylish, smooth/quiet/comfortable interior, reasonable EV range. It did deliver the 29 all EV range as advertised. I've installed a 240V outlet and used an inexpensive level 2 charger I bought from Amazon.com for less than $250, it charged the car from empty to full battery in less than 3 hours.  Well done KIA!"
"Great looking car  I purchased the Mustang new with every option you could get on the V6 Premium Cpe including ""Pony Package"".  It's the first American car I've bought in 20 years.  Great looking car with a very stiff ride and lots of rattles.  At 30k service, it needed an Alternator and a battery. All things considered, I like the car sans the rattles which the dealer has been unable to fix.  I have a 20 year old toyota with out any rattles!"
"Everything I dreamed it would be...  This car is amazing! There are only two things wrong with it. The trunk opening is TINY even though the trunk is really big. The other thing is that the front cup holder is dangerously close to second gear. Other than that this car is great. Interior/exterior styling is breathtaking. The throaty engine will throw your organs into the back seat if you floor it. Handles like a dream. Gas mileage is very acceptable; so far it's been better than my 2.0L Celica. The seats are comfortable; test drive a Celica if you want to feel pain. Anyway, we all know it's your dream to have one so stop punishing yourself and go buy it.  The price is low when it's used, so insurance is the only problem."
"Only thing good is warranty  Car does not get anywhere near advertised mileage, it varies depending on which gas station you use. but my V8 Mustang GT gets better mileage on the highway. The taillights fill with moisture all the time, had them replaced 8 times still do it. The trunk comes open when it wants, the bluetooth does not sync have the time. Worst of all is resell paid 36k after 10k miles it is worth $16,500 should have never switched from Toyota"
"Best Deal and pleasent suprize  Bought new and got an awesome deal, love the car more than I thought and so have the people who have ridden in it."
This thing has 4 wheels and an engine!  I don't think KIA knows what the term hybrid means!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can get a 6 cylinder Honda sedan that will give me the same mileage as this junk!  Passenger seat feels like your liteally sitting on the floor! you see jack from the seat!  The rear view from the drivers seat is a joke as well!
"Love the seats  I have sat in both the front and back seats and I there great. I have a bad neck and on long drives my neck never bothers me. This is coming from a man that traded in a Cadillac for the hybrid. The mileage is exactly what the review say, a bit lower than other of the same size, especially in colder weather. Overall though I am very happy with the car"
Seats are horrible & not comfortable  The back seats are so laid back you cannot straighten yourself up.  The passenger front seat is so low that you feel like you are sitting in a pod.  If someone is seated behind this seat you cannot move it back either.  So most time your knees are touching the glove compartment.  It is exceptionally good with gas. All other things are ok in this car.
"Kia Hybrid is poor man’s hybrid  Couple of things.. passenger seat is terribly low, radio has terrible sound, lighting is bad on instrument panel (red lights don’t show up well), seat track breaks every 20,000 miles. Mileage is effected by weather, lower mpg in cold weather. Hybrid gearing is dangerous. Starts with little hp In first gear. Slow to speed up."
Ex Hybrid FAIL!!!  3 times to the dealership with documented mileage.  No support or fix. I get 25mpg in city and about 33 on the hwy.  the hybrid doesn't work. It's running mostly off the engine. Dealerships excuses... it's just not broken in yet.  I now have 11k miles.   FAIL!!!  Do not by the hybrid.  My sisters non hybrid does just fine at 36/40 mpg
No so high-brid  25mpg in the city 33 hwy on the 2016 ex hybrid. Taken it in twice stating poor mpg and was told it's just not broken in yet. I have 10k on it when is it going to break in?  Liars!!
"A hybrid with good styling  If you are wanting a hybrid, but don't want the ugly as dog poop Prius, this is a car for you to check out."
"Love the 2016 Kia Optima Hybrid (even more than th  They changed the interior in the 2017. They did improve the comfort of the seats/headrest, but for me, they went backwards in terms of the interior styling- very bland and generic."
Not Too Shabby...  A LOT of noise in the rear differential.  Kind of unnerving.  Now having transmission troubles.  Soon to be replaced(again).  But performance is INCREDIBLE!
"Glad I only got the two year lease...  Maybe it's just my car - and I know it has JD Power initial quality award for the segment - but I'm having a few issues that started when I initially got the car.  The door rattles, the dashboard makes noises in the heat - occasionally the temperature gauge starts out showing an exterior temp of 32 degrees even when it's well over 70, and sometimes the rear camera stays on ten second past pushing the car out of reverse into drive.  The car handles ok, acceleration is poor though.  Excellent use of space and nice panoramic roof...  No SMS notifications in infotainment system which my last two cars had...  This is my first Kia, and I'm disappointed - it will be my last - like I said before I was debating between a 2 and 3 year lease - I'm glad I went with the two year."
"Catchy review  A really good car; had a 2017 Premium with luxury pkg.  Missed some of the good stuff and traded it for a Limited, same year, after a month.  Really enjoy the added toys.  Only been driving this one for a week, but think it is a great car and glad I made the latest move.  Hard to find but definitely worth the effort."
"Gotta Have A Cadenza!!!!!  As my lease on my 2015 Chevy Malibu was almost up, I started car shopping and I HATE car salesmen.  I looked at several cars including buying a Malibu, Sonata, Cadillac and more, and I had a salesmen suggest I drive a  new 2017 Cadenza, which I did.  I am glad that I listed to him.  I loved the ride, but I was not going to pay $46K for the top of the line model.  The lease deal they had seemed great, but at the end of the day, it was still way too expensive.  I knew I wanted a 2017 Limited and preferably white.  I found a 2017 used (8200 miles) exactly like I wanted and I saved almost $17k from what it would have cost new.  I LOVE THIS CAR.  The ride is great, the looks are great and where I was concerned about my gas mileage (the Malibu averaged about 26 mpg around town and I got 32 mpg on the highway), this Cadenza is right there even though it's rated for only 20-28.  I drive it like there is an egg under my accelerator and once I get it up to speed, I just hold the gas pedal in place, I don't have to keep feeding it like I did on my Malibu.  On a recent highway trip I averaged 37 MPG (YES 37 MPG) and I am getting about 26 mpg around town.  What more could a buyer ask for?   Great Deal!!  Great Looking car!!!   Great MPG!!!  If you are looking for a nice upscale luxury type sedan, you need to look at the Cadenza.  I would highly suggest trying to find a used one and save yourself mega $$$$$."
"Buy one  I've owned 3 lexus suv's and 1 sedan. The kia cadenza is very equal if not better then lexus. I'm very impressed with kia. Style, luxury, handling,pricing. Couldn't be more happier with my decision. As the old saying goes. Try it you may like it. Vinnie. New Jersey."
"This 2017 Cadenza Limited is amazing!  Drive the limited trim first.  Get to know the outstanding array of safety, comfort, and convenience features.   And, by all means, spend some time with the Harmon Kardon audio system."
review  nice car  better than expected  gas mileage    great service
"2 for 2  I leased a 2015 cadenza, for 2 years after leasing a infinity. The cadenza was a better all around vehicle. I now lease a 2017 cadenza and l love the new style,I have not had a single problem with either car.Plush interior and great performance!"
Great large car  This is a great car at a good price. Can't beat 0% financing.
Big Car Great Value  Bigger than BMW 3 or 5 Series. More Comfortable than Mercedes. Better warranty than everyone. What a value!
"Surprisingly Great Tech Package update  I have owned BMW Convertible, 5 Series M Sport, Acura TSX & many Toyota's & Honda's. The 2017 Cadenza is the most comfortable car I have ever owned. Full of High Tech in Tech package. Smooth ride, excellent seats (better than Volvo).August 2018 updateTo date this is the best car I have ever owned.  No repairs in 1st year and 21,000 miles. No adjustments of any sort. By comparison my BMW’s needed 3-6 in first year. Tread life on tires is good but tires are too noisy once broken in. Seats are superbly comfortable. Averaging 27 MPG with 50/50 split on highway vs city driving. List price for my car was just under $40000, got it out the door for under $33000. What a great car & what a bargain. Have only less than 10 of them on the road in last year. Nice!"
Dependable racer  I have had my car for 3 years now and I 
"Surprisingly a nice car  I traded in a 2014 Chrysler 300 and purchased the 2015 premium with the technology and luxury packages with 15k miles.  I was looking at the Buick LaCrosse, Chevy Impala, Azara.  The car is just as roomy as the 300 and surprisingly drives much better.  The car with the 19 inch tires is very stiff, and you can feel the bumps as you drive.  The car is very comfortable to drive, i especially enjoy the option of the extended seat for the back of the legs on long trips.  i didnt think much about that until i used it and it was very comfortable.   As simple as this may be, the headlights on the car are very good, and you can see a good distance with them.  I find that the navigation and UVO system is very finicky and i am having trouble with the voice recognition (how does call home turn into call Paul?), maybe i just do not know how to use it yet, but i would think it would be self explanatory.   The car has very good acceleration for the V6, especially when you are at highway speeds.  I have the paddle shifters, but havent used them nor am i sure why they would be on this car, i cant see too many buyers of this car using them.  I am currently getting 25.5 mpg in normal mix driving of highway and city, so that was a surprise to me, was expecting less.                                                                            Overall the car is very good very comfortable, good gas mileage and very roomy.  all the controls are in easy to reach places and are easy to use. The ride is stiff on the 19 inches, but the handling is very good as well; not a sports car handling but very good.   there are a few things that are annoying 1) how does a car like this not come standard with a remote start 2) the universal remote buttons on the review mirror do not light up when the headlights are on 3) the car is lower to the ground than i expected vs some of the competition 4) this car with the 19 inch low profile wheels are HORRIBLE in the snow, you will need snow tires.  I would recommend this car"
"Nice, BUT...  Car has power and is extremely quiet, however, transmission is not smooth, nav/electronics not very intuitive and set up of front seats for comfort is poor for long trips.  The AC is nice and operates well.  Also, backseat is roomy.  The absolute WORST part of owning this car vs every other car I've bought/leased is the dealerships.  I had problems with the two I dealt with on several levels.  Overall, performance is great, comfort is poor and would like easier-to-use electronics."
"Decent but Disappointing  The car itself is really good mechanically but i have to agree with a previous reviewer who noted that the navigation system is horrible.  Acceleration is consistent with other cars in the category.  Handling is just ok, certainly not up to Audi A4 standards.   Interior is great, the roof is great.  I've had some problems with Kia Finance as well and recommend avoiding them, if possible."
"You don't drive a Cadenza? Shame on you!  Just purchased my 2nd Cadenza Limited. This is my 7th Kia since 2001. This is the perfect car for price, warranty,  options. You will pay a great deal more for same options on BMW, Lexus. Mercedes-Benz. Don't waste your money for the name and prestige of such. Test drive this car. You will purchase. Get the SX Limited. Excellent road car. Burn only premium fuel and you will get 30+ mpg on road trips. Over 500 miles on one tank of gas. Check out the 2017 Limited. Many added features and actually a slightly lower price. You just will not go wrong with any Kia but particularly with the Cadenza Limited. Test to drive it, you will buy it."
Saved our lives!  I loved my car & it saved my daughter and myself lives when we were Tboned at 60mph- we had minor injuries the curtain side airbags protected my daughter the car held up to such a hard impact I'm impressed- I will be replacing it with a 2016 Cadenza- so grateful for all its safety features and I will miss my black on black- great car!! And worth every dollar
BEST AND SHARPEST CAR ON THE ROAD  YOU CAN NOT BEAT THE PRICE AND WARRANTY FOR WHAT YOU GET!!!
"Is it really a KIA?  I test drove the Cadillac CTS, the Lexus ES 350 and the Cadenza.  Absolutely love my Cadenza.  I've owned many new higher end GM and Toyota cars but have never enjoyed driving one as much as my Cadenza.  Apparently I'm not alone with my feelings as I am seeing more and more KIAs on the road.It is now 9 months later and I still love my Cadenza.My only additional comment about my Cadenza is that with the 19 wheels and a somewhat taut suspension, I feel that 18 inch wheels or higher profile tires would have been a better choice for more comfortable driving over some of the New England roads that are in disrepair."
"Mostly Good  I have about 2K miles on a 2015.   The Car looks nice, drives well and has good acceleration.   Pricing was good.   However buyers should know a couple of things:1.  These cars depreciate  pretty quickly.   Do you own comparison.  Suggest a lease2.   The handling is comfortable but not sportyMy one disappointment has been the built in GPS  which simply consistently make VERY strange routing systems.   The system allows you to pre-program selections such as ""avoid tolls""  but it has just been horrible.   I am disappointed that i use Google on my smart phone for navigation although its not a huge deal.   Positives are the roof (cool), the look (nice...looks a lot like a Lexus) ,   the acceleration is good,  comfort is good. Very spacious."
"My Cadenza - a symphony of motion  Drive it.  Then drive an Avalon, a Regal, a Maxima, a Chrysler 300 and an Accord.  The Kia Cadenza is the best ride - quiet, smooth, powerful and comfortable.  The price is competitive too."
"A great car and value  I purchased a Factory Certified 2015 Cadenza Limited.  So far I have really enjoyed the car and received many compliments on it.  I would say my only slightly negative comment is that I was surprised that the car does not have daytime running lights.  I didnt even think to ask because they are so prevalent on cars and most all other Kia's seem to have them. Otherwise, I would certainly recommend this car to anyone especially as a used purchase as they are a great value."

"kia Has Hit it on the Head!  This is our third Kia, Have Had the 2013 Kia Optima and 2014 Kia Forte. Next Step Was Up to The 2015 Kia Cadenza.So Far We Are Loving It. This Car Is Awesome………….Lets Go For a Ride!"
Less than expected  The voice recognition system is really bad. My wife and I both have no accent whatsoever and it can't recognize a single name we ask it to call. Also the voice commands for music is very limited. It will not let you say paly a single artist or song (just shuffles your library.
"No comparison!  I love cars. I love cars that are considered underdogs. I love cars that you don't see everyone driving. I love knowing that I have made a great deal and my car is worth every penny I spent. The cadenza is just that. An underdog that is better than its competition. No comparison. The impala, 300, Taurus etc. I owned two of the three competitors. Not that they are bad cars or alternatives. They just are not the best.  I drove the Toyota Avalon, bmw, Acura, and Lexus. For the price range the cadenza blows them away. Not to mention the styling and standard features! Kia comes with the 5 year warranty and 10 year powertrain and a specific premium service for it cadenza owners. I love that there isn't one every time I turn the corner. As a matter of fact KIA should be paying me to advertise. Lol. Every where I go people are always wondering what the car is and when I tell them a KiA they are instantly intrigued and ask me questions. its a beautiful car, quiet, handling, safety, and standard luxury features. Kia is in the rise and its quality is great. No recalls.  No repairs. No issues!! I haughty recommend.  They have hit this one out of the park. From what I hear from other Kia owners, it is the norm to have high quality and no recalls. They have made it into the luxury market and are moving forward quickly. I hear the K900 is also beautiful and hard to compete with, you won't be disappointed. Give Kia a try. You'll be impressed to say the least. Trust me."
"Average Joe  I traded my BMW for the all new 2015 Kia Cadenza.  I did not make a mistake. This is car continues to impress me and my friends. Roomy, quite, smooth ride, and  lots of luxury amenities that comes standard at half the price of BMW and Mercedes. Kia has step up to the plate with this car."
Better than BMW and Mercedes  Superb handling in a Beautiful Package.  Road Handling is a little stiff which reminds me of premium european sedans.  We now have 15K miles on our 2015 Cadenza and have no serious complaints and nothing has broken.  Additional sound attenuation would be appreciated but the noise level is better than most comparable vehicles.All in all Kia has hit it out of the ballpark with the Cadenza.  This may be the reason that virtually no dealer has any 2015 models remaining unsold.
"Cadenza Premium  I purchased my Cadenza Sept 2014. Overall, I'm very happy with my selection. I was certainly torn between choosing the Cadenza over the Chevy Impala. They were identical in terms of what I wanted in a fully loaded full size sedan, however the Cadenza had just more of that ""it"" factor I was looking for. There is no way possible I could get this much standard luxury at the price I paid in a BMW, Lexus, Mercedes, Audi, etc. "
My Dream Car!  Don’t sleep on Kia’s
"Beware beware beware!!!!!  This car is one of the nicest cars I have ever owned.  Spacious, hugs the road.....until....I was driving down the street and started to hear a loud clicking noise.  Towed it to the dealer and was told that the car needed a new engine!  I bought the car with 37k miles and the car was under 60k miles when this happened.  I had two oil changes on the car and was very careful with it.  THE KIA WARRANTY IS COMPLETELY HORSE****!  They will not honor it....but will come up with ways, at the cost of the owner, to suggest things that need to be done for the car....all so they can say it was your fault.  I will NEVER buy a KIA again just by the way they do business.  This was my only car and the financial setback to me was MAJOR!  NEVER AGAIN!"
"Very disappointed  Purchased new in 2014 car has 49,000 miles on it now has been in shop 3 times so far 1st time car had rough idle at start up shaking for about 15sec replaced timing stuff had car for weeks had to order parts about a month ago check engine light come on catalytic converter problem fixed it last week check engine light again took in today now saying the other catalytic converter...I will never buy another Kia and this was my 2nd purchase"
"Love this car  I was shopping for a Mercedes, or other top line car, and had never really considered a Kia.  I have been a loyal Toyota fan, and have owned multiple Avalons, but the current design of the Toyota models did not appeal to me.  This car had all the same features that other luxury models for less than half the price (I bought this car used).  With only 12K miles, it was as good as new, and I got a great bang for my buck, even though I paid additional for a long extended warranty.  I have owned the car for almost 9 months, and have no real complaints.  The one complaint I have is with the ventilated driver's seat, which on very hot days did not really cool.  Overall I am glad that I made this purchase."

"Good value but in the shop a lot  It's a great value however before my car even had 55,000 miles on the odometer I had the fuel sending unit and oxygen sensor replaced. The rack and pinion also failed all repaired under warranty. I wasn't expecting all these things with such low mileage. The car has never stopped running at all despite the problems. I had one issue where the entire car just died and needed a jump. The car turns head everywhere I go. I love the look and functions of the car. I think you'll love the car as if repairs do arise they are a lot cheaper than the other luxury brands. The car is excellent on the highway and very comfortable on long trips. I've enjoyed this car despite the few issues and I think you would too."
Niiiiice ride  Really surprised at the look and feel of this little  known of vehicle.
"Big Bob's Cadenza Review  I have owned or leased 5 Kias!  This includes an Amonte, three ( 3 ) Optimas, and the Cadenza I am reviewing.  The 2014 Cadenza I just traded in was one of the finest cars I have ever owned.  I never had one bit of trouble with it and it ran like a dream.  My ONLY criticism was getting in and out of the vehicle.  Because the car was low to the ground and I have a back that gives me trouble on occasion, it was a little bit of an effort to get in and out.  Once seated, I had no problems.  I would highly recommend this vehicle to ANYONE, and that includes luxury car owners.  I can make that statement, because I have owned Cadillacs, Lincolns and other high end vehicles.  My advice is simply this, if you can afford a Cadenza, buy it and you will not be disappointed."
"Pleasantly Surprised.  A nice KIA?  That is an oxymoron, right?  I test drove a Cadenza on a recommendation and was shocked.  I bought one a week later.  It reminds me of an Audi A6; big, comfortable, and lots of power.I have now owned it for two years. Has about 50k miles.  It still drives great."
Luxury at a bargain price  Great vehicle!  Make a deal and drive away!
Perhaps too much  The dashboard seemed to contain too many things and appeared to be too close to the driver
"What a Deal  Got the car as a dealer demo model with 15K miles.  I have put over 20k new miles on in 8 months.  My average mileage, city and road, is about 26mpg,  Love all the amenities and features.  The entertainment/info capability is great and works very well.  Easy Bluetooth connection. I did update the nav map info (about $180) that I thought was high.   Not thrilled with mileage of original Hankook tires.  I have to drive all over Colorado, so mountains and plains.  Got some Pirelli Sottozero 3 winter tires and they really allowed great traction even in blizzard conditions.  The bang for the buck is great, particularly as I got the car ""used.""   All who have ridden in it love the features.  Heated steering wheel has to be the favorite.  Paddle shifters for the mountains, with adaptive headlights really helps.  There aren't many out there, but it's absolutely a car to consider, if you need or want a more full sized sedan.  The value over euro sedans is tremendous.  Learn to love the name Kia."
"26,000 miles  Still enjoying the ride.Dread eventually having to replace expensive 19"" tires.When I'm using the wipers, I wish they would automatically sweep once each time I step off the brakes (like in my former '01 Acura TL).Trunk door collects rainwater which drips into cargo compartment when opened.Badly obstructed side-view vision."
Celina Cadenza  This is a great car. I traded in my 2014 for a 2015. This new one had a few more features that I really liked and had to have.
"Complete Car for the Majority of People-UPDATE  UPDATE:  Bought the 2016 and couldn't be happier. Much nicer than the 14, Insurance rates dropped due to the additional safety equipment .You should shop and drive all the vehicles you have an interest in, investigate the cost of ownership, and the intangible pleasure factor of driving the car in as many situations as possible. Then and only then should the hesitant people should drive the Cadenza, with the comparative of your chosen vehicles, make an informed decision especially when you look at the cost to operate and buy plus the warranty. The answer is so apparent that Kia Cadenza is the right choice if those guidelines are important to you.I have never had anyone in my car that wasn't impressed and some ultimately bought a Cadenza. the ONLY issue I have had with my car is that upon starting after sitting for a short while, I get timing chain noise on startup. I have talked with other owners that do not have this issue and Kia is doing everything to fix the problem. When the 2016 Cadenza comes out I will most likely buy it, provided I can turn loose of my 14.UPDATE: Bought my 2016 Cadenza! Better actual gas mileage than my 2014 Cadenza with more safety features. Again totally happy with this car."

"The moron who left Toyota for the 2014 Cadenza  Don't get me wrong. I love the HD radio, the heated steering wheel along with the ride & handling. But so many little things have broken or gone wrong--the backup camera, the panoramic sunroof rattling which took 4 tries to fix, the volume control on the steering wheel broke, the sun visor tore, the seat belt stopped retracting, and the bluetooth is frustrating. I leased it thankfully because the value has crashed so to get out with 15 months to go would cost thousands out of pocket. If you love what you are driving don't experiment. Stick with the brand you know. I am now waiting for parts while driving a dodge loaner. It's nauseating. This wasn't the plan. The dealer tries it's best.

"terrible road noise  I own a 6 year old Kia Amanti and a new Kia Cadenza with the optional Luxury Package. I have enjoyed driving my Amanti long distances. It is quiet and a pleasure to drive. The Cadenza is Kias new luxury car since the Amanti was discontinued. Instead of a quiet ride, the Cadenza has horrible road noise. It sounds as if a window is always partly opened. I called Kia Customer Service (Kelly) to complain that a car branded as a luxury car should be first and foremost a quiet ride. I was told that essentially the car is the way it is supposed to be, that the road noise is my opinion and have a nice day. "
Almost one year with Cadenza  Some problems started early on and some continue.

"I love My Mustang  I love my Mustang. I bought it used and
have had it for a year and a half now.
The only problem I have had is the
driver side door lock broke, but it was
only a switch so it was an easy fix. It
goes pretty good for a v6 and it shifts
great! I would definately recommend this
car. I love the power, control and
awesome feeling i get from driving this
car.The trunk is a perfect size and I
don't care that the back seat is small,
I will never have kids so it doesn't
matter. This Mustang is definately a
great car."
"Enjoying my Cadenza Premium  Just purchased my new 2014 Cadenza. Love the room, features and pricing that under cuts the German competition by $10-15K. get the two thumbs up from strangers when driving.  Kia has really stepped ups game to go after the large car segment and with hiring the ex-Audi designer, the car looks stunning.  If the prestige brand is not a top priority (and this will save tonnes in service cost) Kia (and brother company Hyundai) if the way to go.
 Great work and looking forward to many years of use.  Will update in 6 months time."
"four months in  I traded in a 3 series BMW for my 2014 Kia Cadenza Premium model.  This has a much better ride, but is slower off the starting line.  The front wheel drive 3.3 liter V6 produces 298 horsepower and 255 ft-lbs of torque.  Doesn't belong on a race track, but fine for city driving.The ride in comfortable with above average seating front and rear.Exterior styling pretty generic."
"So Far I like it!  UPDATE 5/19/2017I still have the car but my wife drives it now the vehicle has about 85K on it (my wife drives for a living). We've had no issues w/the car except a regular maintenance. It does have one small and obscure rattle in the cabin that I can't pin point but I am confident is something of my wife's since she has a mobile office in there. All the electronics still work and we're both thankful for the cooled driver seat. I recently did a KBB on the value of the car and I was floor at how poorly is held its value. 3 year old car with high mileage will only snag me 11K!? My 2 year old ram 1500 held better value than that so that is really the only major complaint I have. I still think if you can pick up a used one coming off a lease for 20K or so it'd be a good deal for what you get. The V6 is still smooth as ever and the car is still fun to drive.I took on a new job that required a lot of travel. I had to get rid of my beloved pickup and downgraded to a Prius. I absolutely hated the prius. Granted it gets great gas mileage but the ride and everything about the car was not comfortable for me. I started researching luxury cars and decided between the Kia Cadenza and the Buick Lacrosse. I really felt the buick was a more comfortable ride, the seats were softer but that is pretty much where the pro's for that car stopped. I settled into the Kia Cadenza Premium w/the luxury package for $27K. I am glad I did as I took a 500 mile trip and really fell in love with that car."
"So far so good  I purchased the 2014 Cadenza in late June and immediately took a 2,500 road trip to California. The Cadenza is a very well behaved sedan that will turn heads and compete with the so-called big boys. I averaged over 30MPG for the trip and power was more than sufficient for my liking. The seats were extremely comfortable and I loved the seat coolers on both front seats, especially as we ventured into the 100+ degree Central Valley. I previously drove a 2002 Audi A6 and was tempted to go that route again, but for $20,000 less, I get fantastic mileage, same creature comfort, a beautifully designed exterior and easy to use electronics. I'll be interested to see how it holds up in the coming years"
"Great value, but not quite there as a premium car  Overall, this is a great vehicle, especially with a lot of them still on lots. It's not a rocket but it's fast enough, especially when passing. It's quiet with just a hint of wind noise. I do about 70/30 highway driving and don't go crazy on the gas and still get 27 mpg combined. Most significant disappointment is the stereo/nav system. While the stereo sounds good, it won't blow out any windows. The navigation system needs an overhaul. Directions can be pathetic at times and add unbelievable routes. Maps lose almost all detail after the 700-feet setting and I've had major highway ramps disappear at some resolutions. A great car but still just a pricier Accord or Camry."
"Some disappointments   The car is unsatisfactory 1) as it does not give the estimated mileage that was advertised on the window sticker and 2) the engine does not have sufficient pickup.3) The navigation on the car has been giving erroneous directions over the last several months.I took the car to Braman Kia for service. The service advisor is not knowledgeable nor competent. I had taken the car to resolve this problem and for a maintenance (oil change). I asked him if he could take care of both while I went to lunch and come back a few hours later. After I did, neither had been done on the car. The Kia service person did not know how to solve the navigation problem even after I explained how to.4) update 6/24/16. Overall reliable car. Has lot of options. It is good value. Three main disappoints were 1. Lack of pickup. Needed a more powerful engine 2. Navigation took me to wrong places several times. 3. Fuel economy was not what was stated on window sticker."
"Cadenza-Simply a beautiful car  KIA of Somersworth is a great local dealership. Brian the Sales MGR does a great job without the heavy sales pitch.I've been looking to trade in my 2013 KIA Optima SX for the new KIA Cadenza. Took the Cadenza for a test drive , the first thing that comes to mind is "" what a beautiful car"" Through out my initial drive of the Cadenza you just keep saying this is incredible. The interior is nicely appointed with high grade materials. There is a lot of attention to details right down to the stitching of the leather seats. The instruments are easy to use. The Cadenza Premium with a MSRP of 35k comes with a lot of nice features from Navigation heated seats,293HP V6, 18 inch chrome rims,infinity "
"45000 Mile Reflections  I've had to lower my rating for two reasons:Not long after posting my 31K review, I started having fuel injector problems. I had to return to the dealership FIVE TIMES for service, often after the engine light would come on during a period of sluggish acceleration and very low idling. It happened again on a 600-mile road trip less than two weeks after one of the ""fixes.""One of the injectors was replaced (at no cost), but the problem persisted. Finally, about two months ago the dealer persuaded me to spend $300 to have the fuel system cleaned out. That seemingly fixed the problem - until I was driving last week and the problem returned. The engine light didn't come on but acceleration was sluggish. Of course, I was on the freeway 150 miles from home when it happened. Fortunately, once I restarted the engine after stopping for a Five Guys hamburger, the problem went away.  I only burn ""Top Tier"" gas and have a CASE of Techron in my trunk; I add it to the fuel tank every 1K+ miles. Still, I have little confidence that I might not once again have this problem.Also, since my last review, I've had to spend nearly $200 at the dealership to have the rubber/plastic front bumper undercarriage repaired after it was almost torn off by getting hung up on a concrete parking lot barrier.  In Kia's quest to lower overall mileage, it reduces wind drag on the car by lowering the front end. But it's too low, making it vulnerable to frequent scrapes with parking lot barriers and steep driveway gutter interfaces.  I still enjoy playing my 6,000+ mp3 music selections on shuffle off a thumb drive in the UBS port (I can even include album art)!Would still prefer another couple of inches of driver headroom.Tight suspension is too hard for my liking.Creaking noise in the front quarter-panel on rough roads.Trunk lip leaks rainwater into the trunk. Unlike with my beloved 2001 Acura TL, when the wipers are on auto-wipe, they do not automatically wipe once whenever I remove my foot from the brake pedal after a stop. I miss that feature."
"28k Miles so far and........................  Cannot find one issue and I'm a German car fanatic. This vehicle is perfect in every way from brakes, power, quietness, to build quality. Even KIA corporate has contacted me for my opinion.This is a whole new game.Its a no brainier and one of the few buying decisions I've made that I can say I made a great decision.I own the car and I'm very direct in my thoughts. "
"2014 Cadenza  I just leased a new 2014 Cadenza with the Premium and Tech package. I choose the black exterior with white nappa leather.I then -after market had my windows tinted. I put $ 4300 down and did a 36 month,12,000 annual mileage lease. My monthly payment $ 299. I have approx. 1300 miles on the car and have enjoyed every second behind the wheel. Previously,I have driven lexus,Infiniti,BMW,etc and this beats them all. The features that are on the Cadenza would cost a minimum of $ 10-15,000 more on other vehicles. This vehicle is extremely well appointed and handles beautifully. A very happp customer and driver !"
"wonderful car  this has been a great car thus far.  no 
problems.  it is a blast to be able to 
drop the hammer at crusing speed when 
some slow putz in front of you can't 
seem to get out of 2nd gear on the 
hiway.  and they know you are 
unimpressed with their driving when 
they hear the uproarious thunder of the 
4.6L v-8 as you stretch the 260 horses 
for all they're worth.  or course, with 
the current gas prices, and my 
predilection for lead-footedness, it 
has been an expensive love affair.  i 
average, with my driving an hour the 
work on mostly hiways, 17mpg.  i have 
squeezed 27 mpg, but i don't like 
squeezing.        "
"Keep it up Kia  I had an optima which I really liked. Great car and gas mileage with many options. I was impressed with the craftsmanship of that car. When I took it in for service and I saw the new Cadenza I had to drive it. Well nit only did I test drive it I drove it home. I have 10,000 miles on this car already and enjoy this car more everyday. I get about 21.5 on a average for gas mileage which I don't think is bad for such a large car. Around 24-25 MPG on long trips."
"From Cadillac to KIA (WHAT?)  My last four cars were (I lease) a Lincoln Continental, Lincoln MKX, and 2 Cadillac CTSs.I switched a KIA Cadenza. Im not quite sure why. Price was not the issue. I really liked the car. Both the reviews and my impression of the car from a visual perspective made me lean towards making a change to a KIA. Frankly, Im a bit of a snob and dropping down in class caused me some concern. But once I got over the status hump and took a chance on this car I have been very much pleased.This car offers everything and more. It may be a little early. But too date, Ive found it to be a great car and not really a drop in class just name. I might feel a little hurt by not having the Cadillac name "
"My new favorite brand!!!  Just purchased a 2014 Kia Cadenza with Luxury Package and not looking back. A great all around car with a sport/luxury persona. The handling and engine response satisfies my joy of driving. The look, comfort and size makes it a very solid The interior is smooth and practical. Its old school with a modern touch. The navigation, voice command and bluetooth is key and learning(or reading the manual) is a breeze. Trunk space is awesome. I don't miss GM. I welcome my new car plus 3 year full maintenance plan! My experience with Hyundai and KIA have been through family and friends. As years pass, quality and convenience has become their calling card. I am glad I answered. "
"Korean Cadillac?   I'm leasing a fully loaded Smokey Blue Cadenza with the Premium, Technology and the white Napa leather packages.I have gotten lots of compliments.The car is very good looking.I've had the car for 2 months, 2,300 miles now and am quite impressed with it.The fit and finish, the quiet and smoothness of the engine and the ride is comparable to the luxury nameplates that cost several thousand dollars more.The technology features are great and for $42K sticker it has every bell and whistle you can think of.If you are tired of paying big bucks for a prestigious hood ornament and want understated elegance and value, do yourself a favor and give this car a look!!After my 3 year lease was over, I sadly turned the Cadenza into the dealership.  Overall it was a fantastic car and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a large comfortable sedan.  I miss all of the technology features and the quiet and comfort it provided.  The fuel economy was quite impressive for a car of its size with the 3.3 L V6 engine.    Buying a used one now is the best bet.  For a price point in the low $20K range you can drive in style and have all of the latest tech gadgets.  I really wish Kia would add an AWD option to the sedans in their line up. Living in the northeast in hilly areas requires AWD."
"Cadenza review brief update   I returned the car a few months ago.  I think if you like a certain brand stick with it. This was a cool car but it was not what I would call a luxury experience.  There were several things that came up during the lease and down time with rattles and other replacements like the driver's seat belt, steering wheel electronics and back up camera turned into weeks in the shop.  The I Agree on the nav screen every time starting out turned into over 5,000 I agrees over the life of the lease.  It was almost perfect at lease turn in but it wasn't inspected for two weeks and there were several charges that took some major effort with the selling dealer and the factory to waive.  The factory was immovable on this, so my only conclusion is they must have a lot of deadbeat customers or something wrecking their leased cars. But i did like it so asked if I could lease another for two years.  However since it depreciated like a boat anchor, even the selling dealer had nothing to offer in terms of worthwhile incentives for a new one.  They had no choice but to send it to the auction because there was no equity in keeping it or buying out the lease.  So in conclusion they had a chance at keeping a customer relationship but lost it after just one lease experience."
"2014 Cadenza w/Technology Package   It has been about three weeks and 1000 miles since I leased this new Cadenza.If someone would have told me 6 months ago I would be driving a Kia, I would have told them they were crazy.But I read about it in some comparison tests and was driving past the dealer, so I randomly stopped to take a look. I was impressed with the aggressive style, and the smoky blue metallic had me hooked.They pulled it right out of the showroom and off we went for a test drive.As a very loyal Toyota and Lexus owner for over 20 years, and the lack of aggressiveness (especially Lexus on the ES) to make a deal pushed me over the line and away I went in the new Cadenza."
"My first 1200 miles...  This past weekend I took my first road trip (800mi rnd trip); I was more than thrilled with how it handled. ItÂs seriously autobahn ready! The Cadenza was solid at all speeds 70, 80, 90+. No matter the speed, it continued to accelerate with very little prodding; and the steering remained precise/accurate. MPG: On the 1st leg I avgÂd 28.7mpg, on the 2nd I averaged 28mpg; I was NOT driving economically. :) In the city, I have averaged 22mpg so far.The features and appointments crammed into this car are ridiculous! To get the same size of car, with the same features, I would have to spend at least $15K more. In short, there are no dancing rats anywhere near this car; it is a joy to drive!"
"KIA Cadenza Sucks  KIA will screw you,when they get the chance. I bought a brand new 2016 Cadenza loaded,worst car,worst service,worst experience with a new car period.....Long story short,my car was in the shop 4 different times for the same problem over a period of just after purchase to a yr and a half. They finally kept it for 3mos and had to supposedly put a new engine in it. Little did I know they put a 2014 remanufactured engine in my 2016,,and then the same thing happens to it again. The escalation dept basically told me oh well cant ant wont do anything. I had an attorney look at it and because I signed a deal thinking my car had been repaired properly with a new engine,there is nothing that could be done any further. The dealership I bought it at wouldnt even take it in trade for a new one because they knew the history,and told me to my face they wouldnt take it and why.So now Im stuck with a car I cant drive and still owe alot on and have to have a new car for work because I commute over a 100 mi rd trip daily. So you can see why I need a reliable vehicle. This car had left me stranded 5 times the first time was three days after buying it!! So Im done with KIA!!  I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THEM FOR ANYTHING NOR THE DEALERSHIPS IN LONGVIEW,TYLER,ROCKWALL TX!!!"
Amanti Believer 6 +  Cadenza Follower  Absolutely loved the Kia Amanti drove for 6+ years..Bought 2016 Kia Cadenza...A great ride with important safety items in base price...Lane departure / cross traffic signal / large area viewing backup camera etc.....Other sedans you pay  for add on safety...
From 2013 Tahoe to 2016 Kia Cadenza  Great upscale looking and feeling car for less than 2/3 of what I was paying for the Tahoe. Great move for me as I prep for retirement.
"Built Ford Tough  A month after I bought this car I 
already had to take it to Ford 
dealership b/c the transmission didn't 
sound right, and of course they made up 
some excuse why they couldn't work on 
it even though it was on the warranty. 
Every time I'm at a stop light if the 
air conditioner is on the whole car 
shakes. My cd player now doesn't work 
and it's almost impossible to get out. 
And why would anybody put the 
cupholders right behind the shifter? It 
is now starting to overheat in the 
summer.The bad overpowers the good. As 
soon as I get a chance I am trading it 
in."
Anti  theft  System  What does Car 5 months ago  Haven't had any issues with it all of a sudden it doesn't wanna star it won't crank over all the lights come on and it's the anti theft system   Call the dealership and all they do is give you the run around I'm sure they know what the problem is now but all they wanna do is get me in there because according to them it could be 5 to 7 different things  Losing my faith in kia  I have a 04 kia Sedona
"Family in action  Faithful to its duty. Its a KIA. If you wanted a sports car, you wouldn't be reading this."
"It wouldn't die!  Living in Canada, our winters are hard on cars. This van would not die! I bought this van with 250,000km on it and I ran it until 450,000km it was still running strong but I hit a moose going 110km an hour and it destroyed the van. Every year we would haul a 4500pound trailer all the way aroundOntario and it never really hurt the van. Even though every year the rear heater lines would rot out there was nothing really done other than regular maintenance. The a/c stopped working after hitting my second deer. But other than those things you could run this van through hell and it wouldn't even get a scratch I even took it muding once. good job Kia you built a bullet proof tank "
"We put A LOT of miles on this van!  Over 180,000 miles on this van and still going.I keep changing the oil and it keeps going!I've had to replace the water pump twice and the coil packs went out so we replaced those.Air conditioner worked well up 'til last summer.The suspension doesn't seem to be that great and I haven't sprung to replace the struts although the van needs it-- but really, how many more miles am I going to be able to put on it?I'm really happy with it over all."
"Kia driven for 133,000  I bought my Kia new in 2004 and have riven it for over 133,000 miles.Overall the car has performed well without unreasonable mechanical problems; except, the lines for the rear heater have rusted out twice.The first time I paid over $600 to replace them and Kia just said, ""Gee, I am sorry to hear you had that problem.""Reviews that criticizeKia for not doing something better for their customers are correct.Also the rear window defrost has failed. I have not experienced any problem with rust on my Kia and I live in Michigan. As my car has aged, in the recent months it has experienced a series of problems; for which I am considering replacing it. Everything gets old eventually."
"Still going strong at 120,000 miles.   I have previously posted here as FRUGAL DRIVER (see below). This van, bought in 07 with 64K, is still going strong as a half ton hauler and work van. Today its going 750 miles (and back in three days) in my wife's hands to take KID MARK I to university for the first time. Had a/c fixed--damage inflicted on a hose by an idiot. Now that the OBAMA CAFE rules have effectively removed small pickups (Chev 10, Ford Ranger)& the old vans (ASTRO etc) from the US market, what are you doing to drive? This van will haul a half ton well.It takes abuse if you maintain it well. Drive it gently.This vehicle was originally built as a light truck for the S. Korean Army (02-06 model). Its tuff."
"Where do I start?  I am always amazed to see newer Sedonas on the road.I can't understand why anyone would buy one of them anymore.My car had so many problems during the warranty that I was one of 10 people across the U. S. to participate in a J.D. Powers interview at my local Kia dealership.Several engineers from Korea were there also to examine my car along with J.D. Powers staff.The whole thing was taped for whatever reason.Front brakes including the rotors have to be replaced every 20K.Front tires and struts, and engine mounts, ditto.Horn was replaced at least six times.A/C proportioning valve had to be replaced.Rear deck lid struts went out quickly."
"Best low cost to maintain & value mini-van I ever had!  Had a 2004 EX till recently it was totaled in a rear end collision. Gr8 ride, gr8 comfort, gr8 entertainment system, gr8 value! Front wheel drive makes all the difference, plenty of room for carting kids or Home Depot supplies. Gr8 acceleration & driving stability. Only knock is the gas mileage was not very good but I changed my driving technique & went from 16mpg to almost 20 (19.8)mpg!"
"Not bad but ages prematurely  Bought new from dealer end of '03. This minivan has plenty of power and ample passenger room. However, cargo space is very limited. Ran flawlessly the first 1.5 years, then brakes began to squeal. We replaced the brakes on warranty twice in the first 50K miles, a bit undersized for weight of the vehicle, maybe? Also replaced wheel bearings, again on warranty. The Kia dealership where we bought and service the car is tops, but I wish we didn't have to spend so much time visiting with them on warranty issues. Now the engine sounds like it's getting tired. We're Trading it in this weekend (probably not another Kia) before it gives up the ghost for good. "
"Update to review of 07/11/2009  Still very happy with vehicle. TIRES: OEM spec. 215/70/15 with a passenger grade is rubbish. Upgrade to 225/70/15 in a light truck/SUV tire. Currently using Michelin LTS MS. Ride quality and rubber longevity greatly improved! Transmission: buy dealer fluid for this van, have independent change it. This vehicle has a tranny cooler, so if you are hauling in hot weather, you are fine. Gas mileage: 14/16 city, 20-24 highway. That including towing 3500 lbs (as rated) and carrying weight. "
Nice Domestic Sports Car  I have had the GT about a year and I 
What a mess  I was told by the sales person that my van had the highest safety rating; don't believe it. I had to replace the wheel bearings and brakes. all the steel cooling lines rusted.  it overheats for no reason.  The steel lines coming from the radiator rusted.  The blue book is low; I can't get financing for another vehicle because of low trade-in value.
"Junk  Bought the vehicle because I was told they are a great buy for the price. Nothing but problems with the piece of junk since.  Had to change the power steering pump, always needs an alignment,  unknown overheating problem.  This overheats when it wants to with no explanation for it.  Changed thermostat, radiator lines, water pump and fluid.  Still over heats when it wants.  Now it needs new struts and what they call a transmission but really is a trans axle.  Was told it was like putting a snow blower tranny into a van. Lots of rust around the rear hatch handle.  Motor is very loud.  Overall, just a huge piece of junk.  Do not buy in my opinion.  Will never recommend a Kia to anyone.  "
"I Love My Kia  We bought this van used with 49,000 mi. All we have done is oil changes, tires, and brake pads. and also a front wheel bearing. It has about 74,000 mi now and I can't complain one bit about the maintenance . It all comes under wear and tear. I love it but it is to big for us now so I would go to something smaller. At least when you  step on the brakes you stop. "
"Don't buy a used one  The warranty is not honored if you are NOT the original owner.  They have have problems with steering due to winter salt but no recall.  Also a problem with the cooling hoses to the rear and again no recall.  They have been aware of these but will NOT cover the expense since we were not the first owner even though we bought it with 48,000 miles.  We now have a car with 78,000 miles and NO warranty."
"rust  We discovered that the steel lines that run to the heater rusted out just after the vehicle ran out of warrenty.  The customer service team at Kia Corporation was terrible to deal with.  We had documentation that the part started to rust while within warranty and the service department at the dealership even confirmed this, but they still would not consider a compromise on repairs.  "
"awful  we bought this car with 28k miles in the hopes of a low mileage car which would provide a solid, low maintenance vehicle for a number of years.  mea culpa - you get what you pay for.  from the brakes (calipers, rotors, pads) to the wiring system (complete shorts in the auto locks and windows) to the suspension, i believe its mostly assembled out of hobby wire and aluminum foil."
"kia sedona 2004  I bought my minivan at 45,000 miles and starting 3 months later started having problems. It literally took 5 trips in for service to figure out why it was stalling out and I had a rental that they paid for at one instance for 2 months!!!!! Now I'm having trouble again and it looks like a transmission issue as well as rusted out cooling lines. I would NEVER by a kia again. It is a poorly made car."
"Thanks went back to American companies  Driving this van felt like I was driving a bus. Fit and finish was fine no complaints there. Seating was made for smaller people. I am 6'1"" and 300 lbs Wife like the seating and she only 5'2"". Gas mileage was in line with a heavy vehicle s powered by underpower unit. What made the final draw for me was Kia dealership not backing the product. Had bad front rotors after 25,000 miles and it was not covered under warranty. Was told rotors and pads are my cost. Pads I could see, rotor no way. Brakes where not made for the weight of this van. Drove it across to Ford and trade it in. Good new the trade in value was 12,000. See my review on Sport Trac on what warranty is all about."
"Not worth the money   Of course a new van is gonna be nice and not have problems, but after a year the transmission was making noise and not performing well. Than 4 years later, the power steering pumb and something else is out, tranny is bad and motor acts up. Only has 32,xxx miles and should be running great! It doesn't. It was the main transportation for my handicap grandmother, who now has to relay on finding other people to take her places like her doctors apt! The van sits in the street broke down, and we still owe $3,000 on it. Can't trade it in, cause we owe more than its worth. Quilfys for a Clunker, but we ow money. So we are stuck with this piece of junk KIA. Never get another one! "
"Worth the money  Solid, dependable transportation. Used for carpool and as a construction material transporter (built on a truck chassis, takes the weight, more flexible than a small pick-up). Search parts suppliers on the web to avoid buying dealer parts, have yr. local mechanic install them, example, brake pads, rotors, struts. Change all fluids often to ensure vehicle longevity. Be prepared for front end issues as with all front wheel drive vehicles (see above comment re: parts). Now 90,000 miles, runs well, maintenance about $500/yr. all in. (Fluids and repairs). Seats are uncomfortable to install or remove. Belt tensioner requires tightening flywheel occasionally-cost=0"
Great Ride  There will always be a 05-09 mustang for sale and their fairly reasonable. Purchased mine as second car and I believe it was a great investment
"Worst Mustang ever, Don't buy Ford !!!  09/23/06 I financed a '06 Mustang GT, my 1st new car. Previously my family and I have had about 10 Fords. after 6 mos. the car stalled out, I didnt think anything of it. In'07 the problem became more noticeable I also had the battery replace twice. The alternator and L/F headlight (water). In'08 the problem became more frequent stalling between 30-40mph. The dealer couldnt find thr problem after frequent visits. In Feb.'09 I was going to trade it in for a used '08 Shelby GT500. The deal fell apart when the belt kept tearing. Took it to another dealer and was told crank was bad, waited 2 mos. to have engine rebuilt. called cust.service they're very nasty. Lemon law,govt agencies,legal no help"

"I will buy another!  Purchased our 2004 KIA Sedona LX new near the end of 2004.  Lots of extended highway driving when we go on trips, and the van performs well.  20-22mpg on the highway if we keep it under 70mph.  I have replaced the original tires (56K miles), and windshield (rock cracked it).  No other work outside of normal scheduled maintenance (fluid changes, tire rotation).  Will need to have the front brakes serviced for the first time when 60K miles rolls around.  Interior has worn well, except for the driver's side floor where the carpet is dirty.  Van is driven every day, regardless of weather, so it gets quite dirty in the winter.  Once this van is paid off, I'll be purchasing another KIA!"
"Sedona Big on Comfort   Performance when not in the shop this van drove and handled great but only gets 13/mpg.  Serious problems with the quality of all interior materials: plastic (crumbles), carpet and cloth headliner (tear easily).  I question quality of materials used on motor and other parts, within 4 years I've replaced all the motor mounts, timing chain, transmission, CV boots and both power window motors and both sliding doors quit working. Van is really roomy inside.  Front seats very comfortable, back are seats okay somewhat stiff. Seats are really heavy but easy to get in/out. Lots of headroom in this van. You do feel quite a bit of vibration through the floor from the road and it is a bit noisy inside"
"Run Away Fast!!  When will the nightmare that is my car experience with a Kia end? We bought this car used. It only had 23,000 miles on it and had heard it was a very safe car and a good deal. My advice, if it is cheap, its cheap for a reason! Since owning this car three years ago, we have had to repair the brakes every year without fail. Replaced the rotors twice, the front bearings, failed wire in seatbelt and airbag, serpentine belt (along with every other belt in creation), power steering (ouch$) and the alternator. Of course all after the warranty was up and guess what, if you buy it used, you don't get the powertrain warranty! We were not told this info. So any faulty parts we must pay for. Run away!!"
"Rust / Corrosion Problem on my Sedona EX  Rust appeared on the hood of our 2004 Sedona EX about 2 years ago. It started as small pimples/spots below the grill both on the inside and the outside. The cost for repair is $1102.64 and their offer is that we each pay 1/3! Dealership 1/3, KIA Canada 1/3, customer 1/3. I also only have a limited time to accept this offer? They insist that this is an isolated problem, even after I sent them pictures of 5 other 2004 Sedona vehicles with identical rust marks and a promise to send more. Also please be aware that if you do have a Sedona around this age make sure you insist that they check the REAR COOLANT LINES. These are also starting to rust out."
"Very disappointed  I bought this vehicle with 45000 miles.  Just 3 weeks after I got it, it went back in the shop for new rotors and struts.  Had it 6 months and the catalytic converters went totally out.  Had to get those replaced.  The air conditioner had to be replaced within 2 mo.  The gas mileage is very poor.  Might as well be driving a big SUV. Total lemon!  I am very dissatisfied with this vehicle and would never step foot into another KIA again."
"What di you expect it is a mini van!  Not much to say. If you are looking for a speed demon that turns like it is on rails this is not the vehicle for you. If you are like me and have a family that likes to travel a lot and need the extra space this is a nice choice. IMHO way better than any north American minivan but not as good as a Honda or a Toyota on par with the Nissan. I bought it used to save $$$ as the sedona has a terrible resale value and is an excellent used buy.  It handles great for a van, a bit noisier than most mini vans but feels solid and well built. Acceleration was more than adequate and I'm overall happy with this vehicle."
"So far replaced 75% of the van  It all started not 7 months after I purchased it with the battery, then plugs @ 15,000 miles they blamed the condition of the plugs on champion?  Each 3 months it was something else, this year the entire transmission. And the 5th set of rotors 3rd set of belts 2nd ac sys. Control panel have so many claims on this van, it's almost getting to be routine, like changing your oil, I like the engine but if that so much as misfires I'm done with it!  It has always had a problem firing upon starting, gonna have the plugs looked at again wrote them a letter, they sent me a 500.00 check, all I wanted was an extended warranty I feel I deserve that after 26 unscheduled repairs in 4 yrs!"
"Great price not so great car  Our family bought the van used in 12/07 and already has had internal engine issues and timing chain/cover replacements and found out it has had major engine work previously and it only has 21,000 miles. Almost everything was covered by warranty although it did take them 5 weeks because a certain part had to be shipped from Korea. I think this is not a good running car because of the problems I've had. When the car runs it is all in all a cheap but pretty good van"
"MPG  I can't believe the mileage I get 14 mpg city. I live in Florida and the ac is on all the time . But I should get better than that . May-be not on second thought . The tack reads 2,500 at 70 miles a hour . My sons car reads 1,800 at 70 mph . When they rev that tight ( 2,500 ) I can't see any increase in mileage . A friend of mine bought a 06 with the same problem. (he got rid of the Kia ). I installed a ne kn filter . Maybe I can get an increase . Going on the highways this week . Stand by ."
"Ok for new van  I traded a 1990 Dodge gran caravan for the red 2004 lx Kia Sedona. Found it roomy for its smaller size. Plenty of storage compartments and the am/FM/cd player was great extra power outlets helpful for charging cell phones etc found the 3.5 6 cyl to be fast and the overdrive trans well suited the vans performance, but fuel mpg was rate 16 I'm lucky to get 13 city 16 hwy Cruise control works well saves fuel on long trips. In four years of ownership have had to replace the fuel pump. Front brakes. Alternator, battery, front heater fan, all covered by the warranty except the brakes. Dealer maintenance is high over length of warranty 10 yrs 100,000 miles, paint has held up well except around the door handles"
"Short and simple  Owned my mustang for four yrs.,it is 
stored winters and I couldn't be 
happier with it."
Dependable Transportation  I bought this van in sep. 2005. It has been pretty dependable. I have 57000 miles and other than routine maintenance and brakes I haven't had to do a thing. Gas mileage is O.K. for a van (low 20 mpg). Roomy if you have kids.
Kia Sedona  It's nice to drive and solid. Consumes more gas and getting only 14 mpg. Brakes are very bad and make a weird sound within 10 miles. Tires are very bad.
2004 Kia Sedona for Better or Worse  I have owned this Kia for over 2 years and it is a great auto to own; for the money you could not buy a better van with all the equipment on it. The gas mileage is the only problem I have had to date; I get 10 to 12 in city and 15 to 16 on highway. They say everything is ok with the car but still gas mileage doesn't lie. Other than that it is a GREAT CAR!
I love my Sedona  Absolutely no problems. Plenty of power and very comfy to drive. Lots of room for family and lots of stuff. We take it and all our stuff to the beach whenever possible.
Very Disappointed!  Our '04 Kia Sedona has been reliable for the most part.  We have had a few major problems with the air conditioning.  The size of this van is very small and is not a 7 passenger van but more of a 6 passenger van. I can't fit all my groceries in the back cargo space.  13 mpg is not acceptable.  The third row and second row seats are very hard to remove. The driver and passenger seats and head rests are very uncomfortable.
Great Kia  We bought this van to replace our 1997 Nissan Quest and this van surpasses the Nissan by a very large margin. We like everything about this van aside from the fact that the gas mileage is not up to par. But that is because of the extra weight but I will gladly sacrifice a little mpg for the safety in rain snow and windy conditions. 
"Only had it a month ...  But I love it. Great value minivan. No ego, no flash, but it's great for the kids and groceries. A little slow to blow hot air on cold mornings, and the turning radius is ridiculously wide. Other than that, no complaints.  Purchased Dec. 2005 with 9k miles for $14,500.  DVD, sunroof, EX model with ABS."
"very unhappy  I have driven many minivans, most drive more like a car. This one feels more like a truck. Vibration at low speeds and an engine hum all the time. Pick up isn't very good. Turning radius is very poor, but above all gas performance is extremely bad; like 13 miles to a gallon. I wish I would have paid a little more and gotten another brand."
"Most practical vehicle I have ever owned  Have owned luxury vehicles and several trucks; the minivan is the most practical, and one of the most comfortable overall, I have ever owned. I am sold on minivan ownership; it can be a luxury car most of the time, then when necessary remove 2 rows of seats, and you have a truck with more space than my Ford Ranger 4x4, which I also was very fond of."
"Pretty good minivan  I've driven this vehicle on several long trips and have had no problems. Other that routine maintenance, its been trouble free. The mpg is a little better than advertised. Overall, I've averaged 21 mpg. It could be better. Acceleration is very good for such a heavy vehicle. The interior is comfortable in cold or hot weather. There are several interior features that make this minivan very people/kid friendly."
"Great Car  I have had no problems with my car. It 
has been a joy to own, and great fun to 
drive."
"We walked away from a high speed crash  I do not normally write reviews but I do read them all the time for any item that I consider buying.  I thought it was time that I wrote one.  Husband, 2 kids and I (3 months pregnant) were hit from behind in our Kia Sedona by an SUV.  We were on a highway traveling about 65 mph and were hit by a driver who fell asleep at the wheel, had accelerator to the floor and hit us at 80 mph plus.  Kids were in the middle row and not a scratch or bump on them.  Third row was intact and untouched.  If my kids had been in a regular car, they would have been seriously injured or killed.  Keep your family safe and put them in a minivan or SUV.  Thanks Kia.  That 5 star safety rating saved our lives."
"Worst car I've ever owned!  I've had nothing but transmission problems with my car since 9,000 miles.  The dealership has made every excuse they can think of to not fix the problem.  Supposedly at 18,000 miles they replaced the transmission with a rebuilt one.  Problems still existed after the supposed replacement.  Now they say that the transmission is no good because of the tires being of a different circumference even though they are marked the same size, refusing to fix the transmission.  The car is in my opinion, junk and the dealership is a sham. Oh, they also had to replace the engine 2 weeks after the worked on the transmission.  Seems the serpentine belt broke and got into the timing belt.  "
"Disappointed  I am disappointed with the 2004 Kia Sedona.  Very poor gas mileage, about 12 mpg in town.  Quality is poor.  Rear hatch has a 'clunk' sound when opening and the windows have the same when when closing.  The bench seat in the middle is a big hassle.  Dealer said the middle and rear seats are interchangeable which they are not.  I will not buy another Kia."
Great Value  Steering Wheel buttons rubbing off.  Bumpers withstand very little without paint chip.  Typical lack of room in regular sized minivan and/or SUV
"2004 Kia Sedonna Review  I currently have 13,000 miles on this vehicle and have had virtually no problems with it.  I love the ride and functionality of this van.  It is on par with any other van on the market and at a much better price.  "
"great minivan  very comfortable, less cash, same features as other minivans, reliable, great service at kia, kids enjoy the ride"
"IN STYLE  I bought this van because of the looks, 
reputation, crash test rating and 
warranty. Eight months down the road, I 
still like it very much. The stability 
and handling are excellent, I like the 
fact that it weighs so much. Very well 
put together, and comfortable interior. 
The ride is quiet, power is surprising 
for a 6 cylinder-195 horsepower engine."
"Unbeatable Value  The Kia Sedona can't be beat for its
combination of value, features, and 10
yr warranty.
 I compared the Sedona to a fully loaded
Honda Odyssey at $32,000. I paid $20,700
for my Sedona EX, including a
manufacturer's rebate of $3,000. I added
a very nice aftermarket 11"" DVD/MP3/VCD
player, seat heaters and a remote
starter for less than $2,000. The
$10,000 difference was too much for me
to justify.
 Most people that end up buying Kia are
looking for a big warranty and big bang
for the buck. I am very happy knowing
that my car will be fully warrantied
until it is paid off. I think today's
Korean cars are right where the Japanese
were in the 80s: unbeatable value,
performance, and reliability."
"Kia 2004  had a hard time actually buying a 
minivan, but works well for my family."
alot for your money   THE BEST THING I FOUND ABOUT KIA IS 
Mustangs are the best  They have good values and i want a nice

"2004 kia sedona ex  just bought a new sedona with all the 
bells and whistles as a gift for my 
wife. had some problems with the 
service dept. at dealer from options i 
had installed. vehicle rides great and 
the leather seats are comfortable. 
rearview eyesight is hindered if dvd 
player is in use while driving making 
side mirrors a top priority. for a van 
of this weight it has good acceleration 
and handles well for the type driving 
we do. engine always seems to be in 
right gear. interior noise level is a 
little bit higher than expected, but 
playing the radio helps to block some 
of that out. door handles could seem a 
bit more sturdy and not have that could 
break any moment feel. overall love our 
new kia sedona ex..."

rebuilt a 73 Mach 1 Mustang that I 
fell in love with.  I just couldn't 
wait to buy another Mustang with that 
classic American V8 muscle car sound

I wanted one since the day it came out and I'm not sorry for the purchase. I get a lot of compliments. So far I have not had any problems what so ever. I have taken it to the Ford dealership I purchased it from for oil changes and everytime so far everything has been 100%"

"Delayed Reaction  First new car...thought it was 
amazingly fast and handled superbly.  
Then I got dusted by nearly every other 
new car on the road.  A bigger motor 
would tear this cheaply made car apart 
if the wheels could ever get a grip on 
the pavement.  My tires deflate on 
their own.  My paint is fading.  
Everytime I bring the car in for 
maintenance, it comes out stained or 
sloppily re-assembled. Seatbelt rollers 
broken, controls for power driver seat 
popping out, no air flows to passenger 
side vents. Car shakes at 70 mps - ford 
won't fix bec. mechanics won't drive 
that fast to find problem."

my 4th one), and I am not 
disappointed.  It is hard to handle in 
the ice and rain, but has only been in 
the shop 2x for major repair since I 
have owned it.  A computer modulator

"My Sweetheart  Its the fourth year that I own this 
car,  and this is an absolute beauty 
both inside the hood and out.   With 
jet black exterior and black leather

Asphalt of the Texas roads.    I 
haven't had any issues and well... I 
knew the deal with the gas guzzling 
when I got the car so won't complain.   
If any complaints,  its the guranteed

reliable, and cheap.  Every once and a 
while I go looking at new (much more 
expensive) cars and I end up asking 
myself, ""why?"".  Only problem I've had 
is a vibrating clutch pedal that's 
been there since it was new.  Every 
time I take it in, the mechanic either 
wants to replace the whole clutch 
(which they did once, under warranty), 
or he says, ""they all do that"".  It's 
annoying, but I live with it.  Put a

even great in the snow!"

"Love it!   I just recently bought a 2000 White Mustang Convertible. I have the automatic version and have not regretted it since I bought it. The gas mileage isn't great...I only get about 300km on each tank, but its so worth it. This car is fun to drive, especially when you put the top down and hear that engine. Its powerful and turns heads. Mine has the leather and suede interior which is a nice feature as all leather can get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. Only complaint would be the brakes squeal a bit...its easily fixed with brake cleaner but I've heard is a common issue with this year and model. Either way I'd fully recommend this car! So fun to drive, and good looking. "

Still in love with her!  I purchased her brand new! Worth every penny! 10 years later she is still fun to drive. Hugs roads and has great pick up. I would buy again. Issues were the exhaust manifold design is bad. I think the A/C drips onto it and as a result had to have it welded back together twice because it sounded like a hole in the muffler. Also the clutch went out on her 2 years ago and that had to be replaced. Other than those 2 things I have not had one single mechanical issue. She is picky about her tires. Anything but Yokahoma's seem to run rough. Extremely reliable. Cosmetics after 10 years: my top leaks in behind the back seat due to being left in the sun and not in a garage. Middle tail light faded.

great car bad battery and window system  I love to drive the car and to look at the car.  I have had problems with the battery draining.  I've jumped it 5 times.  I've also had problems with the driver side window.  I had to take it to the dealership 2 times for the same issue.  The 3rd time it was out of warranty and the dealership didn't want to take ownership of the problem.
Old Reliable.  I commuted 160 miles a day in this and have 202000 on it.  Engine still running great. Top is now ready to be replaced last much longer than I thought.

"Mustang Sally   My daughter and son-in-law bought this car for me, brand-new as a gift in 2000.  I love this car and have lots of fun driving it.  It has never had anything go wrong with it in the 9 years that I have owned it.  It is a beautiful black convertible, very sleek and sporty.  This is my second Mustang (owned the first model in 1965) and I highly recommend them."

"Powerful, Reliable V8   An all around great quality car.  I highly recommend it.  The V8 has plenty of power, I have added exhaust and Intake which are a must for this model.  The exhaust adds that mean rumble while the intake adds hp and saves major gas.  The only down side is the interior is cheap, but doesn't look too bad.  It is also rough in the winter, but what car isn't?"

"We don't fix it, we have a better Idea  I bought this car in 2001 with 60k miles on the car. My wife wanted a convertible and this car had a higher entry into the car than the GM F- bodies. So, I work a good deal and drove it home. Within 6 month I had to replace the alternator and battery. No biggy. About to months later the coil pack. Well this went on about every 4 to 5 months. Also within the first year I had to remove the intake and clean it because of carbon build up. For use a poorly designed valve cover which lets engine gases escape into the PVC line. At 120,000 miles the head gasket blew, and I had enough of this car breaking down. The door windows hit the top when opening and closing. 2005 got the better idea fix."

Great summer car  I purchased my Mustang about 2 years ago in Florida and then moved back north.  This car has been wonderfully reliable taking me to and from Florida.  My only complaint regarding long trips is that the driver's seat is horribly uncomfortable and I really get poor gas mileage.  Until recently I haven't had any problems with the car.  Lately the convertible top back near the window has been leaking and now I am dealing with wet floors.  I think it is mostly due to the Florida sun drying out the top for 5 years since it was never garage kept. I get tons of compliments though!

"2000 V6 Convertible  I bought this car a year and a half ago with 24000 miles, now it has a bit over 50000. Absolutely no mechanical issues to date. Always starts right up, even in the dead cold of winter. Plenty of power for a V6 and gas mileage is good for a V6. I was wary to buy a Ford after owning an 1989 Escort in the past that was garbage, but this car looked so shiny and lonely when I first saw it, just pleading to be driven, and I fell in love with it. It's such a pleasure to drive, especially with the top down. Its a real head turner too, I always get complements on it. I highly recommend this car and would definately buy another Mustang in the future. Take car of it and it will take care of you."

"Surprising Performance  I wasn't looking for a Mustang and have never been a big fan. I saw this 7 year old vehicle with less than 55k miles while looking at other convertibles. I gave it a try because of the low price and was really impressed. I actually liked the handling better than Mustang GT convertibles I'd driven. I was surprised by how powerful the V6 felt with the 5 speed manual. My particular car must have spent a lot of time in the garage based on the low mileage, tight feel, and nearly flawless interior and exterior. I thought I'd miss the quick open/close of the top that I had with a Miata, but this power top is fast and seems well made. On the road the blue color seems one of the least common."

"Mystang  Well my mom got this Mustang in 03 for a real good deal. It's one of a kind (black w/ white top and white leather). Now I drive it mostly and I have to say it is fun. It is quite poor at low rps however when it's up there, it's really up there. Had tranny problems and power widow control sank into door. Fog lights are constant problem. Back seat is nonexistent and front is uncomfortable. Stereo is awesome though. other than above mentioned problems, this car seems quite reliable."

"Bac to the Future  The car reminds me of a Porsche I owned. Most stable performance from a convertible, no less. I like the long throw shift better on this car than a 2007. "

Great Car  It's noisy. It rides rough.  It's uncomfortable on long trips.  It's great on gas. It looks great.  It has not let me down.  I wouldn't trade it for another.....Unless it was a newer one.  This is my second one. It's all mine.  And it's payed off!
"Fun in the Stang  I purchased this car last spring after I was in an accident in my 2000 Mustang coupe.  The convertible is a lot more fun of a car to drive around, and I have been very happy with the reliability of both of the cars.  I love the look and drive of the car as well, and recommend the manual transmission, and the V6 if you are doing your own maintenance (more room in the engine compartment makes it easier to access).   Road noise and comfort of the convertible make it much less enjoyable on long road trips.  After an hour or two on the highway with the top down, your ears will be ringing for hours afterwards.   Also you will need excellent tires or more weight in the back to keep traction in rain or snow."

"Pretty good vehicle  Had this car almost 6 years - purchased new.  Haven't had a single problem. Runs like a breeze and everything is original.  Body is still very tight and looks great.  Mach stereo is awesome and sounds best with the top down.  Car is a lot of fun to drive, steering is a little heavy, especially when trying to parallel park.  Engine is fast on the top end, slow down low.  Can still beat 2006 Acuras and many Porsches. Very happy with workmanship - the car looks and drives just as good as the day I bought it without a single squeak.  Hope to keep for another 50 years."

"The horse keeps trottin'  I purchased my car private party about 3 years ago. In the 3 years of owning it, I have come to find a few things. These are very tight convertibles, well made with a lot of power.  They are also one of the quietest on the road with the top up. Plenty of power, and decent gas mileage around town, but can get very good when on the open road driving long distances.  Coming from a 5.0, I was hesitant on a 4.6 car, but made sure I got a 99-up with the 265HP. Plenty of power to set you straight.  My only issue is the coolant sensor light that seems to be a typical issue with the 99-00 cars.  Get a 5 speed. The resale on the automatic cars is poorer."

"Awesome  I have read everyone's reviews about this Mustang, and I must say, I have had no problems with my car ever!  Not only that but the people that I bought it from also had no problems with this car.  So I'm sorry for those of you who have had bad experiences, mostly it was the fact you had a bad dealer, but the car itself is amazing; fast, quick, and very comfortable (for two people, the back seat is kinda small)."

"Not my best Ford  Bought from CarMax at 18k miles  1k miles later they rebuilt the rear gear box to try to get rid of the moaning sound between 40 and 50 miles an hour on deceleration.  Never worked.  At 90k the gear box was rebuilt again because of a constant whir. Let's see, at 70k I got a new front end. Top's starting to leak. Valves tap a lot if you don't keep cleaning the injectors ($$).  Travel 150 miles a day at an average 72 miles an hour.  Time to clean injectors again and probably replace the egr valve.  My 9th Ford and probably my last if Toyota makes a larger truck."

"Love my  'stang  I love my convertible. My kids (4 and 
5) love it too.  There is nothing like 
cruising down the road with your top 
down and enjoying life. I have ridden 
in other convertibles (Sebring) and 
yuck! I wouldn't trade my Mustang for 
one. It is comfortable, fun, reliable 
and most of all a conversation piece 
wherever I go.  Especially in East 
Tennessee where I live.  My car is an 
Electric Green color and Cleopatra (my 
car) gets eye-balled coming and going! 
So anyone that is thinking about 
getting a Mustang, I would definitely 
encourage getting a convertible! They 
are too much fun!"

"No problems  I have had my convertible for over a 
year now and have had absolutely no 
problems.  It is just an automatic v-6 
mustang but it is still fun and 
comfortable to drive.  All of the 
problems that I have heard of from 
people who have owned convertibles are 
non-existent.  I have had no problems 
with leaks, tears, or cuts.  Being in 
college I was also looking for a 
dependable car that would have no 
problems with trips home.  I put 
higher performance touring tires on it 
and it drives much better."

only 8,500 miles. It was babied by the 
original owner. I have put another 
7,000 miles on it during the non-
winter months. Great to drive, ultra-
sharp looking, have not had one 
problem yet. Best present I ever

"Good car  I bought this car new in 2000.  It's 
held up well (but not great) and has 
been good transportation.  The fact 
that it's stylish and performs well 
doesn't hurt, either.  As a 
convertible, it's as solid as anything 
else on the road today (at least in the 
under-$30k market).  The interior is 
great - it's comfortable and it has 
solid ergonomics.  That being said, I 
dinged the interior a couple of points 
because of cheap materials and 
appearance.  All in all, a great car 
for the money."

"Dreams are well worth working for!  I've always wanted a V8 Mustang since my dad showed me a certain Steve McQueen movie called Bullitt, I just loved the styling and ferocity of McQueen's highland green '68 fastback GT. Nothing else was cooler.  Then Ford released the '05 model, now that's a Mustang! Well in a nutshell I found a tungsten grey '06 GT auto with 7k on it and bought it. Best decision ever. I love this V8! It's fast and it sounds great, though mine now sports a cold air intake and Pypes Violator exhaust and it turns heads with it's loud rumble.  Also this car is built extremely well. 31k on it and not even a rattle, not a problem. This is one I WILL NOT BE TRADING IN!"
imustang  this car is an excellent car. i wouldnt

First Ford  I have been very pleased for the most part with my 06 Mustang GT.  I think the retro styling of the car is great.  It's like driving a 60s Mustang only better.   The steering response is great and it corners like a dream.  I am 6'2 and have never had a car that felt this comfortable. The Shaker 500 sounds awesome.  I have had aftermarket setups that didn't sound as good.  I only have a couple complaints. The rubber strips used to seal the inside of the windows scratch the hell out of my window tint when running them up and down.  There is a rattling noise under hard acceleration that almost sounds like detonation; but I am running 92 octane fuel and have ruled that out.   Very impressed

"Dream Come True!!!  Long before the time I was old enough 
to even sit behind the wheel of a car I 
dreamed of owning a mustang. That dream 
finally came true and I could not be 
happier. This 2000 silver mustang 
convertible with a black top is simply 
amazing, From performance to looks. I 
believe that body style of the mustang 
from '99-04 is one of the best body 
styles since the mustangs of 19641/2-
67. I wish the gas mileage was a little 
better but, I can not complain because 
I am finally driving a mustang."

"Great Fun  Never had such fun in a ragtop. 
Handling is nice and involving, I can 
throw out the back end and control it. 
It zips round country lanes with ease; 
it turns heads; it leaves boy racers 
standing. Now where can I get me the 
money for a Saleen SC?"

"my 42nd car  I have the v6 convertable with 5 speed 
in blue/black top/leather interior.
No mechanical failures with car. No 
data on 5 speed aside from my own-no 
problems, notchy,occ missed shift. 
Insurence is expencive, a new Corvet 
would only be $7.50 more per month, an 
RX 8 would be $2.50 less per month.
  The v6 with 5 speed is about as 
quick as the v8 with automatic, and 
provides enough performance to satisfy 
most people who want v8 power.
  The convertable top is excellent-
shows no wear after 4 years of taking 
it up and down daily in the blazing 
Arizona sun.
To sum it up- a bargain used 
performance car that is dependable and 
fun, but expencive to insure.

has been a great car. Still has 
original brake pads after over 85000 
miles plus does not burn any oil. Nice 
and comfortable with plenty of pickup 
for passing.Looking forward to turning 
100,000 next year since it has been 
trouble free since I bought it and will 
continue to drive it.Thanks Ford, this 
was a nice surprise."

"2006 gt premium  Bought new, my red dream stang has performed, well, overall. Interior, passenger side vent rattles, interior tail light housing held in place by flimsy, plastic screw assemblies. Closing the trunk causes the rear lights to blink. On positive side, average over 20.5 miles per gallon, everywhere!. Car used mainly to go to gym and back and to the beach on weekends. Runs fast, but interior is noisy. Hope Ford adds interior insulation package to 2010"

another 22k miles. I have experienced 
absolutely no problems and the car 
runs great. A couple months back, I

"Just A Stang  I bought this car for my wife in 2000. 
The next day went out and put 2 stage 
flows on it to make it rumble.  It 
guzzles gas, is a little sluggish on 
the bottom, but once it gets going it 
is fairly fast.  My Ford F150 has more 
torque and is quicker off the bottom.
Overall, it is fun to drive, but is 
very loud (ragtop)and the tranny has 
already gone out. Thank god it was 
under warranty.  It has been a fun car, 
but it rattles a lot and feels loose 
with only 27,000 miles. I won't buy 
another one."

"Not bad at all  I think this drop top is a great bang 
for the buck. It has aggressive and 
beautiful styling and will give you the 
power you want. I love the shifter! But 
the cupholders are too close to it. 
Someone in the ford company messed up 
here! When you shift to 2nd or 4th you 
always hit it cup, leading the contents 
to conveiniently spill all over! But i 
find the interior to be comforting, it 
flows away from you, leaving the 
feeling you have more space. This car 
will make you crave what the 8 has in 
store. The leg room is no problem but 
don't place to be bringing anyone 
around in the back seat comfortably, 
but then again, this is not to be 
mistaken with a minivan!"

on and on but way waste my time.  In 
closing, the car is for sale now and I 
will NEVER by a FORD product again!"

"not perfect, but pretty good  I bought this car used with 3200 miles 
on it.  Saved about $5k over a new 
one.  The car has been ok since I've 
owned it, I have a couple problems with 
it though.  First is the throwout 
bearing noise which Ford refuses to 
admit to hearing.  Second is a rear 
chassis squeak that they of course 
cannot hear neither.  I rarely drive 
the car now so these nuances are not 
that big of a deal.  I just installed 
Steeda Sport Springs and I can't 
believe the improvement.  Ford should 
have put these on from the start!
 Otherwise, I love the exhaust note and 
the power."

"What a car  This is one of the nicest and fun cars I have owned, and I have had plenty of sports cars. I get alot of compliments, and the sound and power is unbelievable. This car is pretty comfortable on long trips, part of the reason is for the redesigned seats compaired to the '01 mustang GT I owned."
"Mustang Fan Forever  Most fun car I have ever owned. Looks 
great,runs great, gotten tons of 
compliments on how good it looks."

"Crossing My Fingers  So, I just bought my first used car.  It's a 1999 Jeep Cherokee.  I've read Kelley's Blue Book, and the price was right on target.  It has 179,000 miles on it.  Jeep owners tell me it will still go on and on.  I've also read most of these reviews, and they all seem very positive. .The man who sold it told me it just needs a muffler; it is a bit loud.  Other than that, it rode well.  One owner.  It's my first Jeep, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  I'll be very happy if I can get at least a year out of it and, hopefully, not spend too much money on it for repairs.  But time will tell."
"awesome vehicle  We bought this 99 cherokee inline 6 back in 2004 with 70,000 miles.  Over the years the biggest repair that was needed was the rear main seal replacement at 280,000 miles.  Other than that it has been the usual replacement of parts that will eventually wear out with time. The engine has never been stripped down to do an overhaul or replace anything, besides spark plugs and the like.  Now at 305,000 miles the engine still sounds the same from when we bought it. The mpg reads 15 but i tested this and found that it is getting 21 in the city. Awesome. Oil change every 3000 miles and other regular maintenance and I believe this engine will go to 400,000 without an overhaul.  People complain about the ride being crappy which is correct, but then you don't buy a jeep for comfort.  This vehicle is a true utility truck. And it actually handles quite well in the city.  Jeep designed a great truck with the cherokee and plan on keeping this going for as long as I can. Eventually will restore this back to factory look and feel."
"Great vehicle if you can turn a wrench  I bought my Jeep kind of knowing it'd be an experience. After a year of owning it I've replaced a lot of components, but I also bought a high mileage Jeep. If you're looking into buying one it's a good purchase. It is my favorite vehicle I've owned despite being less reliable than other cars I've owned."
"IT'S A BEAST UNSTOPPABLE TANK  I bought my jeep, 171 thousand miles on it, no oil leaks or anything interior is great small areas the ceiling liner sags, but solid engine, you start it out just a get up and go, take it off road and it's agile it's quick, I take mine out to the river bed and it just goes, I mean the power and handling is perfect, I've been in lifted chevy's and toyota 4runners my STOCK jeep practically out performs them all,My only problem is which but my jeeps fault, but for where and how I drive needs a lift in the front especially but other than that it's GREAT"
"Longest Relationship To Date  I bought my 1999 Jeep Cherokee, 2WD, 6 cyl, automatic, 4-door from my employer in 2003. It was about to roll over to 100,000 miles, and they wanted to get rid of it. I paid $2500.00 broken into 4 payments. I continued to use it for work travel which was sometimes brutal temps and environments. Whenever I got my per-diem pay for using my Jeep, I would take her into Pep Boys, NLR, AR and give her whatever she needed. In 2015, she rolled over the 200,000 mark. The last 10 years I have cut way back on driving, and have not had the money to put into her care and maintenance, but she has always been true and faithful. The repairs have been few, and the cost of owning her has been a dream. I am recently at the point where I could buy a new car, but instead; I am going to have her completely restored. As I have had many mechanics tell me over the years, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Maybe I am too emotionally attached, but this Jeep has been everything I needed."
"Like this car a lot  I currently have 31,000 miles on this car and it has never been back to the dealer. I have been doing oil changes and routine maintenance. The only complaint I have is the Road noise seems a little loud to me. I get 25 MPG driving to work - mixed city/rural, and got 28 on a long trip on the freeway. "
nan
"Love my Jeep!  Needed an inexpensive SUV (wanted it to American built), so I bought this Cherokee in late 2013 w/16500 miles on her. I've added 50000 miles since I've owned it. She gets lots of looks/positive comments and at least once every couple of months someone asks to buy it. Overall, it's a great SUV.  "
"Definitely Won't be in The Market for Another Jeep  This car was a hand me down from my aunt. She and my uncle take very good care of their cars, so don't give me the whole ""you must not have taken care of it"" thing. This car has been nothing but problems. Endless electrical problems is the first issue. In less than a year that I've had this car, the automatic door locks, cruise control, trunk light, horn, airbag, and the windows have all stopped working. I've had several mechanic friends check all of the fuses and everything and they are all completely fine. I haven't taken it in yet cause I can't afford the huge costs. On top of all of that it has completely broken down twice AGAIN in just a year of having it. All in all just a huge pain. "
"An old work horse  Let me just start off by saying I love my JEEP! And there is no denying it this baby is a Jeep. Some people think the only real Jeeps are Wranglers but that's not the case, this bad boy even stock has the capability to do some pretty amazing things off road. The best part about this jeep is that while being able to take it for a fun weekend camping or 4x4ing is nice and easy its also a great car to drive on the road,in the city or on the highway. I have a 99 cherokee sport in automatic (not listed on this site if im not mistaken) and she has over 230,000 miles with nearly no major repairs aside from a starter and a new ac pump. And of course some body damage fixes but that' my fault not hers"
"Amazing car  I bought this car from my uncle at 127,000 miles. This thing is a beast. iv driven it to 182,000 miles and iv only had 2 problems. i had to replace the water pump and the rear O2 sensor. both cheap to buy and relatively easy to repair you self. i have never had a starting problem, well when its -30 out side in the morning she doesn't want to start, but she always starts. and people who complain about the drivetrain i have never had a problem, probably because i changed both rear and front differential fluid along with the transfer case fluid at about 160,000 miles, AND, i regular grease the drive shafts. All of theses are very easy to do and can significantly increase the live of a jeep."
"HORRIBLE vehicle: DO NOT BUY  This is the worst vehicle on the planet.Constant ""Death Wobble"" issues.Poorly designed.Aggravating Crank Position Sensor issues arise throughout the year (engine will not get spark causing no-start issues)."
"1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport 3DR  After buying my 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport 3DR new, I proceeded to log over 168k miles in it until 2012. No power windows, roof rack or fancy bells or whistles. I just sold it last month. Most of my milage was city/hwy driving. I averaged 17/22 MPG. Not too bad with an air conditioner. The off roading in the snow was as impressive as a Jeep commercial can leagaly put on the TV. My service record shows normal maintenance. I needed to replace the clutch at around 90K and the air conditioner was replaced at 120k. The only real problem was a clutch sensor that kept burnig out 15A fuses in the fuse box. The sensor was replaced and it ran well ever since. I liked it so much I purchsed another Jeep."
"NEVER  I AM NOT SATISFIDE! This jeep was good for about 4 months mialige 118,000 to curently 123,000 miles. Resently I`v had some major scairs. The engine on and off shakes the car. I can tell because normaly it would be a smoother feeling. At about 20 to 40 mph the car will leack forwars vilontly and will not produce power for 10 to 25 seconds.DO NOT GET THIS CAR!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport  I had a 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport. This Jeep had the 4.0L I-6 with a 4 speed automatic transmission. It was a very good vehicle for the West Virginia winters, my driveway is just over 2,000 ft up a hill, and it never failed to make it all the way to the top. I liked the vehicle, but it didn't have enough room. I would reccomend it to any of my friends."
"This thing is a tank  This thing is a tank. Parents bought it new in '99, never had a major problem with it. The engine is rock solid. 190K miles on it and going strong as when it was new. Never had any leaks or any problems at all. Have replaced some parts outside of wear parts (rear springs, U-joints, front stabilizer shock), but this thing is tougher than nails. With new shocks and rear springs, rides better than my sports car. Even ran into a tree two years ago, had it fixed, and you could never tell anything ever happened to it. We expect to keep this Jeep at least another 100K miles. We live off three miles of rough dirt road and it takes the punishment and asks for more. Best vehicle we've ever owned."
"Undervalued, in my opinion.  First car. Had it for six years until it was rear ended. Literally drove it from coast to coast with no problems. Smooth response at lower speeds with just enough torque on the highway to get you around a semi in a hurry. Handling was great around town. Good turning radius. Bumpy ride. Passengers don't enjoy it much. Backseat kinda cramped. But from the driver's seat it's not a problem. Front shocks went out along with water pump and compressor after a few years. Other than that, the engine never gave me any problems, even with my terrible upkeep. Engine was abused with stop and go driving in 100 degree heat with few oil changes the whole time I drove it. Held up great."
nan
"Over 200,000 and still the best  I got this great suv in march of 2010 for my first vehicle. I love the style and ride with the 4.0 L 6 cylinder. It's easy to drive and great for a new driver. Mine has over 200,000 miles and still sounds great. I wish jeep still made these because they are the best."
"A great friend  I am retiring my 99 Jeep Cherokee Classic.  I love this vehicle!!  It still looks great after two wrecks and a 150,000 miles.  I plan on having a little work done on it and then putting it in storage until my son turns 18 (18 years from now).  It will be a hell of a gift for him - this is truly a classic vehicle and, in a way, I wish Jeep would bring the XJ style back but in another way I love the fact that I have one and they are not as easy to get anymore."
what a lemon  i hate this car. it has died and lost all of it charm.
"Really Crappy Wiring  After 10 years, nearly every wire in the Jeep is cracking and beginning to fail. Intermittent failures in the window operators, instruments, radio. Cruise control, horn and airbag are all out of commission.  Car has never been crashed or bumped and has had only light 4wd use, but body panels are coming loose, trim strips and bumpers are falling off.  Transmission is noisy. Death wobble is getting steadily worse even after new tires, shocks, dampener and alignment.  The Jeep is the newest of my three cars and the only one that I seriously want to get rid of. VERY Disappointed."
"Impressive quality/reliability  No major problems.  Can't believe that it has lasted like this.  We take good care of it, and it looks almost new. Almost no rust - surprising for WI. Strong engine/tranny.  Interior shows almost no wear.  All repairs have been maintenance issues - nothing major. Easy to work on.  Would highly recommend."
"Love this car  I bought my jeep as a college sophomore back in 2005.  Purchased in New York where I'm from, and attending school in Savannah, GA, I knew I was in for some serious mileage.  I did my research and found a great Cherokee.  That car has been up and down the east coast at least 10 times, been in rough road in the swamps of the deep south, and it never died.  There were a few minor electrical problems, along with no CD player, however it was perfect.  I just sold it (and miss it so much!) due to another long trip across the country, but will probably buy a jeep again.  "
Great Little SUV  1999 Cherokee Sport with 4.0L I6. My 2nd Cherokee (had a 1990 5 spd) and I love both of them (family's had 4 Cherokees and they have all been great trucks). Tough little SUV that does everything you want it to. Never complains when I hit those huge New England pot holes and you can drive it in any weather you want. Taken it out in white-out snow storms in a foot of powder and it does excellent. Never crossed my mind that I'd get stuck in any condition. Not the most comfy/efficient car but its a tough little SUV that rides stiff and never complains. Great for someone looking for a tough reliable truck that will take you anywhere and won't complain about a little tough drivin
"Go Anywhere, Do Anything!  I absolutely love these vehicles. They are so reliable. I can go back to my favorite fishing spot, put the seats down and load up the back with equipment, go camping in the back, drive inns are a blast, go anywhere my wrangler owning buds go, get better gas mileage that full size trucks, all power, all electric, tow my boat jet ski four Wheeler or car trailer. This is the most awesome vehicle ever made. My 4dr 4x4 sport has 246,000 miles and still going strong. I will repair it when it needs it and never part with it."
"Jeep Cherokee  I bought my Jeep in Dec, 08 it rides very good in bad weather conditions, but the previous owner must have went off roading with it, cause the ride was very rough, replace shocks and struts an that helped alot, it had 110,000 on it an now has 123,000 been having electrical issues as of late, this is a suv that I wouldn't hesitate to buy brand new, am looking to upgrade to a 2001 with less wear an tear! Gas mileage isn't a problem as has been reported by other buyers!"
"badass jeep cherokee  I got my Jeep Cherokee when I turned 16, and it was a former border patrol unit so it had a few modifications to its factory build. It came with skid plates and yaddi yadda... Idk when it was but I just started falling in love with cars and went all out... It now has a 4.7 stroker straight 6 engine which I just recently beefed up a 3 inch suspension lift and a 1 1/2 inch body lift with 33x12.5 inch tires locked front and rear differential new full magnaflow exhaust kit slip yoke eliminator cv driveshaft the list just goes on and on.... Anyway im approaching 17 now and ive realized that if it wasnt for this car.. I still wouldnt know what I wanna do later in life... Which is work on cars someway"

"Die hard Jeep fan  Absolutely love my Jeep, I bought it from the construction co that I work for when it was 3 years old & the lease was up.  Had 60K miles on it then.  Has 185,000 now, March 09.  rarely had problems with it.  It's been all over the beaches of NC & VA & thru the snow in PA.  handled well in every situation.  Other than changing belts when they get worn, and changing the oil faithfully, I don't normally put any money in it.  I have had to replace a window motor & brakes once, but that's really about it.  My daughter will be 16 in a year & I plan on handing this reliable car down to her.  & she can't wait!!  I wish there was another Jeep I liked as much as this one that I could replace it with."
"ok  My parents bought my 99 Cherokee sport in 2000, drove it for about 5 years, and then handed it down to me. It now has 140,0000 miles on it. I have no complaints about how it runs, never had any problems with that. However, the ac has stopped working, the front speakers blew out, the rear windshield wiper doesn't work, and the handle that pops that hood was so sticky, that mechanics changing the oil completely pulled it off and now the hood won't latch and I have to put a ratchet strap around it to keep it down. It gets me from place to place, but that's about it. "
"Love my  Jeep  I bought my black Cherokee Sport 4x4 off the showroom floor. It had a whole 9 miles on it. It currently has almost 130k on it. It has only been in the shop once, for a loose torque converter. It has always gotten 19 MPG with good gas. The engine set up makes preventative maintenance easy. Even the transmission pan has a drain plug. The I-6 is essentially a tractor motor. You can't kill a tractor and you can't kill a Jeep. Maybe they should have provided a PTO, that would've been handy. I still can't believe they quit making these great vehicles. I'll run mine until the wheels fall off."
"What a truck!  This is the third Jeep I have owned aside from the old '86 Grand Wagoneer and the '93 Jeep Cherokee. Reliability has improved over the years, I bought the '99 Cherokee Limited with 72k. I have enjoyed driving this Jeep and probably will never own any other make of suv. There is not one bad word I can say about the Jeep Cherokee!"
"Ride or Die Vehicle  I absolutely could not live without my Cherokee. I've had it for 11 years. Bought it with 13,000 miles on it. It's been in four accidents (1 while parked), extensive road trips throughout upstate NY during my sorority days, and survived NYC potholes. Within the past two years, I've had to change the brake pads, thermometer, radiator, steering box, battery and have multiple electrical problems resulting in shortages in the front and rear lights. Overall, she has lasted me well as hard as I drive, and I'm looking for another vehicle as equally reliable."
"Love My Jeep  I bought this car car new. It has been reliable. 187000 miles now. Never had an issue with the transmission. Awesome offroad, and snow performance - never been stuck in mud or snow.  Part time 4x4 is great. 17 mpg average. Got 21 mpg once on highway trip. Replaced normal things- alternator, belt, brakes, tires. Stuck with regular maintenance. Replaced several window motors, and has had several electrical glitches.Recently had head gasket replaced (approx. $800) due to oil leak - first leak I've had.  Now evaporator coil is cracked ($1300 repair, or no AC). It may be getting close to time to replace, but I really don't want to get rid of it. With new tires, it's impossible to surpass off road"
"There's no replacement for Cherokee  Bought this very basic 4x4 last summer with 125k on the clock, and just grow more enthusiastic every day. Its not a luxury car, but is very tractable on-road and there is NO vehicle still in production in 2008 that can come anywhere close to matching it for balancing on-road manners and sheer offroad capability. Its also built like a tank and is unbelievably reliable. Important stuff just does not fail on this car. Fuel econ. is quite good in commuting. They're so common that they're almost forgotten- but just look around you in traffic some day and start counting, and note how many still look great. Then remember there hasn't been a new one built for 7 years. Take THAT, Toyota."
"Great 4x4  I bought this new in 99 and now have 116,000 mi on it and have not had anything go wrong, love the 4x4 goes anywhere and through anything, 3' snow drifts, no problem!  "
Unhappy  This Jeep has had the following problems: 3 transfer case replacements. Transmission replaced. U-joints failed. rides rough. Gas mileage is the worst of any car I've ever owned. This thing sucks gas big time!
"Jeep Trifecta  Bought this new in 99 and we love it.   This was to replace my car and after test drives of others kept coming back to the Cherokee, we had bought a used 90 Cherokee in 91 that my husband used for work. When we decided to replace the 90 my husband went looking for another and we now have a 2000 Sport Cherokee. These are all going strong and shouldn't need to replace for years.  The 99 gets the most mileage now as I have to travel for my job but at 130K it should last until retirement. The 90 still gets lots of use at the beach, when the kids need there cars fixed, still going strong. Bring them back Jeep, there is nothing quite like this SUV. "
nan
"My First Car  I bought my red, 5-speed Jeep Cherokee in Sept. 2006 and still have it to this date. I bought it with 85k miles on it and it now has a little more than 100k miles on it. In that time, the only problems I've had are glitchy power windows and a cracked evaporator. I was slightly weary about buying a gas guzzling SUV for my first car but after driving it for a while, I've found that it does real well. It gets about 19/20 city, but I find that keeping it just below 65 on the highway will get me 30 mpg for highway trips (and that's with a fully loaded college vehicle!). This has been and will remain a fun, reliable, and efficient first vehicle. I plan to hold onto this for a long time."
99 Sport  Always wanted a Cherokee since the early '90s.  Bought new in '99.  Goes just about anywhere you want.  Only problem was with the front windows. Both driver and passenger motor brackets broke within a year of each other and caused the window to drop to the bottom of the door. I pull a 2000 lb camper all over the Tennessee hills at 80 with no problems.  Easy to work on or modify with uncountable parts available for greater off road performance.  Limited only by your imagination. It is truly a shame that Jeep stopped making the Cherokee.  Nothing else can compare.  
"Jeeper for Life  With my 91 Cherokee Limited having 258000 miles on it I decided to buy something a little newer.  I have always loved jeeps.  The boxiness is great.  The L6 pulls my trailer and 2 atv's with no problems (sportsman 500,600).  The fuel is decent for something like this.  The auto trans is bullet proof.  They should never have stopped building these.  My only complaint is the power windows.  The sport is the most expensive to replace as it is a dealer only item.  "
"Great off road vehicle  I use the vehicle in extreme off road hunting situations. Only modification is a 3 inch lift and 6 additional lights. It goes anywhere. I am a professional guide & retired law man, & I go where a goat should not. The only thing I would like is better fuel mileage on the highway. It has the 4 ltr./auto trans. Great vehicle, for what it was made for. Have tried many others, including imports. They cannot stay close in the off road situations. Requires more than normal maintenance, but that is the price you pay "
"3rd Jeep I've had and the best so far.  I bought my Jeep when it only had 3 miles on it. I saw the truck driver when he was backing it off the delivery truck. It was Chili Pepper Red with Grey inside. I bought the extended warranty for 7 years or 100,000 miles. (DID NOT USE IT) The only problem that I have had is that the alternator went out at about 75,000 miles. I change the oil every 3500 mi and have a regular maintenance schedule. This Jeep looks as good as it drives. "
"Bring it back!  Bought this with 50K after riding through very rough terrain in a friend's Cherokee that had 250K.  I'm now at 140K. I meet people all the time who tell me they are the best vehicle ever, and who have very high mileage. I use it on very, very bad ""roads"" in the hills of backwoods East Tennessee and also to commute and to haul electronic equipment. This Jeep does it all. It's true it's not a pretty soccer mom's car, so what, that's not what I want. Oh please bring it back!  By the way, people around here love them and keep them forever."
"Best car I ever owned  I bought my FWD Jeep Cherokee Sport brand new in 1999.  I had it for five years, put 90k miles on it and  only did routine maintence.  This was an awesome vehicle and I hated to get rid of it.  The only down spots were hard plastic interior.  Otherwise, it was an awesome vehicle.  I'm still hoping to pick-up another one used sometime soon."
"Why did Jeep stop making these?  I bought my Jeep from the original owner in June of 2006, and I've been very happy since day 1. I bought it with 75k, and since then i've put 23K on it since. I've had to replace the orginal brakes on it (i'd suggest the ceramic brake pads), tires, and shocks, but that's been it. I also put a 2"" lift kit on it, because stock 4x4 vehicles tower over it. Now it's about the height of a stock 4-runner. The best thing is that it's never stranded me, it's been the best car I've owned and I've owned and sold a lot cars. "
"Nothing Can Replace It!  I have had my Jeep since my junior year of high school.  It got me to and from college countless times, three moves, and even an annual 1,000 mile round trip vacation.  This car has never broken down and I have never needed roadside assistance in the 8 years I have owned it. However, AC finked out at 90,000 and many minor repairs were also made, adding up quite a bit.  But I can't complain, this car is the epitome of reliable- snow storms, white outs, blinding rain? No problem, always has got me through! The design has no bells and whistles, mine doesn't even have cruise control, but thats's what makes this car fun!  It's a truck and meant to be simple."
"XJ = Quality  I have owned several Jeeps and have been pleased with the quality, dependability, simplicity and utility of every one. My 1999 Jeep XJ Cherokee is by far the best overall vehicle I have ever owned. I would recommend any year Cherokee - that has been well maintained - to anyone that needs a dependable utility vehicle at a reasonable price!"
nan
"Strong and Steady  I owned my Cherokee for 4 1/2 years. It was a great vehicle. The V6 is capable and the 4 wheel drive is awesome. The truck got me through any type of condition with no problems. Overall reliability was great. The only items that I replaced (outside of normal maintenance items like brakes and tires) were a steering linkage piece and a power window part. Other than that, the vehicle was free of problems. If they still made them I would buy another. Since they don't I bought the new Patriot which is the most similar thing Jeep now makes."
"Excellent all weather vehicle  This is my second Cherokee (the first was a 96), and I've really enjoyed the restyle (done in 97).  I get good fuel economy with the 5-speed manual, and the 4wd works well in the snow.  Never breaks, but when it does it's inexpensive to repair and easy to do-it-yourself.  An excellent all around SUV.  It isn't the newest design or the most stylish, but I think it's the best.  Jeep never should have killed it for the Liberty."
"Love it!  I got my Jeep new on my 16th birthday and still have it now. It has never left me stranded and is still running strong with just routine maintenance at a tad over 100,000 miles. It is a great suv to have for all occasions, such as out with clients, moving furniture or just around town doing errands. "
"Rugged  I always wanted a Jeep Cherokee growing up, finally got one and I've been loving it ever since! With two kids and a wife, this is a very comfortable ride on the 450 mile round trip to the in laws house we take about 4-5 times a year. Goes excellent in the snow and mud. At 100,250 miles, still going strong and haven't had any problems."
"hmmm...  I bought my Jeep with 66k miles on it. It is now 9 months later and I have put 3k miles on it. My Cherokee is a lemon! I purchased the extended warranty which would cover it fully until 2009 or 100k. I have had to bring it in to be serviced 6 times and only 2 were covered under warranty! Thankfully the REALLY expensive fixes were covered under warranty: driveshaft and transfer case cracking which would have set me back thousands of dollars. Three times the check engine light came on with the dealer telling me that the vapor canister was cracked, the gas tank was cracked, and some issue with my transmission. The other was when the crankshaft broke causing me to be stranded!"
"My Baby!  Owned it for several years now. Plain as they come. 4 cylinder. 5-speed. Manual windows (remember those?). Added factory AM-FM tape/CD and roof racks. 2.5"" lift is nice. K&N filter helped too. I've owned 5 other Jeeps with 4  cylinder and sticks; love em'. No rock climber but 4WD low is all I need for off roading anyway."
" A satisfied Jeep owner  I purchased my Jeep for three reasons: 1.  To be able to travel the roads during any weather conditions.  Except for icy conditions, nothing has stopped the Jeep. 2.  Towing:  I tow my 4000 pound boat/trailer without concern and do not worry about being able to get the boat back out of the water.  The Jeep brings the rig right up the steep, nasty public launch that I use.  The only problem here is that the weight of the boat tries to drag the Jeep down the ramp, even with brakes locked. 3.  Durability:  My family has owned numerous Jeeps and they have always served us well (except an early 1980's 2.8L Cherokee). This Jeep is the best I have owned so far, even with putting  15K/year on it."
"Dream come true  I bought this Jeep with 90k on it. I now have 125k just a year and a half later, I have had no mechanical problems whatsoever.  I have put a 4 inch lift and 33 inch tires on this Jeep and I am still happy about the gas mileage.  It takes me wherever I need to go.  The engine is very powerful, I can spin the tires whenever I want.  I've wanted a Jeep since I could remember and I don't plan on ever selling it.  If it gets totaled I plan on buying another one.  I love it and recommend it to anyone."
"1999 Jeep Cherokee Classic  The 1999 Jeep Cherokee Classic is a very utilitarian vehicle.  It is a bit loud on the road, does not have the best gas mileage, and the six cylinder engine is adequate.  That being said, there have been absolutely no major issues and the vehicle just keeps running."
"175k and still going strong...!  I purchased my '99 Cherokee Sport in July of 2005.  It had 166k on it when I bought it, and its now nearing 175k. Only things I've done to it is put a bigger set of tires on it and a serpentine belt.  After totaling a new TrailBlazer last February and getting into the Jeep, it is quite a bit smaller, but gets far better gas mileage.  Handling is way better then the TrailBlazer also.  I guess I lucked out when I found my black Cherokee. It has the 4.0L with the 5 speed, and it downright HAULS with the manual.  It's no nonsense exterior design makes this Jeep awesome in the woods.  VERY easy to maintain. Sure it's loud, not very comfortable, and somewhat small ... but hey it's a Jeep and that's what a Jeep is."

"Pure Jeep  If the interior was too small, why did you buy it? Cherokees were a low cost SUV that were passed by the modern minivan/""SUV"" that are being sold now.  It was one of the last real SUVs. SUVs were not nice to ride - they were utility vehicles.  That being said, my Cherokee does exactly what I need it to do. It rides nice, decent mileage, and can carry a few people.  Jeeps are easy and cheap to maintain. Use aftermarket replacement parts (there are A LOT of them out there) and you'll be happy with the Cherokee for quite some time.  If you want a cushy, roomy, nice riding car: buy a minivan. If you want an SUV: buy a Jeep (except the Liberty)."
"Fun Jeep -- Increasing Cost of Ownership  When a vehicle has 100,000 miles, I know we have a lot of work to do. This is no different. Tires, shocks, battery, brakes, etc. are normal. Electronics should be a bit more resilient. The air conditioning coolant has a leak. Of the 3 Chrysler vehicles I have owned, this seems to be their plan to encourage us to sell the vehicle; the system always fails around 90,000 miles and the transmission fails around 100,000-120,000. Planned obsolescence? Other makes seem to be more robust for this, but I digress. Other that that, a nice vehicle, fun to drive as an SUV."
"Great Small SUV!  I have a 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport. I bought it back in September of '04. I bought it with 55,000 miles on it, and it has 59,000 at the moment. I would suggest getting a high performance air filter and an inexpensive lift kit. I put a 2"" lift on mine and it really makes a difference, not only on the outside, but the ride quality is much better. I would definitely recommend this car, especially because of the cost of gas these days. I get about 18 miles per gallon, and where I live, I pay about $40 to fill it up. Also, the 4.0L 6 cylinder engine has a lot of power, especially when you add the air filter. When i bought it, it had about 190hp, now it's cranking out about 205hp."
"Repairs will come soon if you buy now  My experience with American vehicles tells me that they will begin need major repairs at or about 70,000 miles. My Jeep Cherokee is no different. I have 69,500 miles and will pickup my vehicle and its repair tab of about $1000 tomorrow. No repairs were due to negligence -- they were due to normal wear and tear (power steering, power window and front end). My last American vehicle was from the 1980's and my next probably won't be until the 2080's! Additionally, electrical features stink. I've have repetitive problems with a speaker wire crimping in the driver's side door and a repetitive yet intermittent problem with passenger side power window."
"Unstoppable  I bought my Cherokee from a salvage yard after it was hit on the front left wheel, ran into a pole or stoplight, and then flipped on its side.  After that much abuse, I didn't expect it to start, much less be drivable.  But amazingly, all it took was a new battery to get the Jeep started.  I had a mechanic shop replace most of the steering system (the impact to the wheel bent a few parts), and then I replaced the panels that were damaged. It's quite amazing that I could pull the Jeep's exterior apart using simple hand tools and I was even able to salvage some the bent pieces.  After repairing it, I never had any trouble. The engine will start in zero temperature and never causes problems."
"Not that great.....  For a Jeep I expected more.  This vehicle has been nothing but problems. Shocks every 30 thousand miles, $1500 for upper and lower ball joints, both front bearings/hubs replaced, passenger rear leaf spring replaced, both O2 sensors replaced, clunky drive line. Now at 107,000 miles, water pump may be going.  I think the most annoying thing to me is how the rear end sags because the leaf springs wear by design.  Luckily I had a extended warranty up to 75,000 miles otherwise I would have been really upset.  One thing that is good is that during the summer months I can get 20 mpg from the 190 hp inline six.  This is a poor product and Chrysler Jeep should be ashamed. "
"Love my Jeep  I love my Jeep! This is the best, most reliable, most fun vehicle I have ever had.  Even more fun than a BMW 320I (had one of those -- that's another story).  I have had this vehicle for 6 years; bought it new, never had a problem.  The only time it was in the shop was when I hit a deer and wanted to get the grill fixed.  Gas mileage is great for an SUV. I constantly go 320 miles or more on a tank.  If it's a road trip I've gotten as much as 450 miles a tank.  Not too bad!  Love the Cherokee, I wish they would not have discontinued it, the Liberty is too cutesy, not my style.  Great overall vehicle. "
"A Great Friend  I have had my 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport since brand new. I am very impressed with its reliability. Always starts and it never fails. It is fun to drive but a bit painful as you feel the road. The quality of the workmanship on this SUV is excellent. Impressive. My Jeep has 170,000 miles and it still feels good to drive. I am ready for a new car and the Jeep goes to my 16 year old daughter. I trust this small truck enough that I am giving it to my daughter. No complaints from me."
"it's ok - not great  I bought this car brand new in '99. Had to replace transfer case ($2500), window regulator, speaker and wiring, front brake calipers and a few days ago the thermostat plus all kinds of other small stuff. Maybe other cars are worse, but until now it drove fine but in the last few months I've had to spend a couple thousand dollars to keep it going. With 57,000 miles, I'm worried about the next 40,000. Maybe it's time to sell."
"Awesome Jeep  Very pleased with my '99 Jeep Cherokee Sport.  Agree with other reviewers: brakes grab when cold or wet, but quickly get back to normal.  A bit of a gas hog when in 4WD & with defrosters roaring, but all SUV's are.  6 cylinder straight 6 engine powerful and responsive.  Average 17-21 mpg.  No engine or drive train problems.  Replaced brake fluid lines once (housings just wore out).  Performed usual maintenance (tires, tune-up's, oil changes). 4WD easy to switch into and out of; good steering in 4WD, not like piloting a boat.  Have taken on long trips and use for my daily commute -- I love my Jeep!"
"Still fun to this day  After owning this for two and a half 
years, I still find myself excited to 
drive my Mustang.  It is a great car to 
cruise in or to take to the track.  It 
is an absolute joy to own."
"Solid  My wife and I have put 30,000 miles on it since we got it with 50,000 miles on it. Since then we had to replace the front rotors, driver's side power window motor and tires. The 4WD light does not display in the instrument cluster and sometimes (after a lot of rain) the cluster will not work for a few minutes. All in all we like it. The ride is stiff but tolerable. It is an absolute blast off road. It is also very good in the snow. We typically average about 20mpg."
"Solid Jeep  This SUV is an amazing vehicle. The only way I'm going to get rid of this thing is if I total it, which I don't plan on doing. This is a great drive, extremely capable, especially in snow, and is great to take offroad, and can make the transition back to pavement beautifully. "
"Seriously... my best friend in the world.   My Jeep is the first car I ever bought for over 2k. I've had it since 2001, and it has been the greatest car ever. I never want to get rid of it -- it's like family to me now. It has required little maintenance and has taken me all over the country. It's got about 82k on it, but drives and looks brand new. "
"jeep cherokee sport 4wd  I'm 6'1"", and wish it had more room inside the cockpit. I feel squeezed sometimes.  Fuel consumption is not real good with this SUV, but then again, are any of them.  Makes a great beach buggy for surf fishing. this is a great car for teens who are just getting started, low cost to maintain. Good vision all around.   "
Really Like It!!!  Bought used and have had for a little over a year.Have put over 26k on it and had no problems. Ride is good for a truck with 2 axles. 4wd is great and have never been stuck. I-6 is strong but thirsty.One note I have added K&N filter system and have noticed a big improvment with fuel economy. Town went from 17 to 19-20mpg. Highway went from 19-20 to 22-25mpg. Might want to consider adding one to yours. Back seat is small and I have to watch my head getting in. After a local hurricane drove through about 20 inches of water no problem.  No problem towing my boat. (1800lbs)
"Real Review of a 2000 Jeep Cherokee Sport  It's a love/hate relationship.  Granted, I bought it with 134K.  I've put 51K on it(185K).  The vehicle was trailed behind a RV every winter to FL.  Looks great.  I've owned it 5 years and it's a been a comical piece of garbage.  New head(of course for 00'), alternator, water pump, AC compressor, thermostat, radiator, cat. conv./O2 sensors, CV joints twice, sensors, electrical problems... it just goes on.  I'm not including wear items.  Never once taken off road.  I get that an old vehicle has problems.  I'm just mad at myself because a friend bought an out West Toyota 4Runner at the same time and it's light years ahead of Chrysler engineering.  I love it because I've done all the repairs myself.  I hate it because I can't trust it more than 100 miles from my house.   I have a 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited and it has has so many problems in 17K miles I can't believe it.  I'll buy a Toyota next.  Maybe someone has a good story.  I'm just tired of reading the same ones that tricked me into buying it.  Truth be told, I still own the YJ and will ruthlessly wheel the heck out of it until it dies..."
"The Jeep That Could  For the purpose of helping out others with an overview of the 2000 Jeep Cherokee, I would like to give my opinion on it. I originally bought the Cherokee for $2,500 in Arizona. Beforehand, I knew nothing about jeeps, much less offloading. The Cherokee originally had 97,000 miles with perfect condition interior. No dents on the sides, no mechanical issues. The Cherokee has powered windows and mirrors, as well as 4WD. With the SE edition, I did not have the regular gauges that other vehicles have. Even without these gauges, I have had no problems. The only major issue with my Cherokee, is the fact that the wheather strips seem to not work. Water constintly enters the vehicle from the top and side of the doors. Other than the weather strips failing, the jeep is a very reliable vehicle. I would recommend to any first-time offroaders, or those first time snow travelers. It does amazing!"
"2000 Jeep Cherokee (personal Tank)!  I've always loved the looks of the Jeep Cherokee. The styling is classic and still holds up today. The in line 4.0L 6 is the best , most bulletproof motor I've ever owned! I love it and I will never sell it!!! I had the fortune of getting one from an older couple who bought it brand new and always babied it. Too bad they don't make vehicles as reliable and easy to work on anymore. They must've realized they weren't making enough money on service after making these!!!! I have 218k miles &, still runs great!"
Love the XJ!!!  The old Cherokees are simple and reliable even when abused and neglected. They're also built like tanks. I survived without a scratch after flipping my '96 Cherokee on it's roof and I immediately bought a 2000 Cherokee Sport after that. I had the 2000 for about 7 years or so and even after neglecting to change the oil or keep up on maintenance I never had any serious problems. Looking back though I wish I would have treated it better and held onto it. I regretfully sold it and bought an '03  Ford Ranger(big mistake). Now I'm back to an 05 Grand Cherokee. I'll stick with what I know and love.
"Rugged, Reliable  I have owned this 2000 classic for 16 years. Tires and fluids are all it has needed and 1 power steering pump. 144000 miles of trouble free on and off road use. Carries more than an Wrangler and  can go the same places. Mileage averages 17 MPG on regular gas.  Winch, 3 inch lift, Rear axle locker, Took it to off road at  Telico, NC. no issues if you know how to drive. Best vehicle I have ever owned and I have had many over the years. Still it's my daily driver."
GREAT UN CAR  Tis my fourth Mustang convertible and 
"Love this thing  I love my jeep. It was the first vehicle I bought from a dealership. It had 90,000 on the clock now it's at near 200,000 I've been everywhere in it. Down in Kentucky all the way to California no issues. Parts are cheap and maintenance is easy. If you have a chance to get one that is really clean, get it."
"built strong  The engine is strong at 204,000 miles, but because of salt and New England winters, it is a good idea to replace rusted parts at this point."
"my awesome white cherokee sport  This jeep will last a long time if u take great care of it. .I got blk alloy rims with serious a/t tires. ...next will be a 3""lift. .."
"The Best SUV Ever  The original SUV was, and is the best. It's reasonably economical, quick and agile, and combines the ruggedness of a true truck frame with agility (the agility is helped by the aftermarket, stiffer shocks I installed along with slightly wider high-performance tires). And it can go pretty much anywhere.My 1998 Jeep Cherokee Classic 4.0 has more than 180,000 miles on it - yet when I change the oil after 4000 miles, the dipstick still shows full! I've never had an engine with this level of longevity. With its NP242 Selec-Trac transfer case, in addition to 2WD and 4WD Hi & Lo it also has Full Time All-Wheel Drive - in this mode on wet pavement it's like having an Audi Quattro or BMW X-Drive."
"Best Vehicle EVER!!!  I bought my 2000 Jeep Cherokee Sport 7 years ago and loved it!It took me everywhere and could do about anything.Ride was a bit rough, but that's a Jeep.Last month I was hit in the rear by an Expedition doing 60 mph.I made it through the accident with only a mild concussion, unfortunately, my Jeep did not make it.It was still going strong with 161,000 miles on it.I miss driving it everyday. I am now out looking for a new Jeep, but only go with used because I want the 4.0L I6 motor!!"
"forrest service ""Gump"" green  Got my cherokee @ govt. auction 2 years ago with 63000 miles ..Its the forrest service green an uglier colour than even shrek after a night of drinking..this does not distract from special forrest service options like steel gas tank skid plate and other skid plates protecting the underside..now my jeep has 67000 miles and real nice rimsit aint the workhorse in my fleet of cars..that is my 1992 cherokee also with the great straght 6 motor...the 2000 is my 5th jeep with the straight 6 and runs smoother stronger and faster than the others ever did. a truely rugged vehicle..buy one or two..YEA"
"I can't let her go 2000 jeep cherokee 4x4  I bought a newer F-150 so I no longer had a need for my jeep so i decieded to sell it.I washed it, waxed it, painted the mouldings and bumpers with bumper paint, touched up the finish coat, cleaned the rust off the steel rims, steam cleaned the interior.I've now decided to keep her and sell my truck.This has been the most reliable vehicle I've owned.After 7 years and 90K(bought it with 65K) I have had no major repairs.The only issues I've had is with the suspension but it's all maintenance items."
"Best Jeep ever  Bought new in 2000.Currently 175,000 miles and still going strong.Mine has the 5-speed manual mated to the 6-cylinder engine.Great combo for 4-wheel drive!Only major repair has been replacing the a/c compressor.Jeep has taken me all over the country.Interior design could be better, especially the back seat.Not too comfortable back there, but hey, it's a Jeep!Wish someone made a dependable, basic 4-wheel drive vehicle today.This one will stay with me until one of us dies!"
"Most Reliable Vehicle Ever Had  My husband and I have had this Jeep for 4 years.Had 70k when we bought it, now it has 130k.Low miles for a 11 year old car.We've had no major issues.Daytime running lights means you chance headlights often.Electrical sensor replaced under dash and a brake light sensor.Besides that just regualar maint.4.0L is best engine Jeep ever made. My dad has a 96 like ours with 280k and still no issues.We expect to get 300k out of her too.She's like a tank!Back seat a bit small for 6 footers but fine for short people/kids.Definately best buy for TMV. "
"You know you're getting there in a cherokee  I have had this vehicle for about 15,000 miles, and I have been very happy with it.It is as capable off road as off, and there are thousands of modifications for these vehicles.Whether you want to hit the trails or brave New England winters, these are some of the best vehicles for the money.The Cherokee is also one of the safest, toughest vehicles on the road."

"Great Car  This car is extreamly reliable. I turned over 128,000 miles with minimal troubles. Nothing costly has gone wrong with it, still on origional engine and tranny. Leaks less than 1/2 a quart of oil a month in its older age,started around 115,000 miles but nothing too costly."
Love my jeep  This is my 3rd one. I had a 1988 Comanche 4x4 then a 1996 Cherokee.  Now a 2000 classic. I love them. They're very reliable and fun to drive.
"Bulletproof- buy again in a heartbeat  First new in 2000-absolutely bulletproof.  Very practical w/ generous cargo space. tow hitch bike rack & ski roof rack. Easily handles class IV roads w/ plenty of gear, blasted through 1ft+ snow & rain deluges.  Pulled a few stumps out & a stuck car.  Fun at drive in with the hatch lid open to the screen.  Knuckleheads t-boned it from both sides of the front wheel wells, but kept rolling.  Reqd minor repair work, but takes a punch.  Decent mpg (~20 mpg) for utility.  Great acceleration.  Can be bumpy at times, but swallows potholes w/o problems.  No major problems beyond routine maintenance.  Quality keeps up against any other domestic or import. Jeep, why did you ever stop making these?"
"the best   i love it, she just dont quit she starts every day and run's great my wife own's one too and she love her's"
"Old Faithful  I got my Cherokee brand new in 2000, and upgraded to a Wrangler in 2008, 120K miles later.  I still have the old Jeep and use it for Home Depot runs and driving in the snow when my wife is using the Wrangler.  I beat the heck out of it in the first few years, and honestly didn't maintain it too well. But it's a workhorse; except for brakes, tires, fluids and filters, it still has 100% original parts, has never left me stranded and to this day the engine starts right up on the hottest and coldest days, and the drive train still performs like new.  Those I-6 engines have to be the best-built engines around -- I wish they still put them in the Wranglers."
"Love my Jeep  128,000 miles and still kicking.  I love my Jeep Cherokee.  I hang on to it because there is nothing out there I want to replace it with. It is the perfect size, great motor, great 4WD system w/ part time/ full time and a simple vehicle.  In deep mud and snow I still haven't gotten stuck. I wish Jeep would bring this one back into production.  Get back to basics!"
"ONE TUFF JEEP  I've owned my jeep for about 8 years.  I've had no major problems to deal with since. I've got mine hooked-up for off-road(4"" lift w/32's and some bolt-on engine mods) its literally a beast on wheels. I can get through anything I want. I pass 50k$ SUV's going up the slickest of roads on my ski trips. I highly recommend to any one looking for an affordable off road vehicle. Gas-mileage stinks--- 13mpg combined, but its been very good to me, plus its paid off... "
"Loved it up to the moment it got totaled  Love my Jeep.  Bought 2 in a row and love the first one as well.  Never a problem, you can't kill that 4.0 motor.  Wish they would bring it back.  Easy to drive on the long haul or around town. Towed my boat and camper across many states and loved every minute of it. The back seat legroom area was getting a little small for my 5-10 boys.  Other than that, we love the ole' jeep. It got totaled , I mean really totaled but, if it weren't for the Jeep, I may not have walked away from the accident."
"213,000 mi. and climbing  My 2000 Jeep Cherokee Classic has been the best vehicle I have ever owned.  I have owned 17 vehicles and none of them even come close.  The common problems associated with the Cherokees are present (front speakers quit working, A/C quit, hood latch rusted out), but other than that it has required almost no maintenance. "
"I love my jeep  I love this jeep, Ive had mine for almost 10 years now and its the best vehicle Ive ever owned.  It just a great all around little truck, it does it all from hauling 2X4s to plowing through snow to a drive to the market. Besides regular maintenance and a bad sensor many years ago Ive never put a dime into her. Starts every morning, never broke down on me. Ive driven the grand Cherokee and the difference is unbelievable, my jeep feels so much studier and gripped to the road. I can go on and on, there is a reason they made this style jeep for almost 30 years, its just that good."
"good and bad  This is the first car that I have bought 
and am more or less satisfied with 
what I have gotten. I think the exterior 
design is great and has not looked 
this good in years. On the other 
hand, the interior design is horrible 
and needs significant improvements 
and more aminities."
"I miss my Jeep  Toughest and most reliable vehicle I have ever owned, foreign or domestic.  Had to sell it at 150,000 miles so I could get my wife a new vehicle, but it was still going strong.  Tough, reliable and simple.  "
"good until 100K  I purchased my Jeep Cherokee 6 years ago with 73,000 miles on it. I loved the way I could go anywhere on/off road. I had no problems until she hit 100,000 miles. My A/C stopped working after many trips to the auto shop I gave up on having A/C. Then my heater quit working! I have gone through 2 rad.'s in 2 years, blew a head once and still to this day have no heat and A/C. I don't think my problems have anything to do with the build I, think whoever had her before me didn't take care of her. "
"AWESOME SUV  These jeeps are great for everything and any road condition. Not too big and not to small. Just the right amount of storage and room. My Jeep drives great, and it's fun. I would buy another one in a heartbeat. I wish they still made them."
"Tough Old Bird  Small enough to fit into any parking spot, yet big enough to tear up any trail. The Cherokee is tougher and more reliable than any vehicle I have owned. Looks good, drives even better."
"2000 Cherokee Classic in Chile  With my family we like to be able to leave the weekends, to be in contact with the nature, our Cherokee has occurred excellent experiences and we have been able to arrive with the practically to any place, it is comfortable, perhaps the consumption is high, but he has a very reliable and powerful motor.  And we feel very sure in the one it is a solid vehicle."
"Gonna Miss My Cherokee Sport  This is the best car I've ever had. I bought it 5 yrs ago with 55,000 miles. It was hit 3 times in the front & passenger area. It survived 2 fender benders and finally was struck by a deer a few days ago. The deer killed it. Insurance adjuster said the only reason its totaled is the high mileage, 169,000, made it less in value. Only repair was the oxygen sensor 3 yrs ago. I loved my Jeep, May it rest in peace. I truly will miss you. P.S. I'm shopping for another Jeep =0)      "
"2000 Jeep Cherokee  This is a great little run around vehicle.  Built like a tank. Almost 10 years old and we still can take it to the club without ""shame""  Seats fold down & we can haul a ton of stuff."
"Love  My dad bought this Jeep new in 2000, and loved it. After a few years, the poor baby had to sit for a while so he could drive something that got better gas mileage! I got this awesome vehicle on my birthday 2 years ago. I love it to death, it can do anything! Off road, on road, hauling stuff, this thing is a tank! I would never trade it unless it dies on me....hopefully never. 4LO is a ingenius invention, you never get stuck with that kicked in! And you can pretty much pull anyone and anything out from mud/snow, etc. Currently running with 99318 miles. New brakes after getting her running again after sitting, and new Firestone Destination All Terrrain tires."
"Great for a Jeep  I bought my previously leased Limited and have put about 60,000k on it since 2003. It's a very reliable car, but even fully loaded it's becoming a relic very quickly. I will probably run this thing to 300k just to see if I can(they say the I-6 is rated for 300k), but my wife just bought an '08 CR-V and she has about 50 more options on her vehicle than mine. Plus her v-4 engine feels more powerful than my I-6. I love the 4 wheel drive, it handles great in snow here in Colorado. The only problem is the back seat is not comfortable, and even fully loaded, there aren't a whole lot of amenities on this car. For a Cherokee though it's the best you can get, unless you want to pay 40k for a Grand. "
"Starting to dim at 90K  I have really been pleased with it. However, at 90K the rear differential has got noisy (an $1800. repair if you don't like noise). This Jeep eats brakes like french fries. I'm on my 5th set. The AC controls are breaking down also. I was hoping for 125K, before retiring it, but I'm wondering what's next. I paid 17K new. No absolute major repairs. "
"I have wanted a Mustang for 40 years.  I bought my car from an auction I work at ( Adesa Sacramento ) and I love it!! It is a v6 with an air aid cold air injector, throttle body spacer and a Flowmaster exhaust. The previous owner also added blacked out 17 inch factory rims. This beast will smoke any G6 or v6 camaro out there.... If you can buy a base model and do the bolt on stuff yourself do it!!!!"
Quality's not there  I love this car.  That's why it pains me to have to report this car's been in the shop almost a dozen times.  It was in for the rear clutch pack TSB 4 times!  The Shaker system ate several CD's.  It rattles.  It's hard to fuel at times. The A/C barely cools the interior.     I've had 10 year old Honda's that didn't exhibit 1/10th the problems this car's had.  This is the last Ford this former employee will ever buy. What a shame. 
Fun Fun Fun  Have had only a few problems with the 
"Off road Jeep that can handle the city   Ok to start off this is my second Jeep Cherokee as I hydolocked my last one, oops. I had to buy the Cherokee again as I am very impressed with its ability to handle difficult off-road situations without mechanical failure, a very reasuring feeling. The 6-cyl has the power on the road and on the trail. 4x4 is great in deep snow, sand and steep trail riding. I wish they would put the Cherokee back in production.  I modified my Jeep to include a snorkel for deep water protection and performance, pretty sweet mod. Added Grill guard, wrench, skid plates, lift kit, serious roof rack. Solar power to keep battery tip-top, Hella Fog lights, air compressor, in dash GPS, laptop mount I love my Jeep!"
"Great Jeep  I have a 2000 4dr 4x4 I bought used with 33,000 miles on it in 2003. This thing has been mechanically rock solid. It's getting older and my cruise control went out on me. But that is the only real problem I've had and I'm about ready to turn 90,000 miles of daily driver torture on this thing. Parts are super cheap and plentiful. Easy to work on. I still like driving this thing, and I look forward to snowy days. If I ever sell it I know I will miss it."
"Best Vehicle I've Ever Owned  This has been the best vehicle I've owned. Although it has been in the shop a few times (it's a Jeep) it's still going. It gets me where I need to go when and how I need to get there.  As a jeep that is stock, it outperforms some of its competitors in the off-roading department.  My brother also has one. He has a great photo of his jeep pulling a Ford 4x4 (with all the extra add-ons for four- wheeling) out of the mud.  If you're looking for an SUV that can haul, tow, drive through snow and mud w/o any difficulties, Jeep is the one!  One more thing.  When the back seat is folded flat, I can fit a dining room set with six chairs and the table. Tons of room!"
"Still going and going  This baby has never let me down. It even ran on little transmission fluid not once but twice. Two great stories. No major difficulties. I have kept the maintenance well and she has never let me down. Multiple trips from DC area to Buffalo in winter and no concerns. Great off road ability not like todays small SUV's (overgrown station wagons) A great reliable vehicle, I'm glad I get to keep it and am upset I have to get a commuter car to save on gas. New brakes at 52000 miles, now have over 117k and no problems, still has original shocks, which do need replaced by now. otherwise, it keeps going. wish new jeeps were this reliable bring back the 4.0 or the equivalent diesel."
"Built like they used to  Bought it 2 years old with 55K on it, and now have 125K. I've had no major problems, but have also performed more than regular maintenance on it. Little problems include speaker wires in the joint of the front doors breaking, has happened numerous times, and the drivers window lockout switch going bad, keeps the other switches from working when they should be. I've towed over 5K lbs a number of times, and have taken it off road several times as well and it keeps running strong!! Gas mileage is a little meak at 15 city and 20 highway, but I've noticed that Royal Purple oil inceases it considerably."
"Why did they stop making it?  Bought this Jeep when my wife was pregnant with our first child.  Wanted a safe and reliable vehicle.  I got what we paid for and more.  My wife loved it.  It has been a workhorse for the last six years and now that I have finally got it as my primary vehicle, plan on keeping it for many more years to come.  In fact, when it came time to get a bigger vehicle (interior) to accommodate the growing family, we stayed in the Jeep family and got a Commander."
"Sweet Machine  This is my 1st Jeep. I absolutely love this vehicle. My friends and I have taken this jeep many many places. From Maryland (my home state) to Fairbanks, Alaska to Tijuana, Mexico. Since those road trips I have put an 8 inch lift with 35x13.50x16 Pro Comp M/T tires on American Racing rims and many extra mods. 4.0 MPI still performs flawlessly after 87,000miles, tranny and transfer case rock solid with Command Trac 4x4 system. I have taken this XJ to Moab and may other places, slammed it up against many other machines never a disappointment.I  recently talked my Honda driving wife into an old CJ-7 purchase; she was reluctant at first till she heard that ol' 350 purring under the hood. Keep Jeepin."
"Good hunting rig  My XJ has been a good hunting vehicle.  With a minor lift and larger tires, It can go through just about anything.  It sucks the gas and isn't the best for larger people to be in but it has a lot of cargo area compared to the TJ's."
"Could not be better!   Bought new in '00, this thing has needed NOTHING! I don't count wear items such as brakes, tires, batteries, etc. like many reviewers do. I decided to write a review because it just turned 200,000 miles today. No leaks, no burning oil, runs the same as new. The 4.0 is astounding. If you use a K&N air filter and Mobil 1 10w-30 synthetic oil, it'll get about 28 MPG on the highway. That's at 75 MPH with 3 people and luggage using 87 octane (regular) fuel! The ride is much improved with the Dunlop RVXT 235 75 15 tires instead of the horrible stock Goodyears. The last set of Dunlops went over 60K with even wear. I have ALL the power options and ALL work with no problems. It'll do about anything!"
"Cherokee the 1  This is a very reliable vehicle. Only complaint I have is a noisy exhaust because of vibration from hardened rubber rings in between pipes. It doesn't ride like a Caddy but if you really need to get there it will take you there though sunshine pouring in the moonroof or plowing though a foot of snow! No breakdown or problems yet as of 85,000 miles."

"JEEP The High Price of Low Quality  I bought my Jeep used, paid book for it. Beautiful exterior/interior fully loaded minus sunroof. The following is a list of noted discrepancies or issues I've had by order of occurrence. 1. Garage door programmable buttons - are for looks only, at least mine can't be programmed.  2. The fuel gauge works from 3/4 tank and below only, when I fill it up, once the gauge hits 3/4 it immediately drops to Empty (the fuel light comes on too)  3. Rotors, pads, alternator (all replaced, and all expensive compared to other makes/models)  4. Replaced CAM SHAFT position sensor (idled rough, and kept jolting and dying)  5. ABS/Brake lights came on, Speedo went crazy, the engine died. It's still broke. SIGH"
"GREAT JEEP  I've had my Jeep a little over a year now and it has been an excellent vehicle. It's got great styling and great reliability. I've only had to change the tires, oil and wiper blades since Ive had it. If youre looking for a reliable great looking SUV buy a Jeep Cherokee"
"two years - still goes!  In the two years I have owned my Cherokee, I've logged 20k on a Jeep i bought with 33k. This Jeep has been a workhorse if I've ever seen one. Yeah, a few small issues have popped up; oil pressure gauge, new shocks, tires, and the usual maintenance -- but aside from that, this truck keeps going. I'm averaging 19 mpg with a combination of 75% highway and 25% city. I needed a reliable vehicle that would endure the beating that roads around the NYC area would throw at it. The Jeep fit the bill. It's great in the snow, the A/C handles the heat well, and long trips with my Cherokee are a pleasure"
"Great Ride!  I've had my Cherokee for almost 2 years and have not had a problem with it. I bought mine used with 34K and now have almost 70K and it runs like a charm. Within a year I had to put new tires and shocks. Aside from that, I have not had any issues. Its fast, handles rather well, gets prety good gas milage and isj ust a workhorse."
"No leg room in back  Adults will find their knees pressed against the back of the front seat, even shorties like me (5'3""). The front seat does not move back very far and my 6' brother felt cramped in it and his head brushed the headliner.  The back seats are VERY difficult for an adult to get out of due to the very small door opening.  Not the right car for anyone with any type of leg or knee restriction or injury."
"MY RED BABY!  I love this JEEP. Have owned it for going on 5 years now. Bought it with 27k miles on it, and have never ONCE not ONCE had it in the shop. It is built to drive. It is built for hauling (hauled my bass boat with it), and it is built to last. We have to sell it soon to accommodate our growing family, and I am just bummed that Jeep has decided not to make the Cherokee Classic style anymore. If you get a chance to buy one - DO IT!"
"A Real SUV...  This is my first Jeep and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one. The 4.0L is a torque monster that pulls better than any other compact SUV I've ever driven.  The Command-Trac 4wd system works flawlessly and allows this Jeep to go almost anywhere.  Snow isn't a problem, just point where you want to go and hit the gas.  I'm 6'4"" and drive in a very upright position and I've got enough headroom so that I'm not ducking while I drive.  As far as brakes go I personally haven't had any problems with them at all.  There are a couple of real minor flaws inside.  The transfer case lever does vibrate as does the exhaust system but these are minor flaws. Overall the Cherokee is a real SUV not a cute-ute."
"Great SUV for the money  This is the first Jeep I have ever owned and I plan on keeping it for a long time. It has plenty of power to pull my boat around through the hills and the gas mileage is a respectable 20 MPG on the interstate. I am 6 foot tall and the seat and ride are very comfortable compared to some other SUV's I've been in. This is a good driving 4X4 for the money, too bad they quit making them."
"Great Jeep  Have had my Jeep for 10,000 miles so far. So far It has just needed routine oil changes, a battery, and some tires for the winter. Very reliable and dependable vehicle. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable SUV. It gets decent fuel economy; probably get around 320 miles on a tank of gas."
"Why did Jeep Discontinue the Cherokee?  I bought my Jeep in 2003 as a used vehicle. It had 75,000 miles on it which is a lot for only being 3 years old. Since I've had it nothing major has gone wrong  with the exception of the right front brake caliper locking against the rotor. Everything that has gone wrong with it before that happened when it was still under warranty."

"I love my Jeep!  I bought my Cherokee used with 25,000 
miles on it and have had no problems. I 
put around 90 miles on it per day so it 
gets a lot of use. It is extremely 
reliable and fun to drive, not too big 
& not too small."
"bestjeep  What a great Jeep! More than I ever 
expected. I wish I could buy nather 
one just like it brand new. Never had 
it in the shop for a repair. Other 
than 4 wheel drive all the time, no 
complaints."
"Takes a licking and keeps on ticking  Had her for 2 years.  Picked it up used with 
27K.  Have only had 1 major repair bill for 
major 4WD repairs, something about 
induction.  The car has pick-up on the 
highway (up to 85/90 mph).  Took it up to 
Vermont all winter to hit the mountains, I 
only had trouble on ice/snow once or twice 
during a white out.  I love it.   Reliable to the 
bone."
"Jeep 6 month review  Had a 94' Mustang and wanted an 
opposite vehicle to compare it with.  
This is it, exactly;  with the 
exception of power being  comprable 
(the jeep feels as fast as the v6 
mustang) and 
them consuming about the same amount 
of gas (18-20MPG).  I can help my 
friends move, tow small loads, 
pass on the grass, take all the 
short cuts I can find, not 
slow down to 1MPH everytime I see a 
bump, and park where ever I please.  
Try doing that in a 2door sports car 
with z-rated tires.  This is not your 
typical SUV, this is not a living room 
on wheels.  It is similar in size to 
an Escape or CRV and remains true to 
its herratage of off-road capable 
vehicles."
"ndiw  didn't like it until I start driving 
it. It's very stable and powerful. 
Driving it gives me a lot of 
confidence, it feels like the 
strongest flexible car to drive"
"Excellent buy  I am glad I got this jeep. Its a 4D,2W
drive, just needed it for regular use in
city. After 4 years, Still Gives 22 m/g
on highways. Very confortable to drive.
Haven`t spent a $ for repairs yet,
except regular oil change & maintenance.
Drive one to have fun, a classic."

"Rotors, A/C and Noises  The rotor/pads for the front disk 
breaks suck! My first replacements 
were at 23k! I had to call 
Daimler/Chrysler in Detroit to get 
them replaced ""under warranty"". Though 
I finally had them replaced at 23k; 
they'd been bad since 16.5k! Did I 
mention that the brakes were shot 
again at 42k? The A/C compressor has 
also gone out twice and, let's not 
forget all of the ""cold interior"" 
noises that I've been living with. I

the drive shaft fall out at a

"Someone convince Jeep to Bring it Back!  This was my first and only Jeep. 
Although it was a lease, I did go off 
road a few times and was greatly 
impressed of it's abilities. Besides 
being reliable to and from work (a 
blast in the Mich. Winters), I also 
used it to lug around a fairly large 
drum set. The ""Fern Green"" never 
became a boring color either. Over-
all, this was the best vehicle I've

"My Tow vehicle  I originally purchased this vehicle as a
tow vehicle behind my motorhome.  During
the past year I have towed it from
Florida to California and back.  Of
course it does not ride like a big
sedan, but it sure is handy for
exploring the various areas when we are
camping. Mine is a four cylinder model
with a standard transmission.  Have had
no problems.  It is very dependable and
easy to drive and park."
"Great engine and transmission but rest sucks  I bought my 1997 Jeep Laredo 4 Dr Cherokee used in 2010 for $3400 with a busted odometer showing about 75,000 miles.  Now it is Feb. 2018 and the odometer shows over 100k (it is underrecording mileage, but does work).  I am retired and am the only driver, and drive it mainly 3-5 times a week for local meetings, with the longest trip being perhaps 60 miles.  It still has the original shocks, 6-cylinder engine and automatic trans.  The engine and trans still run well, but everything else goes to hell and it is only 20 years old and not abused. I had to have the starter replaced and it cost over $500.  Compare that to my 1965 Mustang where many more parts still work vs this Jeep.  The speakers go in and out - not sure if they are stock. The headliner has fallen out, so I had to pull it all out after trying to glue it back up.  The 4WD didn't shift right in 4WD after I got it, so I have been afraid to use it since then.  This Jeep didn't have a tow bar, so I installed one and was surprised it cost over $400.   Then Jeep had a recall due to gas tank safety, and the fix was to install factory tow hitches, but I already had one.  The dark green paint clear coat has ""crizzled"" so it is flat (it does sit outside).  The rear two door electric windows failed soon after I got it, and it cost me $400 to fix that.  The mechanic said Jeep cheaped out on the switches so they always fail.  The horn has failed, and apparently it is because the switch is in the steering wheel airbag, and you have to replace the costly air bag to just ensure the horn works.  The dome lights go in and out.  The return spring and bushing in the driver door hinge has fallen apart, so the door squeeks each time it is opened. It is on a welded fixture, so can't easily be replaced.  The left rear door window just fell out of the track and down into the door.  I finally had to just wedge it to stay up and had to disable that switch I had put in earlier.  The driver seat material has failed and ripped.  I hit a truck with a trailer hitch at about 5 mph and the entire front plastic bumper fell off.  Had to re-attach it with screws.  The bumper ""black"" finish has gone ugly flat.  Apparently, like the paint, it wasn't designed to last past 15 years.   I recently had to tow the vehicle becuase a fuse blew, and found there was absolutely NO tow hook or place under the front of the vehicle. So I hooked the chain to a steering bar for a short 8 block tow and bent the rod, costing $600 to fix.  So, I will continue driving this until the engine or trans fail then junk it.  I will never buy a Jeep again because their quality control and longevity of many lesser parts and electrical systems suck.  They are great to drive in the heavy Florida rains, but not that great to put up with bad quality in a lot of small things.  Before buying a Jeep or any other vehicle, be sure to check for Federal government recalls to know what they are."
Own a Jeep !  Very very good car
Great Jeep  
"Endless reliability internally, falling apart externally  I've had my cherokee for roughly 4 years now, bought it used at 120,000 miles, and I have yet to even touch the motor in terms of repairs.  It is a modern day sherman tank mechanically.  I've obviously had to replace my share of wear and tear parts such as the alternator, tie rods, brakes, etc.  But never anything on the motor, or even the transmission for that matter.  Unfortunately, as with all cars, it is falling apart at the seams in terms of appearance.  The bumper fell off the other day for no reason, and it has a crackle when idling (most likely the catalytic converter).  Its a pretty big gas guzzler as well.  All around I'd say it is the perfect ""point A to point B"" vehicle."
"Love my Cherokee  Absolutely love my Jeep Cherokee. It has 230k miles on it and no serious mechanical issues. The automatic transmission is fantastic (AW4). I used to hate Jeeps, but after having this thing I want to buy more and more. It isnt the most comfortable SUV, but if you're looking for a reliable, good looking Jeep then look no further. The 4.0L is notoriously reliable. I have a 2006 Commander with 100k miles and my 230k Cherokee gives me less problems. When things do go wrong, parts are cheap and with an afternoon pretty much anything can be fixed. If you can find one in the South you dont have to worry about rust. I will never get rid of my Cherokee, maybe just buy more. My favorite Jeep every made"
"I LOVE THIS THING!  I'm completely in love with my cherokee. I have over 260k miles on it, all ive really had to do is preventative care and regular maintance. Its one of the best values I've ever seen. I wish I would of bought two. It is without a doubt one of the best daily drivers out there."
"OIIIIO thrills  I have a 93 indestructible Cherokee. I just bought this 97 Cherokee, with 245K miles on it. Paid $1500 for him. My 93 is a standard this 97 is an automatic. IF you can find one get one. I easily expect to get 300 K out of this Jeep. I have 2 new cars a 4runner and a Pontiac, but would rather drive my 97 Jeep any day than these due to the fact ""he"" is solid as a rock. If the powers that be ever read these blogs , they would re invent these Jeeps, and would have a new following, I love mine and dread the day (if ever) I get rid of it."
"Love it, can't find anything better  I have owned this Jeep for 11 yrs.  No other vehicle I have had will cruise at 80 on the interstate, then take the extreme trails in the OHV park like they were nothing. I bought a Mini Cooper and it's a good thing I kept the Jeep-way more dependable and a lot cheaper to fix than the Mini.  I've hauled building materials, pulled out chain-link fencing and stumps, still on the original clutch at 126,000 miles.  It has never left me on the side of the road or refused to start.  All I have had to do is routine maintenance, lube oil and filter, brakes (once), and a water pump.  I've decided to put some money into paint and new carpet etc. and just keep driving it."
"Good Jeep!  My Jeep was given to me for my 17th birthday present, I like it a whole lot, accept for the low gas mileage, and the rough ride. My o2 sensors went out and I needed a new caddy converter. One more thing is my seats are beginning to squeak a lot but other than those its a fun car! "

"The Jeep Thing  I bought it in 2008 and has 112k miles and i`m tge 2nd owner,never used 4 off- road,4.0,4x4,5 speed(oh yeah i want to change gear when i want to),MPG- 19 city,24 highway at 70 mph,20 towing a u- haul tralier.Never had any major repairs i replaced the shocks,breaks,all fluids,wiper blades,installed a cd player and also new speakers with amp all on weekends...grab a beer and save money doing that 4 fun.Easy to work on,fun to drive,to park,lot of space inside,best suv for the money.If u want to save money on gas ride a bicycle...want a smooth ride buy a BMW,but the JEEP is the way to go everywhere."
"Like the Energizer bunny, it keeps going  Always wanted a Cherokee since high school and it came true about 7 years ago. Bought it with 60,000, in RED no less and with the 4.0. Picked a 2wd (less weight/better fuel econ). Repairs have been few: water pump;radiator;gas pump;starter. Take good care of it and it will last forever!"
"war wagon  Purchased jeep when I joined the army.  I really didn't care for it at first but figured I needed a 4x4 for the colorado winters, after I really abused it off road over and over again I fell in love with it now I will never get rid of it. I have put 180,000 hard miles on it with no major repairs.  I actually feel bad for the way I treated it because it never let me down.  Has good power and great 4x4 going places where my buddies lifted trucks cant or end up high centered.  Still cant figure out why they ended it.  Not very smart."
"Loved mine!  I bought my jeep back in 2002 with 90k miles ALREADY on it! I just got rid of it at 205k miles to get a new Jeep Patriot 4x4. Awesome transition. I loved my Jeep, super dependable, great 4x4 performance, perfect cargo space, etc. Had to deal with water pumps, radiators, catalytic converters, and all other wear and tear of the car, but it lasted me 205k miles and it is STILL running strong. Go get one with low miles if you can find one"
"Great Vehicle!!  156K+ miles and she is solid and strong.  I am very pleased with the reliability of this truck (former honda, vw, nissan driver), and try to maintian the basic services, oil changes, ect.  20.5mpg +/- 0.7 on 87 Octane.  One minor problem with the wiring rubbing under the Power Distribution box, which affected the aux electric cooling fan, but following a $100 repair, she has required no other expenses.  Strong recommendation as a sturdy no frills vehicle. Driven every day in AZ heat 110+ with no overheating."
"Second one...  97 Cherokee with 154k. Rebuilt the cooling system last year at 145k, the first time it was touched. Virtually indestructible, it's done everything asked of it. It's a Jeep..not quiet..not smooth..just good road manners & traction to spare. We always keep a Jeep around for deep snows and the 97 is far better than the 95 we had before. If you need a pack mule to pull or haul & get decent mileage, consider a Cherokee."
"1997 - a Good Year  I bought my 1997 Jeep Cherokee new in 1997.  It has a straight six engine, manual transmission - no frills.  What a workhorse - It has well over 200,000 miles and all it has ever needed were oil changes, tires and windshield wipers.  It doesn't get any better than this.  When the engine goes I may get it rebuilt since the straight six is easy to rebuild."
"Good  I bought this Jeep ""on impulse"" because I needed something to drive. The 4.0l engine is incredible at 285k miles and I haven't put any work into it. Does great off road and I drive the hell out of it. Real steal and I look forward to driving it for a while! "
Bring The Jeep back  I bought my Jeep with 13900 miles and have been working it. From road trips to upstate New York to towing car/trucks. It has never left me stranded no matter what breaks. I could not have asked for a more dependable vehicle. At 171000 miles and a beating that would tear most trucks in half its time to let her go. 
"Wish they still made them  I love the look of this model. Very rugged and simple. Nowadays, SUVs have been designed for soccer moms and this thing actually looks like it was designed for a little more than picking up some milk. I bought my Cherokee used last year as a second vehicle for winter use and have invested some money into the suspension. It has 140,000 km on it and the engine/transmission and 4WD all run like a charm. The only problem I have is the computer acting up during the cold months of winter, but has no problems in summer. Gas mileage is not the best and rides a little rough overall. I know it wasn't meant to be a smooth riding gas sipper, but it is a little harsher than you'd expect."

"I Used To Love It!  It was 3 years old when we purchased it.  I have loved my jeep for many years but 3 years ago (100,000 miles) we had a problem with it continually overheating.  That led to a new engine, new radiator, etc.  Also, have had to have 2 window motors replaced, tranny lines replaced and thankfully (sort of) before the 3 yr/36000 mile warranty on the new engine expired it cracked the head.  That was replaced and now it is again overheating. I've had it!"
"Jeep  Love this baby! Can't seem to want to trade it in. I have put 170,000 on it. Very minor problems such as water pump,starter, and oxygen sensor. Other than that, oil, gas and tires. It gets the gas mileage that it should get for a 4.0 engine. People who complain need a smaller car not a SUV! This baby is fast too. "
"Good Vehicle  I've 237,000 plus miles on this vehicle. Major repairs include clutch replacement (twice), fuel pump, radiator, water pump, air conditioning (freezes up intermittently, still does), and I've replaced the battery  harness once. Despite these repairs, it's been a great utility truck for driving on construction job sites. I love power of base inline 6 engine.  I've gotten consistently 23 mpg. average city/hwy. If Jeep makes this vehicle again, I would buy another one.  It's a classic.  "
"My 2nd Jeep  Got 225,000 miles on my 1992 Jeep and needed a replacement - this was as close as I got - its already done 97,000 miles - I like this basic Jeep, its a no-nonsense SUV.  The wife and I find the seats realy comfy, and now we have cupholders and remote heated mirrors. Also like the factory tow package and 2"" receiver. We use this Jeep in the snow, in the city, and in the desert and high-Sierras back- country"
"1997 Cherokee Sport  Very fun all around vehicle. In town its the perfect little grocery getter. Turns sharper than my Accord. Also great acceleration. Up in the high country it has been very good offroad in place most other suvs can't go. What I have replaced so far is the radiator and TPS sensor but that has just been in the last 5,000 or so miles and it is at 157,000 right now. It has been good to me for the last 10 years and I hope to keep it for another 10.    "
"Cherokee's are not real Jeeps?  I loved my Cherokee of course it stunk on gas, but what did you expect?  It's 4.0 w/ 8.25 rear axle, awd transmission, you know what that means?  As close to flawless as Jeep or any other car company is going to get.  It was perfect in size. The only real flaw was it had leaf springs. If you add a lift be prepared for a bad ride."
"Beware  My Jeep has had nothing but problems. Radiator cracked, windows leak, doesn't start most of the time. I have replaced many sensors, hoses, and more. Has had about $4,000 put into it and still doesn't run well. Hasn't held up like I expected. Has a little over 100,000 miles. "
"Voted 4x4 of the year for a reason  My 1997 Cherokee has been the most fun to drive vehicle I have owned, it has 160,000 miles,  runs perfectly and gets 20 MPG. I would recommend to anyone who isn't scared of a solid axle ride, and someone who doesn't care about useless interior gadgets to get a Cherokee, you won't be disappointed if you take care of it."
"A true SUV  I purchased my Jeep Cherokee sport a year ago and I love it. Despite getting bad gas mileage (16 mpg city), I realize that this is an SUV, so it's understandable. The only complaint I have is that the engine is extremely loud and roaring. Otherwise, it's a very sturdy car. It accelerates well, has great steering, has comfortable front seats, and pretty good road traction. The real fun begins when you go off road, though. This is not an SUV for someone who really needs a station wagon (aka Ford Explorers, Expeditions). The ride on rocky ground with bumps is surprisingly smooth. This is a classic, REAL SUV that will remain a favorite of mine. And, what's cooler than having a JEEP?"
"best bet in class  I drive my 97 Cherokee Country pretty hard.  Never had any issues; gas mileage isn't great but I knew that when I decided to get an SUV.  This thing accelerates great out of the gate, is comfortable on the highway and is unstoppable off-road.  I challenge anyone to get this thing stuck."

"Don't buy this thing  I drove this car/truck twice a week.  I had only 62k on it and here's what went wrong: water pump, fuel pump (3 times), belt, alternator, radiator, oh and the engine (head gasket and bearings).  Each of these problems happened with about a month of each other.  Cons: When it didn't break down it rode very rough, like a truck.  It was noisy and the gas mileage could be 20 mpg if you were going 55 and had no wind.  If you drive normally (70mph), then gas mileage dips down to about 15mpg.  Doesn't have a split rear seat.  The engineering is horrible.  Pros: Climbs hills pretty good.  Is good in the snow, if you have good tires  I hated this POS, you will too."
"There is nothing like a Jeep  First, I am seeing a lot of reviews 
that are using gas mileage as a 
negative.  I get 17mpg in the city and 
21+ on the highway and thats with the 
4.0L straight 6.  It's a SUV...thats 
great!!  Unstoppable off-road.  
Backseat slightly uncomfortable, but 
just fine for short trips.  If want to 
drive a legend...get a Jeep."
"Still good for the money  The negatives first:  
- noisy
- poor ride
- horrible gas quality
 Positives:
- excellent, bare bones, interior design
- superb off-road performance
- superb winter (snow & ice) performance
- 112,500 miles and still no major 
repairs"
"I love my Jeep  The Jeep has been dependable, reliable 
and a great fun to drive. I have 
enjoyed my Jeep and very sad to let it 
go. I wish these vehicles were still in 
production. If so, I would have bought 
another just like it. The engine light 
came off and on, but you learn this was 
just a malfuction and nothing 
mechanically wrong. My wife never like 
the ride, but she just could not 
appreciate it."
97 Cherokee  I took care of it and it's been great.

in snow and rain.  I've had few 
problems with it, but few too many to 
ignore.  Radiator had to be replaced 
due to the seam splitting, gas tank 
sensor had to be replaced, and now my 
rear hazard signals go on when I put my

"Jeep Cherokee Country  One of the best cars I've owned.  A 
little wind noise that I would prefer 
to not have.  At 153,000 miles, it's 
worth far more to me than the trade in 
value offered."
"Great!  Its a great vehicle...It rides so smooth
on the freeway. I used to own a 94
Blazer, and it just would shake and
rattle around. Whole new story here!
Very smooth -- and even more powerful.
Great stuff! "
"Very Nice Older SUV  This is a great vehicle! I have had it 
for about 4 months now and I love it. 
I have never had a SUV so this is my 
first and I love this compact SUV. It 
has quiet a bit of power for a SUV. 
When I bought it, it came with 31 x 
10.50 tires. So the gas mileage is 
right at 17mpg. But I like the big 
tires when I am four wheelin. This SUV 
is truely a Jeep, it does go just 
about anywhere! It is a very capable 
four wheel drive vehicle!"
"Only in a Jeep  My '97 cherokee Sport has 119,000k and 
still running. Not as peppy around town 
as the older models. Great stock off-
road capability. I have a few problems 
like a cracked exhaust manifold,and a 
vacuum leak. I only get 14 miles per 
gallon. I have plans to trade it in for 
a 1996. "
"Hunk of Junk  Almost the day the warranty ran out, 
this hunk of junk has been nothing but 
a headache.  I bought this jalopy new 
and in the last year have had to have 
the tranny rebuilt, a new water pump, a 
new power steering pump, a new 
radiator, and now the evaporator needs 
replaced.  Enough already!  I am buying 
a 4Runner."
"outstanding vehicle  this is the best car i have ever owned! 
Within the last 12 months I have driven 
in a blizzard (One of only two cars 
that was able to get around), driven 
through a desert, driven from sea level 
to 14,000 feet high and not one 
problem. the jeep heats up quickly in 
cold weather, the ac works wonders in 
hot temps and its roomy enough to carry 
a family around town if you wanted it 
too."
"I got one of those lemons  I bought this car to be an occasional driver - I have only put 13,000 miles on it in 3 years. Here is a list of things replaced on warranty and mileage when replaced:  Differential - 500 miles Radiator fan - 1800 miles Door jamb switch - 1900 miles A/C compressor - 2900 miles Fuel pump - 6100 miles A/C high pressure switch - 7800 miles Alternator - 9200 miles A/C line - 10400 miles A/C recharged - 12700 miles  The warranty has just expired and guess what? A/C not working again. For some unknown reason this vehicle does not want to have working A/C. Very frustrating. After my experience with this car I understand why the big 3 are in financial dire straits. Very shoddy workmanship IMO."
nan
"It was my dream car, but....  After two years, the 
Jeep reputation reared its ugly head.  
The AC is continually broken.  The cd 
player and sunroof are dead. The roof 
lining is sagging, the windows leak.  
It rattles and chirps (and not only off-
road). The automatic transmission has 
very bad days.  The side bumper strips 
are falling off. And, mysteriously, the 
front driver's side door has begun to 
rub against the nose-side panel, slowly 
denting it inward. I adore it...but 
will soon face the fact that 
I'm pouring money into a bottomless 
pit.  (sigh....)"
"Fun on the road  The Jeep Cherokee combines a very 
functional SUV with an attractive car. 
It's simple styling is timeless. 
Durability is outstanding with the 
truck suspension(not a fluff SUV 
wannabee). The ground clearance is 
great.  So far, I've had no problems 
with the Cherokee and use it for 
everyday driving and hauling an 18"" 
pleasure boat."
"Jeepers--no creepers  Good value.   Reliable.  Excllent off-
road.  4.0 liter is plenty of power, 
even if towing a camper.  Heater is 
great--quick to heat up.  Best 4X 
around for my money.  Full size spare 
is a necessity if going off road.  A 
great family car."
"Do you like buying car parts ?  If the weather gets too hot you have to replace the battery.  When it rains you  have to replace the coil pack.   I have yet to see whats going to happen when it snows or if I have to drive in extreme cold.  If you like to replace car parts based on weather conditions then this is the car for you.   Also the salesman was very disappointed when I elected not to buy warranty .  I am wondering now is it because he know this car has issues.    Not only that I am harassed  daily by people selling vehicle warranty , I block the phone number they call from a different number  they too know this car has issues and I will need them soon.  This car may last one more year when the last payment is made and I can guarantee you that I will never by another Jeep ."
Great SUV  Fuel economy could be better and a Jeep should come with skid plates and recovery points standard. Other than those issues it's a great SUV.
"MPG Performance is a Scam  Beautifully designed car, but JEEP has a very long way to go with their engines. We fell in love with the JEEP Cherokee 75th Anniversary edition and decided to buy the car back in February 2017. After owning it for 2 months, it was instant regret. Instead of averaging an mpg of 27 miles, we can barely get it to do 17-18 miles (and that’s driving it as gently as possible). Please don’t make the mistake we’ve made, and save yourself the aggregation. I am already looking to trade-in or sell the car, for a more fuel efficient. Completely unacceptable for a company that has been built if SUVs for nearly a century. There should be a class action law suit for Jeep’s deceptive MPG score-card on the window sticker of their vehicles."
"Sweet spot  This vehicle is solid built and priced well. With this jeep, im not worried if i can get places when the weather is rough or just bad in general. I dont even have a top of the trim package and it has shown that it can take on most of what i throw at it. Snow nasty thunderstorm downpours and road debris is no problem. Light off roading doesnt even phase it like SUVs.  Is this vehicle in the non-trailhawk trim going to take you on extreme trails-probably not. But it provides you the piece of mind that when other SUVs cant make it this vehicle will.      Oh, my kids just love this Jeep also. Plenty of room to bring there toys and toys and toys and toys. Its quite enough that they can fall asleep even on bumpy roads to. For adults we have all our grownup toys(electronics) built in with the 840 radio system and instruments cluster..or use the power/hook up options they have in pretty handy locations"
"Firmwear update?! WHAAaa?  and engine mounts?  OK, let me start by saying. I have a 17 jeep cherrokee. its black on black on black. V6 (3.2 L) I bought this new from the dealer. I have just over 20k on it now. About 2 months ago my wife comes too me and says the check engine light is on. So i take it to the auto shop down the road and get the code read for me. Its a master Clutch sensor problem. Now I when't to the dealer to have them look at the jeep. (they didn't know I already knew what the code was) I was educated about a new firmwear update. for the computer on the jeep. witch tells the trans when to shift. I havent had any problems with the shifting since the new update. And the dealership was fast and freindly. Now... the engine mounts... This is a problem that is just starting to develope. when i shift into reverse i hear a pop and the same going into drive. I belive it to be the engine mounts. Going to the dealership this week to have it looked at. im still under warrenty. Other than that. Great SUV. lots of pep. and rides really nice. Dont care for the headlights. there great on a flat road. but if up hit a hill they cut off about 20ft in front of you. Its hard to explain. you would have to drive on at night to see what i mean."
"2017 JEEP CHEROKEE LATITUDE 4X4 WITH V-6  have the v-6, which is not an option when doing this review for some reason. I love this SUV. Handles great, gets awesome mpg's especially for a mid-sized 4x4 SUV with a v-6. I don't care for the transmission though at take off from a stop. And I don't care for the engine automaticly shutting off everytime I stop. I know I can turn that function off, but I have to turn it off everytime I get in the SUV and I usually forget until it has already shut off on me, I should be able to shut that feature off perminently if I want."
"2017 Jeep Lattitude several issues  I bought my 2017 Jeep lattitude 6-cyl in May 2017 brand new. In the past 3 weeks with 9,186 miles on the vehicle I have 4 problems that need repair. #1 chipping paint #2Front struts need replaced. #3 Shifter needs replaced #4 Heater blower"

"Excellent Vehicle  Latitude 6cyl  4x4 . July 2018  stand by my earlier comments. Dec 2017 Outstanding comfort for travel commute. My only problem will be the Dealer an I advised Jeep. My comparison covers most of the brand names including many size segments, I have averaged one new vehicle a year for the past 20 years between family an work, cheap to expensive.  We shall see how this handles the long term over the next couple years.   As of today, OUTSTANDING."
"Not entirely pleased  I've had my Cherokee for a little over a year now, almost 16,000 miles on it. Overall, it does great. Headlights are great, steering is great. Most of my driving is highway so I get around 26 mpg. What isn't so great is the electronics. Within a month of having it, the screen would randomly turn off by itself. Couldn't replicate the issue with the dealer. Stopped once the weather warmed up, did it a couple more times once winter hit again. I really dislike the automatic stop when you're idling. I've gotten into the habit of turning it off as soon as I start up, but I had several close calls because of it. The vehicle is so quiet, if you have music or passengers you don't always notice it's turned off. Until you go to pull into moving traffic and it does a weird idle jerking motion as it tries to start back up and you have to slam on the brakes to keep from getting plowed into. Fun. Can't turn the radio off so you have to mute it every time you get into the car. And it does NOT do well in snow. If you're on a straight, snowy road it does ok. If you have a steep, slushy driveway it does not. I've gotten snowed in twice this winter. The 4 wheel drive doesn't engage until your tires are already spinning and you can't engage it yourself. Good pavement princess, I'd say. Not so good at the ""sport"" part. And sitting in it for more than 30 minutes or so hurts my butt and back. Can't adjust the head rest so if my hair is up too high, I end up looking down at an uncomfortable angle."
"Off road beast / tows like a truck  I love my trailhawk, it goes everywhere I point it safely and securely. The ride is firm however it is a off road package. I use it to tow my pontoon boat, rzr and even towed my dirt bike from Tennessee to California no issues. The newest transmission update the dealer has done made my jeep shift like a dream. I love the 9 speed at 85mph it hits 9th and fuel mileage jumps to 25mpg and she rolls happily down the road. In the Smokey mountains last week I was comfortable enough to head out through Martha Sundquist park alone in the snow covering almost 100 miles on dirt, mud and water crossings while listening to my xm radio. My last vehicle was a 2016 Ram 3500 dually my trailhawk makes me smile every time I drive it."
"CAN YOU BUY IT BACK!  I wish I would've done my homework more on this unit... horrible gas mileage, not very roomy, no zip, did I mention horrible on gas mileage, no CD, can't turn the radio off only mute( who does that?) so every time I start the car the radio comes on even if I don't want to hear it. Very rough ride.. I feel like I'm in a army Jeep from the 60's."
"Uncomfortable  I bought in July 2017 so that I  had something my father could get in and out of easily.  This is the roughest riding vehicle I have ever owned. It's noisy and uncomfortable. I absolutely hate it. Regret buying.  If I could get rid of, I would tomorrow."
"Stay Away!  Since purchasing the vehicle in September 2016, it was seen in the service department in October 2016 for a loud click from the brake (told this is normal) and the vehicle shutting off during idle twice. An update was done but the issue continued. November 2016, I brought the vehicle in because the back seat would move back and forth if someone was not sitting in it (they had to replace the whole back seat) but as I was driving into the service doors the vehicle skipped and tried to die with lights flashing on the dash. Service could not duplicate. December 2016 brought in because the vehicle kept skipping when trying to take off from a stop. On two occasions it completely stalled but service was unable to duplicate. The vehicle also had issues with shifting too early at times and then shifting was delayed other times. Once again issue could not be duplicated. Later in December I brought it back again and was told there was a fix. January 2017 the vehicle was brought back again due to stalling and the multiair actuator was replaced. The issue continued as the service manager searched for an answer until I had enough in October 2017 when it came to a stop for no reason and the vehicle would make a terrible noise in reverse at times. Service along with FCA attempted to fix it but could not duplicate the issue. When I received the vehicle back it now skips in idle, makes a lawn mower sound in idle and when shutting off make a whining noise. I have stopped driving the vehicle and am trying to get FCA to do the right thing via Georgia's Lemon Law. I have done my due diligence following FCAs required steps and they said they cannot duplicate my issue but would give me a good faith payment for my time. I have asked to talk to supervisors etc. but am told that is not their protocol. This vehicle is unsafe and should not be allowed on the road!  I have video of the issues and one of the service agents commented on it having delayed shifting but FCA closed my case and said it is fixed, regardless of the fact you cannot fix an issue that cannot be duplicated. I sent my Lemon Law paperwork over 1 week ago certified mail and now USPS want to send it back because FCA hasn’t come to pick it up. I will not drive my children around in the vehicle and I will never buy another Chrysler product. I love my dealership but FCA has no business making cars."
Buyer be aware  Check the shifting.
"Well, let me say this about that ...  Finally had to retire my 17 year old (207k miles) much loved Ford Explorer. Picked a new  Jeep Cherokee with a 6-cyl upgrade mostly due to the fact that the new Explorers are butt-ugly and another $10k in price. I really like the look of the Cherokee over the other comparable SUVs and the price is the most reasonable considering purchase as well as future repairs. Plus a Jeep is well, a Jeep! I needed a reliable, well-rated 6-cyl, 4wd SUV with the ability to tow a 2-horse trailer locally, and I knew a Jeep would fit the bill. Sooo ... the good news - it's cute and sporty and really comfy to ride in, the technology is useful as well as fun and it rides like a car - pretty quiet. Haven't had occasion to tow anything yet but not expecting to find any problems there. The gas mileage is great - have been getting 20-21mpg just short trip driving around town so mechanically I'm pretty happy with it. But then the cons - basically the car seems to have been designed for a 6'+ man. I'm 5'5"" but can't see the end of the hood while I'm driving which is a bit uncomfortable - it would really be nice to know where it is, especially to keep from running into the car in front of me when parking at the local Walmart. The visibility trying to see out the back is REALLY awful for a SUV. The headrests are too tall (and uncomfortable) for a woman and block your sight when you try to turn your head to see out to back up, while the passenger seat headrest blocks a large expanse of the right side windows that the wide posts aren't already blocking. Backing up is a REALLY scary trick because there are so many blind spots you just have to pray you're not getting ready to run into or over anything (guess that's why they want you to pay extra for a back camera - no thank you). Headlights are pretty small and wimpy too and no fog lights. The back of the car is designed smaller than the front so that makes it seem even more closed in coupled with the poor window visibility. All that combined with the minimal cargo space with the back seats up REALLY makes me miss my Explorer!  And there's no automatic on/off headlights?!! What's up with that????? Again - 17 year old Explorer had on/off headlights?? What idiot thought that was a great way to save money?? This is almost the thing I dislike the most (other than the multiple blind spots) and it might have been a deal breaker if I'd realized it before I bought it. The drivers seat is too low even on the highest setting and if you don't have long legs you are practically against the steering wheel to drive (even at 5'5""). Explorer had moveable steering wheel which helped with this.  It's also a little tight and awkward trying to get out of driver's seat (probably due to having to be so close up to reach the pedals). Do I have buyer's remorse - yeah maybe a little. Maybe I should have done more homework as I just decided I wanted a Jeep and bought it.  But then again maybe all the new cars are like this one. I do have confidence in the Jeep product and don't have any doubt I bought a good solid car that will serve me well. Would I buy it again - just not so confident about that,  will have to take a closer look at a new Explorer."
"Snow birden.  i purchased my 2017 Jeep Cherokee on Memorial day of this year.  It is a Latitude with the V6 , 9 speed auto and all wheel drive-select one. I recently drove from Minnesota to Phoenix, a distance of 1800 miles and was pleasantly surprised at my gas mileage. My highway speeds were generally between 60-80 mph. On I90 in South Dakota my mileage dropped from 30 to 24.9 due to stiff crosswinds. When I turned south, the crosswinds became tailwinds and the mileage went back up to 30 as I arrived at Ogallala, Nebraska. It stayed relatively steady thru Colorado Springs and all the way to Gallup, New Mexico. As I approached Flagstaff, it had dropped to 28, but then the ride down the mountain to Phoenix bumped it back up to 31.4. The seats are comfortable, and the vehicle was quiet, except for varying tire noise on different pavement. The nav system worked well, although since it was just installed, the updates should have been more recent. They weren't.  I maintained speeds at or near the legal limit. Overall, I would give this suv a 4. I also carried a full load of cargo. On combined trips, 80/20, highway/city, the mileage was between 25 and 28."
"alscheroV6  This is a great SUV that is price right in the middle of the larger and smaller SUV, i.e Jeep Grand Cherokee and Jeep Compass. If you are looking for a leap forward in power get the V6 rated at 271 HP compared to the 4 cylinder at 184 HP. A big plus is that you do not loose much in mileage. Over all the fit and finish is great and I have had no problems thus far. My vehicle: 2017 Cherokee 4X4 Latitude with the 8.4 Uconnect system and the 3.2 V6 engine."
Great Car!  This has been a great car for the two 
"Only a Jeep will do.  My wife drove a Jeep for years before totaling it an accident.  We tried a Ford Focus (Titanium Ed.) but too many recalls soured us on it.  After 20 months we traded for a 2017 Jeep Latitude, and we she couldn't be happier.  I like that they decided to have some fun with Jeeps since our last 2004 model.  We have found a Sasquatch, and several Jeep or Jeep Logos hidden throughout the vehicle. It may seem a small thing but I like the fact they're embracing the brand, the customers, and having some fun along the way."
"2017 Jeep Cherokee  This is the second Cherokee thst we have owned the frist being 2014, the only difference is that we opted for the V6 this time the 4 cly. seem to lack power when you needed it climbing mountian passes getting on the freeway passing other cars, we figured that the extra power would be a trade for an more economical vehicle but sofar we are pleased with the 2i to 30 miles per gallon that we are getting on the highway, as for ride interior comfort electronics we were pleased with the 2014 and sofar I see no difference between the two cars, I do think that the 2017 seems to have more interior room but thats just my imagination. In short we were pleased with the 2014, and we are just as happy with our new one, time will tell."
"Tornado Rated! Literally!  There are reasons I checked and rated this Jeep perfect. This is not a soccer mom SUV, not a shopping mall vehicle! It's a great long distance driving SUV. 6000+ miles in 3 months. On 6/12/17, after pulling out of Lusk Wyoming. Around 1630 a tornado had literally dropped down on us - well traveling at 35 mph, our Jeep was hit by hail, rain so hard it sounded like someone pounding all over the Jeep. The Jeep shook violently as the massive amount of water and rain blew vertically from left to right. I accelerated as much as possible fighting to keep the Jeep on the road. 30 terrorizing minutes later. We pulled to the side of the road. I got to assess all the damaged that it surly had taken. Surprised and dumbfounded, Not a dent. Perfectly intact.  Just extremely clean! I trust the vehicle with my life. Again. Tornado Rated."
"Had it 11 months and 7700 miles... so far... great  We have the 17 latitude with the V6,,,, it didn't show it,,, but thats what we have... We paid $22,700.00 for it with the V6. Just got back from a 2500 mile vacation... 34 MPG average for a V6 with almost 300 HP.... Pretty good I think,,,, The 9 speed tranny is without fault,,, matter of fact... Perfect. This Jeep is the most quiet car I have ever had. I change the Oil at 3700 miles,, didn't hafta,,,, but I did. We bought the lifetime Bumper to Bumper warranty... It cost $2700.00 (Retail was $4300.00),,, but I think its worth if. I cannot say enough about this car so far.... My wife loves it,, we also have a 2014 Maxima,,, we like this Jeep better. Ours is Red,, with the Black Cloth interior... I may shouda bought one with leather interior.... but the fabric interior is great,, comfortable,,,, and gets going on long trips Bearable (Really enjoyable)... On trips we get great Gas Mileage.... I feel this Jeep is great value,,,,, and so far at 7700 miles not one problem at all. Update: have it over a year now, and 12,000 miles...... Great car, and we trust it  .  Great to drive, and comfortable. Not one problem...."
"Impressive features and handling  After test driving a 2017 Jeep Cherokee Latitude 4x4 with a 3.2L V6 9-speed automatic last month, I purchased one this past week to celebrate my 50th birthday. After buying my new Jeep I promptly drove it home from a dealer 250 miles away, and left on a 600 mile round trip vacation with my family.  I was thrilled to get 30 mpg when most of my driving was freeway at 70-75 mph, and happy with the 25 or so in town.  This was better than the 4-cylinder 2014 Toyota RAV4 AWD I recently sold, and the Jeep is much more comfortable! I chose the Jeep because I could get a tow package capable of towing 4500 pounds with the V6 engine, and still get an amazingly luxurious smaller SUV for a great price. I actually paid $10,300 under MSRP for a Latitude with the Comfort and Convenience (power liftgate), Cold Weather Package (heated seats and steering wheel), Comfort and Audio (power seat with lumbar adjustment and a 9 speaker audio system with a subwoofer), tonneau cargo cover,  the V6 3.2L engine upgrade, and the tow package. I didn't want leather (the True North Edition has it) and found it was very tough to find a Latitude with both the tow and the power liftgate, so when I found one I was very interested.  The dealer discount, factory incentives, Chrysler financing incentive and a USAA bonus incentive gave me a great deal and I'm very happy with my first-ever new vehicle and Jeep product!   It's comfortable to drive, handles well, has a quiet cabin, lots of cubbies to store things (my favorite is hidden under the passenger seat), feels luxurious inside and out, and yet still has lots of off-road 'truck' capabilities at the right price.  I've owned SUVs by GMC and Toyota, but this Made in the USA (mine was made in Illinois) vehicle is much more impressive in terms of performance and style.  I look forward to putting my roof rack and rear cargo basket on it and seeing where the roads (paved and dirt) take me!"
"Fast not so Quiet Cherokee Limited V6  I had a 2015 Mazda CX5 that I liked, but the road noise was out of control. I am an outside salesman so I go through cars very quickly as you can see. The CX5 had all the bells and whistles, but I didn't like some of them so I'm glad I had more options with the Cherokee. The first thing I noticed when I looked at the car is the design is fantastic. It looks like a Grand Cherokee, but more compact.  It is just the right size for me. When I opened the door the huge display screen was a sight to be seen. It has many more options than the CX 5 did on the display, which is a nice addition. Now lets get into the driving. It is a little quieter compared to the other compact SUV. If you want the same quality of sound and drive you will easily be spending over 45K with other similar models. It is fast with the V6 and honestly, who wants a 4 when you can get over 100 more horsepower for almost the same price and identical gas mileage? Here are the cons: It doesn't handle as well with corners as the CX5, the engine is loaded when you gun it (I actually like that about it but some might not), cargo space is a little smaller. I wanted a quieter ride but I'm no where near satisfied yet. I'll keep it for 4 years than see where Jeep is at."
"Wife's Dream Vehicle  If you want a quiet easy to drive SUV this is the one.  We have had this Jeep for  three months.  We use it for shorter trips of 60 miles or less.  We get up to 40 mpg on the 6 cyl engine.  The transmission is smooth shifting.  This was a concern on earlier models, but since the 2016 this has not been an issue.  We had the front struts replaced under warranty because they were noisy.  Now they are fine.  We enjoy the sure-footed handling and the many features like adaptive cruise control, parking sensors and rear vision camera, rain sensitive wipers,  radio that uses usb thumb drives, and SD cards for music.   We enjoy all of the features that are on this limited model.  We use our 2014 Town & Country Touring L for longer trips because it has more room and a longer wheelbase and do not need a quick turning sporty handling vehicle."
"2017 4WD 6 cyl  The Latitude with Attitude  The Latitude is a very good car.  Our last car was a Chevy Tahoe 4wd and it was a good car and still in great condition for a 2004.  I take very good care of my cars that is why they last so long.  This one so far is very comfortable for my wife and myself.  It is quiet and although it has a lot of fancy goodies; I love it and am getting used to using the back up camera which if fabulous, and for 75 a great addition for my safety and anyone or anything that goes behind me.  I am getting very good gas milage 25 plus and expect to get the full 30+ as the engine gets broken in.  It has a lot of room for us and our dog and for with the seats folded down has a lot of room to haul garden stuff and wood from the store. Our dog already knows how to get from the back seats to the front so she can find the most comfortable place to ride.  The 4 cyl engine is ok, but we thought the 6 cyl was better and the milage and power are are much better(esp. when using 4wd) The Tahoe was an 8 cyl and the 6 cyl latitude is just as peppy and the milage is so much better. If you need a great car(and by the way my wife picked out this car) get a 2017 Latitude; you will love it just as much as we do."
"GREAT SMALL SUV, WE LOVE OUR CHEROKEE!  We love with our Jeep Cherokee and very happy with it. The Cherokee rides very nice, handles well and is very sure footed.  The leather seats of our North edition Cherokee are very comfortable and it has a very roomy interior.  I am pleasantly surprised with the power level of the 4 cylinder engine, don't get me wrong it will not win any races, but the 4 cylinder engine in combination with the 9 speed automatic transmission does a good job.  The transmission does a good job matching the correct gear with acceleration and road speeds, while keeping the engine speeds low when possible and appropriate to save gas.  I was reluctant to buy the 4 cylinder version at 1st, but since I was not too crazy about the idea the start stop feature of the 6 cylinder engine, I keep my cars a long time, the car I traded, in, that I bought new was 23 years old and the idea of the engine shutting off on every stop and restarting when accelerating again was asking for trouble down the line.  So I decided to go with the 4 cylinder engine, that does NOT have the start stop feature on the Cherokee, I am glad we went with the 4 cylinder engine.  My wife has wanted a Jeep Cherokee for years and I am glad we finally were able to buy a brand new Jeep Cherokee.  I am also glad that Jeep builds the Jeep Cherokee in Ohio with a high U.S parts content. Thank you Chrysler for making such a great small SUV, we could not be happier with our 2017 Jeep Cherokee, North Edition 4 X4.Update regarding our 2017 Jeep Cherokee after owning our Cherokee for 10 months now is that we still are very happy with our Cherokee and have not had any issues with it at all. We love our Cherokee!"
"6 cyl Latatude  Having done some research prior to making this purchase, I didn't waste my time even looking at the 4 cylinder model.  The 3.2 6 cylinder does a very nice job with excellent acceleration and a very smooth feel.  It is a bit hesitant to down shift in response to increased throttle; if you want the sportier feel you can set the 4 wheel drive to ""sport"" mode and the transmission response feels much quicker.  The sport mode does cause a hit to fuel economy so there is a trade off.  I've been getting right around 25 mpg for mostly highway (probably 70/30) driving in the standard setting which I feel is quite reasonable.   As I'm older (65) the ability to easily get in and out of the car was important to me and as one would expect with an SUV, it is quite comfortable to enter.  The seats are comfortable as well and the power adjustment along with adjustable steering column provides for very comfortable seating.  That being said, leather would have been a nice option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Of the other vehicles I looked at the Chevy Equinox came closest.  The Jeep won out with a more substantial feel, was better equipped for the price, and the jeep dealer was much more willing to discount the price; the discount for the Jeep was about $4500 while the Chevy dealer seemed to hit a hard stop at about $2300.                                  I'm sure there are other small SUVs that might be better choices depending on the buyers requirements, but given my need for towing capability as well as basic transportation, the Jeep really seemed the right choice and after 2 months I've found no reason to believe otherwise.   As things are right now, I'd make the same buying decision and would recommend the Cherokee to family or friends.Up date at 8 months and 6000 miles.The gas mileage has settled in to about 23 mpg as I've stopped trying to keep it up and become a bit more heavy footed.  Still very happy with the car.  It has been completely trouble free to this point (as would be expected for a new car in this day and age).  I've had reason to use the heated seats and, unlike other cars I've owned, the heated seat can be set to two levels and the lower is quite comfortable with the high setting being a bit on the overkill side.  The heated steering wheel, while not dual level causes a temperature rise that is quite comfortable.  The performance continues to impress."

Economical SUV  I went on a 600 mile round trip and got 35 miles per gallon!  Bluetooth and backup camera are wonderful.
"it's a JEEP with luxury and sophistication !  it's a great vehicle over all ! worth the money, but make sure you seriously consider the V-6 ! The 4 cylinder lacks bite, and will leave you disappointed. I have the 2.4 cylinder right now and am truly wishing I had the six as the four seriously is sluggish and unresponsive. Not sure what JEEP was thinking putting this engine in a Cherokee...I will say If acceleration isn't that important to you then the four will be fine for you. It does it's job, but for me not impressed ! I enjoy driving it as it's seats are comfortable and the ride is smooth for the most part. Have 10,000 miles on mine now and have no problems and changed the oil once. The 8.4 Connect is user friendly and easy to use, the auto climate dual climate control is nice and works well and maintains a comfortable cabin. Gas mileage is average for a SUV I guess, but not bad. I do love my JEPP and am not disappointed in it thus far. But, because of the engine I am trying to turn it in early as it is a lease to upgrade to a Trailhawk with the V-6 or get in a grand Cherokee if possible ! Stay away from the 4 cylinder if possible.....other then that I am not disappointed in the JEEP Cherokee, great SUV and is stylish, comfortable, and you will have a sense of pride driving your JEEP around !"
"Mopeds pass me  Bought and sold 5 weeks later with 1000 miles. Could not get use to the extremely underpowered and unresponsive drive. the complex 9 sp trans bogs down the 1.4 L engine, not a good marriage. The JEEP Cherokee 4x2 was boring, slow, doggish and loves the 1200 - 1700 rpm range. FIAT WILL RUIN JEEP! Do not buy this vehicle, its slower than a moped. Plus, 30 MPG Hwy....my butt...27 avg."
"new jeep overland  I just purchased this vehicle 2 weeks ago so several of my ratings are NA so far-- like maintenance and resale value.  I traded my BMW, so just to let you know the differences, the jeep overland 6 cyl, has much more technology, and the interior is much nicer than my BMW, as is the sunroof and front and backseat comfort.  The acceleration on the jeep and the road holding are not as good as BMW, but that would be as expected.  Overall, I am very happy with the jeep, and hope to keep it many years.  The only reason I was looking to trade is that I put about 24000 miles/year on my vehicle (so no lease) , and the BMW maintenance and repair cost after warranty is very expensive.  I was ready after 2 BMWs to find an American made smaller SUV."
Love my little Jeep  I purchased my Cherokee sport with the Altitude package and I am really pleased with it..I have heard about the 2.4 liter 4 cyclinder engine been sluggish but personally I am surprised on how peppy the engine is and responsive the transmission is also.i have nothing praise for this vehicle and for the price it's a great value..
"What a beauty!  Love this car.  First car with all the electronics.  So easy to make a phone call and send a text (voice activated).  Car is extremely comfortable, very smooth ride.  Smart looking interior.  Extremely pleased with this choice."
"Crappy Craftsmanship  Being in the military with limited income keeps my options low in regards to what I can afford for car payments.  I just got married and my wife just found a job in the Seattle area so we needed a 2nd car.  After looking at used vehicles, we came across Jeep's President's Day sale and they were offering $5K rebates for downpayment plus discounting the sticker price for all basic Cherokee Sport models. So we were actually paying less than what we were looking at for used Cherokees.  I wasn't impressed with the acceleration but it is a 4 cyl. My wife liked the features and it was new! So we pulled the trigger. 500 miles into the car, we realized there was puddling water at driver and passenger sides.  It was storming so I asked if her door was shut.  It was.  We drove it back to our dealer who proceeded to hold onto it for over a week.  Not once did they contact us.  We had to initiate the discussion and they seemed upset that we were upset.  A response of ""that's why there's a warranty"" doesn't comfort a consumer when the cause was a body part that needed to be welded shut, seals in the door and windshield that needed to be replaced/resealed.  It simply shows shoddy workmanship and low grade parts quality."
"Great sales person  Nice car, Great salesperson"
"After checking out all options  We went to the Detroit Auto Show and checked out all the SUV's at the show plus the new Pacific.  We narrowed down our options to the Cherokee, the Ford Escape and the Buick Enclave.  We went to a Ford dealership, Chrysler and Buick.   We could not get a car in our price range to buy at all at the Buick dealer, we could not get a 6 cylinder in a Ford Escape unless we waited 6-8 weeks.  At the end we got the Jeep Cherokee because they had a 6 cylinder loaded with sun roof, and a lot of upgrades for less the 35,000.00.  If you have not priced cars in the last 8-10 years you will have sticker shock."
Still at the trailhead for the Trailhawk  Too early to tell with just 347 miles. So far it's great. The 4 cyl tigershark is fine.

Good small SUV that offers 6 cylinder  I Love my 2017 Jeep Cherokee EXCEPT when you reverse and put back in drive the car stalls and then accelerates quickly which can be scary when reversing out of a parking spot. I also noticed that its acceleration is very strange...if you are going 30 mph and want to accelerate it takes you down to 20 mph before accelerating.. makes you feel like the car is going to just stop before acceleration. Other then that the car is great but i honestly feel like that is a huge negative when the main purpose of me choosing this car was for the speed of the 6cyl engine.

"Cherokee tops Honda CRV ..USA,USA, USA  I just purchased a 2017 Cherokee Latitude a few weeks ago, and  continue to be impressed.  To put it in perspective, I also have a 2016 Honda CRV and can make a good comparison now.  I had shopped both cars and negotiated rock bottom deals on both.  The sticker price of the Jeep was $36K but with big rebates to be had the price of both cars ended up within $100 of each other, or $27.5K out the door going with their mid level trim; Latitude for the Jeep and EX for the CRV.  But compare what I got in terms of value:  Power: the 6 cylinder engine of the Jeep is is much more powerful and smooth than the 4 cylinder in the Honda..a 90 hp difference..advantage Jeep.  Convenience: The Jeep has Power tailgate, Much better/larger LCD Infotainment System, Remote Start, More Adjustable and comfortable power front seats Auto Mirror, integrated 911 system etc not on the CRV. The CRV came with heated seats and the blind spot camera, both nice things but not of the value of the Jeep.  Utility: The Jeep came with Roof Rails, Tow package (can tow 4500 lbs!), and full size spare.  Honda did not include roof rails at that price point or tow hitch, and can tow only 1500 lbs if so configured.  Advantage Jeep.  Design: The Jeep has a unique outdoorsey presence about it, with off color stitching.  The Honda is a good design, but more boring. The Jeep has a full panoramic sunroof, while the Honda just has a small standard one.   4WD: The Jeep has adjustable settings of the drive system, not to mention higher ground clearance and approach angles.  While not a Trailhawk, the Jeep Latitude wins vs the CRV re offroad capabilities.  Ride Quality: This is a big factor.:The Jeep is as smooth as can be; The Honda is great compared to other small SUV's and has an impressive CVT transmission but compared to the Jeep ride quality is not as good and does not feel as substantial.  Especially on long highway trips, the Jeep with the V6 is just a better place to be and feels like a luxury car.  In fairness the CRV scores some points with more cargo room, better mpg, and the blind spot camera.      So in terms of Value, the Jeep is the clear winner and would even be worth the sticker price.   In terms of reliability, I guess that is TBD, but the Jeep seems impressively solid and unstressed.  If that is a big concern, Jeep offers an  insane Lifetime/Unlimited Miles Warranty Upgrade  for $2-3K.     Being an import car buyer since 1982 ( my CRV was assembled in Canada), I am now changing my perception.  Honda and CRV are always rated at the top of pack, and there are some outdated perceptions out there that imports are somehow better.  Jeep Cherokee has one of the highest US contents of any vehicle.  It is great to support fellow hard working Americans who make a product that is world class.    USA, USA, USA!!"
"Mange another Half million miles?  Unreal. Simply unreal. Owned since June 1998 and with nearly half million trouble free miles of hard Chicago winners and hot summers it's hard to stomach buying anything else because nothing will top this reliability or prowess in harsh winter weather. I can't even stomach looking at whatever these new ""jeeps"" are....maybe I'll just grab another straight six Cherokee!"
"Are you a man or not?  After getting in a head on collision with a suburban, where all air bags for both cars deployed.  The jeeps frame may have been slightly damaged, but I was perfect without a scratch.  Only going 30mph the jeep actually pushed the front end of the suburban, aiming it into the other side of the road where it should have been in the first place.  Insurance gave me $500 more than my original jeep was worth, which had 130,000 miles on it.  I did not hesitate and found another cherokee with a 4.0L inline 6 engine, 4 doors, and 4 wheel drive.  When you step on the gas peddle you feel the power, it's nothing like the V-6 engines out today.  It may only get about 13 miles per gallon, but it's well worth it.  Mainly, if you're a car guy or someday want to be, this is the car for you.  Knowing simply how to use tools, I've fixed most issues myself, learning a lot about how cars work in the process.  The overall build of the jeep is very simple; with any issue it simply takes a youtube search and a replacement part."
"Just kept going and going  I owned the 1998 Jeep Cherokee 4.0L engine, 2WD, auto trans, base model no electric power options. It served it's purpose well. I could load a lot of stuff into this vehicle as the backseat would flip forward and down and made a lot of room in the back. The full size spare tire was side mounted inside the rear cargo area and it really didn't take much room so it was okay. The Jeep had nice acceleration with the 4.0L engine, and fuel economy was pretty good too. I drove mine with respect and it rarely gave me trouble. I put some moderate all terrain tires on it and the Cherokee performed great in winter while I spent time in Northern New York dealing with the lake effect snow that was pretty bad.  Now the bad......The check engine light would come on intermittently. This caused somewhat of a problem during my yearly smog test I had to have done in California. I got lucky a few times and it went off so I immediately would drive into the nearest place doing smog tests and would knock out my annual test. Soon thereafter it would come back on. When this first happened the dealer in Huntington Beach, CA told me it was a sensor in the transmission they had seen it many times and nothing was wrong with the transmission just the stupid sensor, and to just try and deal with it. They said the transmission on these Jeeps were the best they ever saw, but the sensor in my model was a stupid tiny little part that did nothing. Otherwise a repair was going to cost a lot to drop the transmission and replace the sensor located above it. So I just dealt with it. Another thing that happened, probably associated with that sensor was the electronic gauges would just fail.  All the warning lights on the gauge cluster would light up, then go off, and the odometer would stop clocking miles. I have to admit the non functioning odometer was awesome because the Jeep remained a low mileage vehicle for almost the entirety of my ownership. Sometimes it would work, and most times it did not. I attached an old school GPS with velcro to my steering column to see how fast I was going.  I parked the jeep for many years while I was overseas and upon returning the a/c failed, the power steering failed, all the attachments to the engine failed and would throw a belt if I drove too much. I felt guilty about trying to sell it to a private party but instead went into a Chrysler dealership one day after the check engine light went off and looked at a used vehicle (not a Chrysler product but a low mileage Japanese model) on their lot. They kept trying to bring my Jeep into the deal and wasted my time all damn day with nonsense offers for warranties, upgrades, etc and I held firm and got a great deal on the used truck they were selling. They kept asking over and over if I wanted to trade in my Jeep but I kept telling them no it was the best car I ever owned and wanted to keep it forever which was total bull but they bought it and made a great offer for a trade in on it and reduced the selling price on the other truck I was looking at. They never even once went out to look at my Cherokee or asked to drive it. Just gave me way more than it was work. In hindsight they probably drove it around back and poured sludge in the engine to destroy it under the Obama bailout to give dealers $4500 for clunkers. Kind of sad to see that Jeep go. If you can find a low mileage well cared for Cherokee XJ from that time period, buy it."
"WILL...NOT...DIE!  This is February, 2016.  The car is a 1998 Jeep Cherokee Classic with 84K miles.  REALLY.  84K.  It's my 3d Cherokee.  Prior a 2000 and a 2001 Cherokee Limited.  I sold the 2000 to a friend when it had 160K.  He reports just this week that he's at 245K and still going!  The 2001 was much the same.  These cars are, by my way of thinking, absolutely bulletproof.Now.  1998 Cherokee Classic.  The only addition to the car is a set of 2000 Limited alloy 16"" wheels.  Other than that, just as it came from the factory.Within a week of this last purchase, the turn signals just stopped.  I bought a $15.00 flasher relay, and back to the road!  Of the three I have owned, this was the first electrical problem I have encountered.It handles like a Jeep.  Not the best, but predictable as the sunrise.  Never let me down.  Goes where it's pointed.  Never stuck, and NEVER left on the side of the road waiting for a tow.  When the A/C is charged, you can almost hang meat in the front seats!  The heater is capable of burning your feet.  The radio is really not bad (the 2000 had the good stereo with door mounted tweeters and and amp under the back seat...that was REALLY great).  I wish it had a CD, but I wish I were taller...neither of those things are going to happen, so the radio is fine.This is a SIMPLE car.  Point/coil ignition.  Climate control with cables.  They're adjustable.  Not like the vacuum operated controls.  Manual 4WD engagement.  Everything in the cabin is push-pull-click.  No push-pull-click?  Replace switch.  Repeat.  Read the gauges.  DO REGULAR MAINTENANCE!  Change the oil (You don't need a lift, or a jack).  Don't forget the auto trans, transfer case and the two differentials (I do them every 50,000 miles, but I'm obsessive).  Lube the suspension zirks.  How hard is THIS?I guess I rant.  But as long as I can get these, I'll keep buying them.  They're getting rare, but they're findable (I made that word up) with a little searching.The car looks good.  Anywhere.  Party in the high end part of town?  Fine.  Running down a dirt road producing billowing clouds of dirt?  Fine.  Axle-deep snow?  Smile.  You look good and you ain't stuck!  By the way, this is essentially a new car!The long and short of it is, this car is a throwback to a simpler time when things broke but could be fixed with a pretty sparse toolbox.  My dad the engineer said these cars operated with ""tractor technology"".Under the hood it's all simple.February, 2017 UPDATE15,000 miles later the usual stuff.  The A/C evaporator, dryer, and heater core were replaced. After 3 of these cars, I think I can surmise that it's  certain  these components fail after 15 years. Had transmission flushed, and both differentials and transfer case drained and refilled. Fog lamp and rear window washer/wiper switches replaced. So one year out I've spent a little over $1,000.00 on maintenance items. Total into this car is $10,500 and I expect at least 3-5 more years before I sell it for $7,000.00.February, 2018 Update:  Had to get a radio with CD player.  1 Factory Radio LLC in Virginia supplied a re-furbished original AM/FM/CD and gave me $ for the old radio.  Transaction took a week,  Bolted right in.  $200.00.  Leaky radiator.  As long as I replaced  that I replaced the water pump too.  I was already in the engine bay anyway.  This car is Emerald Green and looks new.  I actually get asked (more often than you might think) if I want to sell it!  Gas station, traffic light, Costco parking lot, by complete strangers!  I was offered $10,000.00 in the Costco lot after the guy gave the car the once-over.  I kept the car.104,000 miles now.  Still pulls like a train.  And looks great.  And I haven't had a car payment for over 2 years.Summer, 2018Ok.  I've replaced the a/c condenser, compressor, dryer, and the evaporator (the heater core as well)   I CAN hang meat in the front seat it's so cold.  The water pump and the thermostat and housing.  Belt as well.  Generally, if I'm in there, it's just easier to start replacing things rather than wait for a failure.  The rear springs are getting tired, so I'll replace them at the end of the summer.  Remember, I HAVE NO CAR PAYMENT.  My son and I are going to Arizona from Michigan in mid-August (I was raised in AZ,  so I can take it!)  And we're taking as much of Route 66 as we can.  I really can't wait to take the Hatch Cutoff (if it's still there) off 66 going south out of northern New Mexico  ( I took this short cut to  Tucson years ago and spent two hours at 105 mph and never saw a living soul).  Hatch has become somewhat famous for their chili.  Anyway, Tucson appeared pretty quickly.  Holding a 1976 Chevrolet Monte Carlo at 105 for two hours was a spiritual experience.  A carton of cigarettes and a thermos of Holiday Inn coffee were my constant companions.  So that's my plan.  I have no fear of taking a 20 year old car on this quest.  I'll fill you in on the road."
One of the best Jeep ever  Very simple to drive and maintainingsolid construction and great offroad ability in this classi wish jeep would make that jeep again
i will always own a cherokee  I have owned a cherokee for 5 years. i paid $2k for it and have invested in a 3in rough country suspension lift and 30in yokohama geolander AT tires. not a hill in arizona i need to go up and havent been able too. ive never had to turn around on a trail. keep in mind jeeps are built not bought. i hear stories of peoples jeep bugging out on them early ill tell you first hand its because the owner did something wrong. 4.0 straight 6 are bullet proof. economic and powerful. from the trailto the road. there will always be a cherokee in my garage even if its not a primary. not enough room to say all the things i want about it. jeep cherokee's refuse to die. remember theyre built not bought.
"absolutely indestructible  Father drove it home brand new off the lot in 1998 from lou's jeep eagle in Geneva illinois. It's in my garage as I write this next to the wife's Acura mdx. I can't put into words how amazing this vehicle is. I refuse to buy another car until she dies on me. 311,346 thousand miles and aside from tires batteries belts lights. .ya know wear items. ..she's been solid as titanium!Years ago when roads were impassable I was passing hummers and other ""4wd"" vehicles."

Expected more...  Was reliable until about 100K.Was constantly in the shop.At about 118K was in the shop monthly.Finally overheated on the side of the interstate and was pronounced dead.I was expecting much more from a Jeep.Previously owned a 93 Cherokee and made it just past 200K before it died.
RIP  I loved it. It was my first car and only had it for about one year but was amazing. I was driving on the highway when something hit the transmission case and cracked it. my insurance deemed it as total loss and towed it away. I will miss my jeep soo much. RIP baby. Unfortunately i will most likely not get a jeep as my second vehicle due to bad gas mileage 
"Love my Jeep  Fantastic vehicle. Reliable, comfortable, small but big. The best I've worked on, the best I've driven."
98 jeep xj   228500 mi and still as strong as the day it was born JEEPS RULE THE EARTH all others try to follow 
"Best auto I have ever owned!  We leased this car in 1997, drove it till the lease was up then purchased it in 2001.Without a doubt the most reliable car I ever owned.It now has 387,000 miles and running strong.The only things I have had to do to it was the AC compressor which died around 360K, and the muffler/plumbing.Crankcase sensor, had to replace it 3 times, but not for 3 years now. An idiot (last cc sensor failure) convinced me I needed a valve job, so OK, 270K, go ahead.He called me to come look at something.I went, he showed me the clyinders, and you could still see the original cross hatching, and no ridges!AMAZING, that 4.0! PLESE bring it back with the 4.0 and I'll buy till I die!"
"Bring back the Jeep Cherokee  A great car for off road, and for me has been just fine on road.Has been pretty reliable for the first 13 years, then problems (see below)."
"Wish they still made these.  Best vehicle I ever drove.  Fun, powerful yet small.  My trip computer says I've averaged 19.2 mpg including pulling a camper and daily driving.  "
"Keeping for the kids  I have owned this jeep for 11 years and it is the most reliable car I have ever purchased. Jeep only has 70K, but has dents and scratches from trees, rocks, bikes. Always starts, never comfortable. Goes through snow, mud, sand with no problems. Powerful engine, you can hear the frame groan whenever you hit the gas. This is the perfect car for my two teenagers. Never in the shop for any reason, other than normal maintenance. I need a more comfortable SUV but I can't afford a new one. I like the Nitro, but heard many bad things about it- maybe a used Trailblazer?"
"A Beast  My 1998 XJ was given to me by my father.  Although it is rather old it still can open up and be just as powerful as the day my family bought it.  So far it has over 210,000 miles on it and still runs and looks like a champ.  There hasn't been a single time I've been stuck somewhere or unable to get where I needed to go.  Service on this Jeep is nearly never needed as long as the oil gets changed and the gas if full.  The only issue I've had is with the gas mileage. However, you can have gas mileage or you can have power and a strong, well- built car."
"It's a Jeep  Purchased 98 Jeep in '06 with 70,000 K's in Australia. Have spent last 3 years towing a caravan on a mobile ministry and wouldn't replace it. Now has 135,000k's on the clock and apart from servicing hasn't cost anything. Looks like it will go forever, God willing."

"I'll Miss Mine  My Mom bought a 98 Cherokee Sport in October 1997  and she said this was the best car she ever owned. A little over six years later this became my car and it lasted another six years. Had some electrical issues (fuel gauge was useless) and one or two major repairs, but when it came down to it this was one reliable vehicle. Fuel economy was decent (16 city/21 hwy), ride was fairly comfortable, and the 4x4 was outstanding. Had to trade her in at 140,595 miles, loved her so much got another Jeep (06 Wrangler Sport, like this one too) but I will always miss her. Honestly, if they still made these Cherokees I would've gotten one. "
"BRING IT BACK PLEASE! BEST JEEP EVER!!!!  I recently have bought my 4x4 Jeep Cherokee classic with 110,000 miles and it is the best thing I have ever bought in my entire life I love it! No doubt if they came out with one I would buy it in a heart beat! :) runs great have had no problems with it. Completely reliable with the inline 6 engine! I cant decide if I want to put bigger wheels on it or not because I love the body style so much as it is! Jeep needs to bring it back! Worst move ever by discontinuing it!"
"Bring it back!!!  Bought it with 55K, put a clutch in it shortly after due to previous owner. Now has over 130K. Mechanically more reliable than anything on the road, but the body is rusting pretty bad. Only weak points are the saggy rear leaf springs, all you owners know what I'm talking about! Relatively cheap aftermarket fix though :) Getting hard to get factory parts for due to Chrysler going haywire."
"Won't die unless YOU kill it  My Jeep has an engine and transmission that just won't quit. Despite years of being driven by a mechanically-deficient person, it always seems to start and get us down the road. As far as creature comforts go, forget about it! The a/c was the first to go, followed by the control panel (speedometer, gauges etc) which often requires fiddling with the trip reset button to get the gauges to work again. Then, alas the heater has started to fade. Couldn't ask for a better SUV for living in the snowy north, but the lack of amenities in this old mule is a definite relationship-ender."
"it wont Die  267,000 miles...more worried about the rust possibilities than anything mechanical. It is a dependable tank. Not glamorous, just reliable"
My Big Little SUV  I bought my jeep with 93 thousand miles and have 113 thousand now and have had very little go wrong. its my second Cherokee. My first one was an 88 limited and i sold it with 377 thousand miles and was still running very well This thing will be buried with me!
"Champ  I bought the jeep smashed up in the front for a great price.  Bought some new and used parts and painted it in my garage.  Has been great ever since. Yearly maintenance is $100-$200 on average and I pile the miles on it. More reliable and durable than anything on the road. Everyone says in these reviews that they wish they still built them, the truth is that they do in China.  AMC/Renault put a plant there in the 80's and they still build them today.  Maybe they will offer them for sale here, I would buy one."
"The BEST Vehicle I have ever bought !    I bought mine back in 2005 it is 2WD and it had 90,000 on it. The price was right so I couldn't pass it up. I am so glad I bought that Jeep, this May will be 5 years that I have had it, and I have only a few repairs. I replace a water pump at 145,000, and a clutch at 180,000. Other than that it has been only your basic up keep. I now have 220,000 on it! It's still going strong, this vehicle has sat put year round in the MN cold and it has always started, not once has it not. Everything still works great in it except the air did go out at 183,000. I will never get rid of my Jeep its been awesome! It is sad to know that they did stop making them after 2000. "
"There is nothing better for the money!  What is not to like about this car?  It's beautiful, fun to drive, RELIABLE, and has a spunky engine."
"98 Cherokee  This car started as a lease, ended up buying it.  Price was too high due to the unexpected purchase, but it is still running with 227,700 miles and doesn't use oil yet. Highway mileage is 20 mpg.  On a recent trip, driving about 50, I got 25. Much less in the city.  Only problem that are chronic are with the cruise control (won't hold the speed) and the air conditioning (doesn't work even after being re-done)."

"reliable is the name of the game  This truck has been in my family since 98 now has 120,000 miles w/automatic trany truck has been so reliable I just cant sell it it wouldn't make sense. Many great memories behind the wheel truck has kept my family safe and secure everyday never have I found a snow storm that this 4x4 cant handle not the coolest ride on the road but certanly the most reliable one purchase I absolutely don't regret. My uncle also had one w/250k miles same model truck 4-speed auto. Cant wait till my trucks at 200k it'll prob. Run the same it always has I love you Jeep"
"1998 Jeep Cherokee Sport  I bought the '98 Cherokee Sport brand new in June 98. Eleven years later it drives like new. Its engine has gained fame has incredibly reliable, the best of the best from Jeep. I've driven it everywhere. It can go 100mph comfortably and get out of any snow bank. It's a shame they discontinued it. As someone over 6 feet tall, I really appreciate the great head room!!"
"Reliable and Long-lasting  We are at 250,000 miles and going strong! This car has served us well, so we are keeping it, even after 10 years!  The drawbacks have always been the same: it is noisy, and there is no leg room behind the drivers. We chose the Jeep because of the wide space in the back (fits a 4-ft wide object in the flat, and is high). We also like the rack on top and the comparatively small outside dimensions & lots of window area (maneuverable & easy to park), and on slippery roads in the winter we like the safety of 4WD.  "
"The end of an era  Rugged tough vehicle with plenty of power on tap. Well built and gives you plenty of street cred. Yes, it is rather juicy but what else would you expect from a four litre engine. What I loose in fuel bills I save in general repair costs. Why on earth did they stop making them?"
"Love my Cherokee Sport!  I have loved my jeep since the day i started driving it. I have the 5 speed manual transmission, this is the only way to go, i can't even imagine having a boring auto. The Jeep has 132000 miles now and is still running strong. Hardly ever done any work on it, only new shocks, u-joints, cat. converter, and muffler.The shocks were just something i did for no real reason, just thought it would be a good idea, but my u-joints did go bad. Love the 4x4, the front seats, love the ENGINE! Very reliable. Never lets me down, always starts right up in the cold too. It is a wonder to have in the winter. Michigan winters are pretty intense, and it is just unstoppable in the snow. Would buy one again now!"
"Best vehicle I'll ever own  I inherited this when my dad passed a couple of years ago, and between him, my mom, and myself, we've put 55,000 miles on this Cherokee. My mom and sister both have Grand Cherokees (98 and 99), but neither compare to the way this one performs on or off-road.  The ride is a little bouncy at times, but that's to be expected for a truck-based SUV. Even then, it rides much better than many current car-based SUV wanna-bes and newer mid-sized truck-based SUVs with independent suspension, IMHO.  I'll also tell you that this is one vehicle the designers and engineers got right, even with upgrades as the model years moved along."
"Computer hell  I have replaced the computer in my 1998 Cherokee Sport 3 times. Luckily the last two were still under warranty. My mechanic tells me that the '98 model does this but the '97 and '99s don't. Tried junkyard dealers and was told they can't keep 'em in. Also the tach, speedometer, air bag lights fail intermittently. Probably different problems.  Dont like the location of the ""gear"" indicator, causes me to look down, away from the road ahead.  Otherwise I love it.  "
"The best Jeep ever!  Ok, I bought this great Jeep in 2004 and I have put on over 80,000 miles without anything more than wear and tear slowing me down.  Extremely reliable, why did they get rid of this?  "
"Nothing else ever will compare  I love this jeep. I'm on my 4th year of owning it and can't say enough. I've put around 80,000 miles on it and at 150,000 it still runs like brand new. During the winter, we had 24"" of snow and it was below zero and it was nice being the only one in the neighborhood who didn't have to shovel the drive. When the plows came and buried the drives, I just climbed over it. Fuel mileage really does stink on this one though. I drive like an old lady mostly and I get 13 city and 17 highway/interstate.  But, my wife gets 30 in her car and i still pay more a year keeping hers on the road. I've not changed anything but a wheel hub, tires, UV joint and battery. Not bad for 4 years of heavy driving."
My 2 wheel drive jeep  So its two wheel drive. My friend has a Blazer I can get everywhere he can just as fast. With out the 4 wheel drive. So it doesn't get stuck I love her.

"Southern Jeep  I bought my 98' Jeep used in 2000. It's the best money I ever spent!! This bad boy has NEVER seen the inside of a garage. Just minor repairs from wear and tear (and too much 4 wheelin!!). I have 187,000 miles and it purrs like a kitten. The only way to describe thos model Jeep is unbreakable!! I would not even consider selling it. Liberty, Commander, Compass, yeah righ. These models cannot begin to fill the shoes of a 4WD 98 Jeep Cherokee!! Bad move discontinuing this model Jeep. "
"2 door bigwheel pimp!  I got my Jeep in October of 2007 and I love it! I received it with 93,000 miles on it and it has bout 120,000 miles now. Just recently I had to replace the crank shaft censor and the radiator fan assembly, but overall it's a great build and like a rock.  Mine is 2 door and White with tent and I have big bowlegged tires on it and I just changed the grill to chrome to match my rims. I am officially obsessed with my Jeep and its brand."
Built to Outlast !!  I have had a Jeep Since 1994.I Bought my 1998 Cherokee in 2002 used. I have had some work done but all was wear and tear.I plan to bury this Jeep until the wheels fall off or it cost to much to fix(replace).That's how much I FEEL about my Jeep.P.S. Look around for these Jeeps. It's hard to find them like this !
"Is this for real?  My Father brought this home new when I was in high school. He used it for the work commute. Last year, with 212k problem free miles on it, he just gave it to me!! I now have near 245k miles on her and it runs and sounds just like when he first brought it home!! I cannot say enough about this engine and vehicle!! It boggles my mind that Jeep could get rid of it!! You couldn't PAY me to drive a Liberty! 3. who? I really believe that with my REGULAR maintenance I'll get well over 350k. We'll see!"
"Is this vehicle real?  Back in High School my dad bought this jeep and brought it home as a work vehicle. Traveling to and from Chicago and back to the burbs. It was given to me last year, 10 years later and with 276 thousand miles!!! on her..she still runs and sounds the SAME as ten years ago! Though the fuel economy sucks, I have never had a vehicle be so wonderful in ways never thought possible. Its more reliable than any vehicle made on earth and handles better in harsh weather than cars that cost 3 times what she did. "
Lot of Miles  I bought my Jeep new and now have 178000 miles on it. I have done very little maintenance on it other than regular stuff like oil changes etc.. I get around 23 mpg with the 4.0 six/5 spd. I still have the original clutch in it. I wish they still made the Cherokee.
"Excellent Spare/Snow Vehicle  After exchanging our Subaru Outback for a mini van we found our selves without 4x4 for the first time.  And we proceed with the snowiest winter in recorded Wisconsin history.  We bought this as a ""spare"" vehicle, I say spare but it is now being used more than our 07 Hyundai Entourage Limited mini van.   The 4.0 with the 5 speed accelerates with force up to 65 mph.  The snow capability and stability easily rivals our old Outback, and the off road ability absolutely crushes the Outback.  It is also far cheaper than a used Outback.  I really like Subaru's and have owned 7 of them, but I like this Jeep better than the 2000 Outback we owned.  "
"The best vehicle ever built!  I have driven my Cherokee to hell and back, and it still keeps ticking. Yeah, I rides like a tank, leaks some, and does not get the greatest mpg, but it is the most reliable vehicle I will ever own. It has never left me stranded, stuck, or regretful. After 200000 miles, I still get the same mileage, and performance as I did when I bought it.  Great project vehicle, and daily driver.  I recommend anyone to buy it. Mobil, Lucas, K&N. Total cost of repair at 200,000+ miles--$2000, minus wear and tear (plugs, oil,tires, etc.)."
"The Best I've Ever Owned!  I purchased this Jeep 3 years ago when it had about 70,000 miles. Before this Jeep I owned a '95 model. Today I've more than doubled the mileage (157,000) and I've tuned it up once, turned the rotors, replaced a radiator hose, and spent a minimal amount on the front end. (I've four wheeled a little and got air a few times... probably my fault.)  Just routine maintenance.  I expect to have this car until it drops. I would recommend this car to anyone... just make sure it's been maintained well. I use synthetic oil and Lucas additive."
"The Truth and nothing but...  I inherited a '96 Cherokee in 2001 with 260,000 miles. Made many repairs to worn out parts but no faulty parts and unecessary towing bills with this vehicle. I ran it until it had 330,000 miles and then sold the vehicle for a surprising amount with many offers. At that time I purchased a '98 Cherokee with only 98,000 miles. It has treated almost as well as my  first Jeep, but they just don't build like they use to. Well actually they don't build them at all anymore, but I suppose that's because the Wrangler got all the attention."

"Wish Jeep still made this vehicle  I sold my Jeep Wrangler because I got tired of messing with the tops, and bought my Cherokee used, in perfect shape. I take it camping annually. Its great on back roads, or no roads. I've taken him through streams, sand, on slick rock, over sagebrush and rocks, ditches and snow. It holds all my gear with room for me to sleep in it. Mine is a white Limited model, so it looks classy, but I bring it back covered in dust, mud and bugs. Great sound system, comfortable, powerful, great turning radius, great ground clearance. A perfect car for all purposes. The only thing I don't like is my back road and expressway combined trips average only 15mpg, not too good, but not bad enough to sell it!"
"Mixed bag  This is the second Jeep 4.0 motor vehicle that I have owned. This version is the high output version (approximately 190 hp). I bought this used and specifically wanted the ""sport"" version for its increased off-road ability. These small Cherokees are very reliable. A bit snug inside - the rear seat isn't made for adult Americans. Gas mileage is about 16 combined which isn't bad for a 4x4 with a/c and auto trans. Rides too stiff for the wife. The price you pay for the ""sport"" suspension. No cruise control either."
"A little beast  I bought the Jeep with 87,000 miles on it two years ago, now it has 97,000. All I have done on it is replace the AC unit that comes inside of the dashboard (which was broken when I bought it). That was $600.  I keep it completely standard and I just love it! it has the tough SUV looks from the outside but once you get in, you have the leather, heated and powered seats, powered windows and locks, the wood trim dashboard and so on.  The 4.0L six cylinder in line engine is awesome; sometimes, when standing on a red light if a  little so called ""fast car"" pulls next to me, they don't expect the quick response of the Jeep and I leave them thinking I got ""something extra"" in it."
"True Sport Utility  This is one rugged SUV. Utility is the key word here. I take this thing off road, on 3000 mile road trips, to the grocery store, lumber yard, skiing, hunting, fishing, tailgating. It has 120,000 miles and starts instantly. Goes off road like a warrior and has a classic look. I took two 6 footers, all our hunting gear for a week, with a roof and tongue rack. I tow the snowmobiles with this. All that and it parks easy, is good around town. I needed a reliable rugged  vehicle. The rear defroster is out, the fog lights are short circuited, but she starts, clips in 4x4, and everything else works. If WWIII breaks out, this is the vehicle you want."
"Boy do I love my Jeep Cherokee!  Best used car I ever owned after 25 years of driving. Zero maintenance vehicle, fun to drive steady, easy to handle, stable on all kinds of roads."
"Just What I Need  This is my first vehicle, and a great one at that. I drive a lot, and I usually get about 22 MPG with it. I can use it for hauling my friends or my ""stuff"" around. It was built tough; I rolled it last July, but had it repaired and it looks and drives like new again. A couple of things have been replaced, such as the tires, spark plugs, clock spring, and brakes. I bought it at 83,000 miles, and at 142,000 it's still going strong. Great vehicle!"
"Best Car I've Ever Owned  Absolutely the best car I've ever owned. I-6 engine is bulletproof.  Only thing it's ever needed is oil change every 3K.  Just ticked over 153K and still runs like it did the day I bought it. Replaced clutch throwout bearing at 130K.  Replaced brake rotors at same time.  Otherwise it's needed nothing but oil, tires, plugs, and brake pads.  Back seat is small for adults due to wheel wells.  Off-road performance is absolutely great.  Turn radius is very tight, making it easy to drive in town and park. Easy to work on, although it's never needed it other than the clutch. My only regret is that Jeep doesn't make them anymore.   "
"Jeep Cherokee  This vehicle has been everything we could have imagined and more, and she still has a lot to offer. One of the best 4x4's we have ever owned. It would go through snow and ice like it was dry roadway. The Best."
"It's good for me...  I bought this Jeep with 117,000 miles on it.  I had to rebuild the steering and put tires on it.  The exhaust manifold was broken (a common problem on the 4.0L Jeep motors), but I replaced it with a lifetime guaranteed manifold from Gale Banks Engineering.  It runs great and has no problem merging with traffic getting on the Interstate highways.  It has the leather seats and I may install seat heaters because of that.  It seems a little more cramped inside than my '86 Cherokee, but it's still not too bad to drive three hours to work. "
"Bulletproof 98 SE 4Dr, 4WD  Bought it NEW in '98, now have 136K on it. Have the 4.0 L I-6 motor & 5 speed manual tranny -- super strong. 23 mpg highway is FAB for a boxy SUV this capable. Like the look, like the color (chili pepper red), like the performance, LOVE the durability.  NO major repairs.  Biggest repair item has been waterpump. HUGE value for the money. We have the cheap dash w/ idiot lights, and the gas gauge has had problems for years.  My wife's vehicle, and it does all our ""dirty work"" hauling stuff, and ALL snow duty.  Interior is plain, back seat best for kids, but tolerable for 1 - 2 hour trips for adults. I see these Cherokees ROUTINELY go 250-300K. 4WD is easy to use. ALL JEEP, ALL GOOD."
"Best new car I've owned (I've owned 8)  First the bad.  Struggling to get a full tank is unacceptable.  Turning the nozzle upside down usually fixs the problem.  Car is kinda thirsty but for the performance you get on regular gas, it's within the bounds of acceptable. I have an automatic and the hesitation on downshifting is unacceptable and unsafe when driving aggressively. Now the good. In over 39000 miles, it's never left me stranded.  Never been in the shop for repairs. Cabin is squeak and rattle free still.  Took it on a 8000mi trip and NEVER got out of it with a back ache.  Stereo is great. Seat, console and door armrest position is the best I've ever had.  I love the car and I'm not an easy person to please.  Worth a look!"

Ryan's Jeep Review  Very reliable.  Kept regular maintenance schedule ... minimal down-time for mechanical repairs over the life of the vehicle.  In family since new.
"couldn't of picked a better vehicle  This vehicle could drive through a cow pasture and come out smelling like a rose in my book. Te most dependable vehicle I have ever owned. I have over  150,000 miles on it and changed a power steering pump on it; that's all. These Cherokees were made to last. I will continue to purchase this Jeep line forever. "
"What a Jeep!  Bought this Jeep, my first Cherokee, used in 2000. Traded in my '93 Wrangler for it.  Thought I would hate it without the rag top, but this car is great.  Carries my kids and all my toys.  Runs great in all weather/conditions.  I now have 170,000 miles (68,000 when bought) and am just starting to replace original equipment.  Only negatives are the gas mileage and my instrument gauges periodically fail. No mechanic has been able to find the cause.  Despite that I will never buy another SUV other than a Jeep."
"4 wheeling  I bought mine with 64,000 miles on it. It now has 112,000 and is still going strong. Overall dependability has been very good, just regular maintenance. Yes, it's loud, mileage is pretty bad & the back seat could be more comfortable, but it's also very practical. Love it ! And, it never feels like it's going to tip over, like other SUV's. I don't have any modifications made - all stock. I never thought I could have this much fun in an SUV !"
"Not a single problem  Bought at 15k and driven daily since 2001. A great vehicle. No major issues. Great fun to drive. The 4.0L puts the ""sport"" in sport utility! Built solidly, no rattles, etc. It is a shame that Jeep stopped making this body style and this porven engine. The new Liberty looks like all of the Japanese SUV's out there."
1998 Jeep Cherokee  Only repairs have been replacement of driver's window motor and window/door lock switch.  Replaced tires and battery as a precaution since both were 7 years old.  
"My Tank  I bought the Jeep new because I was 
tired off getting stuck in the snow. 
The Jeep is like a tank and rides like 
one also. I take it hunting and drive 
it over plowed muddy fields without any 
worry of getting stuck. I have 65,000 
mi on it and have had no major problems."
"Excellent, tough truck.  Cherokee's have always been a tough, 
reliable 4WD. After owning one for 
years and 120K miles, I agree. 
Luxurious, no. Many vehicles are more 
comfortable. Small, nimble, simple 
vehicles, yes. Very durable too. One 
turn signal switch has been replaced. 
All other items, tires, brakes, oil, 
etc., were maintenance items. This is a 
vehicle that has seen many offroad 
miles in the Southwestern deserts, and 
it seems to be just breaking in.  
Offroad, it will leave posuer 4x4's
(Xterra, etc) behind, including very 
expensive ones.
The 4.0L engine has more in common with 
a tractor, but they'll run past 300K 
with basic shadetree mechanic skills. A 
simple scan of the used Cherokees bears 
this out. A+"
"A little adds up to a lot  I've enjoyed our Jeep.  Purchased at 
68K and now at 109K we've had to 
replace the exhaust system, the heater 
core, the AC core, the water pump, the 
brakes, the left signal doesn't work, 
and the left speaker also doesn't 
work.  With a ten year old in the back 
seat it's too small.  We also had to 
purchase a turtle for the top b/c the 
back is too small for a family of 
four's luggage.  But all in all, we've 
enjoyed it and plan on keeping it for 
awhile.  After all, we've had all of 
the work done!  What more could go 
wrong??"
"Now it's nice  When I first bought it, it was major 
trouble...I needed the water pump, the 
oil gauge and something else replaced  
the first 6 months and it was heating 
up alot. The battery went out  4 times-
the rear cargo door wouldn't close all 
the way  and ran down the battery....I 
thought I had a lemon. Almost filed, 
but the dealership fixed everything OK 
and it has been reliable since then, 
except it seemed like it needed new 
tires and brakes too often and I do a 
combo of city and expressway driving . 
It always goes through the water and 
snow- it does slip in very sloppy 
conditions. "

"Great performance, crappy interior  I am a high school kid who bought the 
jeep with 87000 miles on it. Got for a 
heck of a deal, $6800. It is an 
amazing car except when it comes to 
the interior. All the cheap plastic 
and other junk in there rattles or 
squeaks. The backseat is also a pain 
in the butt to get in and out of. Also 
the gas gauge seems to be getting a 
little weak. Just last weak i was on 
empty, put 6 bucks in and some how was 
still on empty.???"
"Bring back the Cherokee!  1st Cherokee was a '90, bought new. 
Bought this one new also & now has 85K 
miles. Still love it, but am 
considering buying a new SUV. Hate the 
Liberty!! So probably will move to 
Grand Cherokee, but I prefer the 
smaller size of the Cherokee. It's 
easier for me & my dog to get into. 
I'm a real estate agent & if it 
weren't for the hard-to-get-into back 
seat, I wouldn't be thinking of 
changing. It's been just great, very 
reliable and still looks new!"
"V6+stick+low weight+4WD=great  to drive  Owned since new, now has ~50K, runs 
better than ever. Great to drive with 
V6, stick, and lower weight than most 
SUVs. Strongly recommend stick-like to 
downshift into turns to manage SUV-roll 
risk while keeping up power. And it 
helps with mileage (18-20MPG). Only 
maintenance has been oil chgs & tires 
once.  No rust/exterior problems, 
though it has been garaged mostly.  
Would get 4DR - trick to get in/out of 
backseat.  Still not sure 4DR that 
would make it a family SUV-ride is 
pretty bumpy for munchkins in car 
seats.  Echo all comments about 4WD & 
snow; with locking 4WD (not AWD with 
differentials) you get great power & 
traction. "
Bad SUV for the money  I spent a lot of money on my Trailhawk. I am very sad to see the horrible resale value. The transition has had to be repaired 4 times in only 30k miles. The GPS does not want to update and is horrible. Gas mileage is okay but it cannot seem to calculate it correctly. Many other small electronic issues. 2 recalls that I know of.
"2015 cherokee latitude 4x4 4 cylinder  4cylinder underpowered , new cherokee has a better interior i believe ,also they need to work out the kinks in the transmission"

"great suv  everything I want in a car, safety features, gas mileage, design, comfort, are very good."
"Good and bad  Pros:  Off road capability, tow capacity, overall size.   Cons:  Short on cargo space, can't disable the auto engine shut off feature, U-Connect and radio software not reliable, transmission frequently clanks hard between gears."
There is NOTHING good to say about this car!  From day one it has been nothing but trouble! From the transmission to the tires to the gas. Where do I even begin. 30K later I have a piece of crap that btw has been babied and taken care of since day one and it had a transmission failure 3 months into owning it. That happened 3 times before the warranty gave out. Then there was the tires... they lasted all of about 1 1/2. Im not an off roader by any means nor do I have extensive city driving with pot holes. But yet treads down  to nothing and now chunk missing. Great and lastly the check engine light. That has come on because the suv is running so rough that it feels as if we are sliding down a cliff on your bum. I want mention all the minor things that have ben a headache as well so just do yourself a favor and AVOID THIS CAR LIKE THE PLAUGE!
"90,000 Mike review  Great comfort for a 4wd, good off-road ability stock but needed improved tires (All Terrain).  Very little maintenance needed, only oil changes at 10,000 miles, air cabin filters. Recommend K+N type air filter."
nan
Like my Trailhawk  Does everything good except tow behind motorhome.
"glad i do not have to own this  the head lights are extremely poor on pittsburgh roads (hills). low beam has no for a short distance. there is a line that cannot be seen above. it is dark. high bean has very limited range. the heater/air condition is lousy. while warm air appears quickly it is inconsistent. feels like either warm is present but once it gets to temperature cool air blows. same happens when using the ac. the cabin temp is either hot or cool, no uniformity. just poor ride quality.  driver seating control affords poor comfort. the transmission is annoying while coasting to a stop it constantly downshifts then up again within a few feet travel. up and down, up and down, continuously. this happens even when locked into 3rd or 2nd. or this maybe the torque converter lock and unlocking. very poor engine braking again when downshift and locked. no room in back seat. overall glad i leased."
jeep cherokee review  Less than pleased with the car as a whole.  It is an ok vehicle but has some problems with acceleration etc.  Maintenance of it in San Diego is a real pain.  I have tried all three dealerships and they are the worst.
"Stay away!  Loved this 2015 JEEP Cherokee Trailhawk for the first few months, then the recalls started to roll in. Oh, and still going to the dealership for the same recall fix (tomorrow will be the third time getting the back liftgate fixed, that won't latch/lock). Even though I went in under the warranty/recall to get things fixed, and they weren't fixed properly, so I'm back in Service Dept – now that I'm out of the warranty. they won't give me a rental car (not the dealership, not JEEP)! New favorite issue with the JEEP is when I'm sitting at a light and it's about to shut off because it's not getting enough gas perhaps. You guessed it, another fix that I already brought to the dealership to get done. Round 2 tomorrow.Our JEEP from the 1990s is running better than this POS.  Not buying another (new) JEEP."
"Run, don't walk away from this junk  The transmission is horrible and the dealership says it is as designed and make no effort to correct the problem.  Our 16 year old was driving it and at times it would lurch foreword for no reaso, it is an accident waiting to happen.  The shift lever is easy to bump and if a passenger turns to the back seat it is easy to knock it from drive to neutral.  There is no lockout.  The fuel mileage is horrible, worse than my Challenger 5.7 Hemi, and the stall feature at stops is dangerous considering when you start the transmission can lurch foreword.  The Navigstion is inaccurate and inferior to the Dodge as is the entertainment package.  The Cargo area is small and the seats uncomfortable.  The car is a nuicense and a safety hazard and resale shows how poor the car is.  We just traded it in on a Chevy because, in my opinion,  it is too dangerous to drive.  This car also has unending recalls resulting in uncompensated lost work and expense taking it to an uncaring dealer."
"Hated at first, but like it now!  We purchased this vehicle in May of 2015. About 1600 miles in the Transmission ""sensor"" failed and the ENTIRE transmission needed to be replaced. Ouch. This didn't settle well with me, but I let the dealership have a go at fixing it and they were able to replace it within 5 days and we got a loaner vehicle so it wasn't THAT much of a problem. We all know these cars have transmission issues NOW lol. Here we are at 47,533 miles and there hasn't been an issue since then with the Transmission, HOWEVER, the HVAC motor blower have recently been giving us problems. It works when it wants to. The check engine light has come on and every time I take it to the dealer the light turns off and there's ""Nothing we can do except check the code"" when I take it in haha! This is pretty much normal for every dealership. They want to see the check engine light ON. I figured out that it's the blower motor so I bought a replacement and am waiting for it to come in to see if replacing it works. It could also be the module that conrols the motor so we'll see. I was able to file a claim to have the dealership look at the issue but I got impatient and want to try to fix it myself. It's not expensive. Other than those two issues the car has been pretty much perfect. We average about 25-26 combined mpg's which is great (according to onboard diagnostics). The bluetooth SOMETIMES has a hard time connecting to my wifes phone but it's not a big deal. Just have to do it manually. I give it a 4 star because I feel 3 is too harsh and 5 is too kind considering our initial problem and current one haha! Road noise is fine. Engine noise is quiet. We like the vehicle in the end. About to try to sell because family is getting bigger."
"Ticking time bomb  This car is flashy, and has some really cool features I'm and out, but looks aren't everything. I've had my 2015 Cherokee for less than a year and I'm on the hunt for a new car. The transmission constantly slips, slamming into gear, and I'm just waiting for the day that it finally dies. In addition to the transmission slowly going out, now the electronics in my instrument cluster are going out! A two year old car shouldn't have any of these problems. What a hunk of junk!"
Engine light came on and found P0128 code  Thermostat replacement cost and coolant antifreeze is required. Dealer gave an estimate of $ 700. the parts for thermostat is 32.50 and coolant is 35.50. but the labour cost is 539
Worst purchase I have ever made  The transmission will not go into park about 50% of the time.  Since it doesn't always do it it is easy to continually make the mistake of thinking park=park then backing up a few inches before realizing it.  This 'feature' killed someone so they recalled and instead of fixing transmission (and admitting flaw) they added a feature where your car cannot back up with the door open.  So it still happens but can't kill you.  The 'capless' gas tank doesn't work at 75% of gas stations and I had to hold the black rubber pressure catch on gas nozzle to pump gas.  Nearly every time I got gas.  The performance of the vehicle is nice but these other items ruined the entire experience of driving every time I got behind the wheel.  Additionally the AC makes constant noise like there is an issue with the freon but was told ' just kind of happens' by the dealership.  Traded it in last week for a VW GTI and am soooo glad even though I lost thousands on value on the Jeep.  LEMON
"Didn’t expect to fall in Love with Jeep  I was initially disappointed cause I couldn’t get all the bells&whistles my previous Dodge had. I was actually mad at “her” for almost a year! My eyes were finally opened when we had our 1st snowfall in 2016 & I realized the benefit of 4WD. Then I realized how fantastic the fuel economy was compared to my Dodge Journey R/T. In addition my Jeep has been extremely dependable & I believe only had 1 or 2 recalls for very simple things. I would say my favorite thing about her is the 6 Cylinder 289 HP (I believe that’s accurate) she gets up & goes without any hesitation. I have a heavy foot so I like my car to have that ability, when needed, or just for fun! Overall I am sad that my lease is up & our time is over. If the buyout wasn’t ridiculous I would totally have bought her, just on a strict budget currently. This has been my family car for almost 4 years. It held up to having 3 kids, 2 who are messy, sloppy teenagers, & a Chiweenie who wants to go on every single car ride (and mostly does)! The cloth interior held its own, however that would also be my only negative comment. I hated the fabric used for cloth in this vehicle. Every single hair from my clothes or dog weave into the fabric. It’s damn near impossible to get it out! I keep about 4 lint rollers in the Jeep so I can keep interior clean but also to remove hair that transfered back to any dark clothing we wore. Also almost forgot, the UConnect has a mind of its own. Half the time it won’t connect, there doesn’t seem to be a particular trick to fix it either. Used to turn vehicle off & back on but it doesn’t help. I believe it’s based on if your phone connects to the UConnect App. But the stock radio sounds like garbage as I guess does any stock radio, but I’ve had days where even the radio wouldn’t come on wouldn’t do ANYTHING! Definetly needs more thought & effort on Chrystler’s behalf. Even in my Journey with the upgraded sound system that sounded amazing, the connection was almost rare. It works when it feels like it is the best I can say."

"Buyer Beware!  At 22k miles while I was on my way to a relay race with the car packed with all my gear, it died on the side of the highway.  With no warning (thankfully I was in the slow lane already), as I pushed on the accelerator the car decelerated and came to a stop on the side of the road with ""service transmission"" error showing up. They told me that the cylinder head melted - no explanation as to how/why that happened as of now.  I have kept up with all recalls, maintenance at my local dealer.  After nearly 3 weeks in a dealer for repair, it is ""fixed"".  Though I am concerned about this happening again and will not be buying out my lease.  Also, read the warranty carefully when you buy/lease a new vehicle as Chrysler does not include a rental for any warranty repair work!  I really lucked out that the dealership provided me with a loaner or I would have been without a car for 3 weeks!  And the support from Jeep/Chrysler is a joke.  They assigned a ""case worker"" to help with the warranty process and all she does is make phone calls on my behalf."
"Go with the V6  I bought a 2015 Trailhawk with the 3.2L V6 about 3 months ago and I love it. I was leaning towards a Charger or similar car and i drove a Jeep Cherokee Latitude and feel loved it. After doing a little research I saw that the Cherokee is a heavy vehicle and the V6 was a much better option. I ended up finding a 2015 Trailhawk model with the 3.2L V6 for a good price and I've been in love ever since. I wasn't sure about the 9 speed transmission 2015 being the first year but I must say I've had no performance issues at all. At 270+ HP it's got plenty of power and i pass people with no problem. It can be a little sluggish off the start while the 4x4 is in auto mode but not if you need a little extra boost put it in Sport Mode and your good to go. I've even taken the Trailhawk off road twice and I was blown away with the performance and ability of my new, ""used"" SUV. My only complaint is that I've had issues with the 8.5 inch Uconnect touch screen and have read that the issues with it are common but it's getting replaced free of charge. I've heard a ton of complaints about the limited power of the 2.4L 4cyl engine but as far as mine with the V6 so far I couldn't be happier."
"Needed a new engine at 23k miles  I purchased a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Altitude Edition. The Jeep had 4,500 miles on it when purchased and was owned by the dealership. The Jeep was only 6 months old when I purchased it. I purchased this vehicle for my wife for dependability and weather since we live in Pennsylvania where seasons vary. After one year I received a phone call that my wife was broken down on the turn pike and the car stalled out. We had it towed to the nearest repair shop. It simply ran out of oil. No leaks, no nothing. Just burned through it. I topped it off, and noticed it burned over 1 quart every 1,000 miles. Ended up taking it to the dealership and had an oil consumption test. I was not expecting them to tell me I needed a new engine, but that was exactly what they said. Engine had severe scorn marks. Took 4 weeks for the engine to be installed, provided a rental. It was covered under warranty. I got the Jeep back two days ago and it is back at the dealership because of a very loud humming noise coming from it as I drive it. After this is repaired we are strongly considering getting rid of the Jeep and trading it in and never purchasing a Cherokee with a 2.4 mopar engine ever again. Engine replaced at 24,800 miles. First sign of damage was around 19,700 miles. Took 3 weeks to schedule an oil consumption test. Only reason why I feel it deserves two stars instead of one is because of the hospitality I have received from the dealership."
"Well, mine's been fine!  Well I've read a lot of the bad reviews here, but in almost three years of ownership now I've been back to the dealership twice, and both were for oil changes. Once was just because I was getting worried that the vehicle hadn't asked for maintenance in a long time! Hopefully I don't jinx myself by saying that. I've had no mechanical issues, although I do agree with those that say the transmission generally isn't great - it's just kind of a pig, and takes a little bit to get in gear. But this is an SUV, and that's pretty common to SUV's (this isn't my first Jeep, either). It's just not the most responsive vehicle ever made, though once it does engage, it's really quick with the 270hp V6. I did have mine built to order and maybe that made a difference (it wasn't an early build, and maybe they even take more care with BTO vehicles), but I just haven't had anything I needed to worry about since getting it in February of 2015. I also love the comfort and the interior, though I wish it would remember the auto start/stop setting. I don't want to disable it forever but I only use it in specific situations so I'd like it to default to off.One update: I had always meant to upgrade the tires, but was forced to after only 15,000 miles because two of them cracked. OEM tires usually aren't great on any car but the Cherokee Latitude's tires are even worse than most."
Do NOT purchase any JEEP vehicles  My car is only two years old and I have had more fixes and issues than I did with my previous used vehicle but yet I purchased this one brand new. I gave this a very horrible review due to the fact that I do not feel safe while in my vehicle since I don't feel safe about even having my own family in my vehicle than why should anything else matter regarding the car. I had just returned home from a 2 hour drive when my transmission decided to go out for the second time. Thank goodness that I was on a surface street at the time and not still on the freeway. Imagine what could of happened to me and my whole family had it happened on the freeway. I am done with this company. I'm sure the dealership will be telling me it's an update that is needed when I just took my car in for an oil change 3 weeks ago.
"If you like lemons, then this is the car for you!  UPDATE: I have had to take it into the shop 3x now. The most recent was the compressor stopped working. Less than 20k miles.Please do not buy this steaming pile of dog poo on wheels.  My dream was always to own a jeep because I had only heard good things about the brand.  My husband and I needed a larger vehicle before we welcomed our amazing daughter into the world. The 2015 Jeep Cherokee was the perfect vehicle for a very very short time.  This hunk of junk has 15k miles on it now and all of sudden we have a whole host of problems; The jeep well not accelerate for a good 15 to 20 seconds after you hit the gas, the radio/display will not turn on when you turn on the vehicle, bluetooth will not connect, parking brake engages by itself.  For your safety, i urge you not to by this ""jeep""."
"Buyer WARNING!  Sincerely disappointed in the performance of my 2015 Jeep Cherokee Limited V6 engine. I purchased the car brand new in July 2015 and immediately experienced problems with a rattling/squeaking panorama sunroof and rusting of the paint on the hood of the brand new car. Repairs were made on both by a local Chrysler/Jeep/Dodge service station, where an employee informed me ""the sunroof rattled because all Jeep parts (with the exception of the Jeep Grand Cherokee ones) are made with the cheapest parts they can get, and that's why they rattle."" This should have been a warning flag because this conversation occurred only 5 weeks after ownership. Time went on and the rattling/squeaking sunroof came back, the speakers rattled a low volumes (again an indication of poorly manufactured parts) and I starting experiencing new problems where the check engine light would come on and spontaneously go off, and issues with the fuel gauge. The fuel gauge would only ever fill to 3/4 and would have huge swings while driving (one minute have 1/4 tank, the next 3/4). To fix said problems, the local service department would have the car for 6 days (of which I was given a loaner car). Chrysler parts headquarters is located only on the west coast and we were informed,  ""Chrysler rules do not allow for overnight shipping of each part"" thus, adding to the delay. To add to my frustration, on numerous occasions when I picked the car up, noticeable collateral damage from the repairs would occur, including a broken rearview mirror, a torn passenger leather seat cover and door trim, and other various dirt and scuff marks of which I would yet again have to return to the service station to have addressed. I am coming up on 36,000 miles, the end of the manufacturer's warranty, just under two years of ownership (yet another flaw that Chrysler puts so little faith in their cars). I was greatly encouraged by the local service department to purchase the $1,500 extended warranty because in their words ""the radio, which controls almost everything electronic in the car, will be the next to go (cost of $1,400 to fix)."" In summary, although I was attracted to the interior design and look of the car, it is built with poor-quality parts that rattle and break down, and I made over thirty trips (I counted all service records) to the local service station for repairs and collateral damage fixes in just under two years. Prospective buyers of this car, I recommend do not purchasing this car and consider a certified pre-owned higher quality car with a long-term warranty."
"The service department has this car more than I do  The 2015 Cherokee only has recalls on days that end in y! Constant recalls and transmission problems with this POS! Half a dozen visits to the dealer for a transmission problem that they say they cannot reproduce. Then, the entire transmission needed to be replaced. Now the trans is slipping again and frequently ""slams"" into gear. Only 25000 miles on this heap! Two more trips to the dealer and ""cannot find a problem"". Problem is I bought a Chrysler product. Or, should I say a Fiat. I would tell them to ""Fix It Again, Tony"" if they would fix it. A friend had the same vehicle and dumped it off on CarMax. Will be trading this Jeep in before the warranty is up. And NOT on another Chrysler product!"
Bad transmission  This transmission is the worst transmission I have ever had!
"I guess i did not buy one of the lemons  I'm not completely sure what all the fuss is about in problems.  I have had one shifter issue, where all the lights came on and the dashboard said service shifter. i took it to an out of town dealer, because i travel, i received a rental car and it was fixed in two days.. i did not schedule, i just drove it in there. I bought this new in 2015 when they first came out, i had the very first one out of the dealership.  this first issue happened around 36K, it just happened again at 76K but it went away. so i have not taken it in.   everything runs fine, and i'm a mountain guy as well as i travel a lot.  i am not nice to this car, i hammer the gas and drive it consistently at 70 to 80.  i also take it off road to my property and to a mining claim where the jeep does great, no issues when flipping from 4w low to 2w high.  i bought it to put miles on and commute. i get around 32mpg on average.   the interior is great, comfortable, i love the seat heaters, but they could use seat coolers!!!  I will say that i have never towed with it, but i plan to tow one of my jeep trailers i built for the Rubicon.  its only about 300 lbs, so should be no issue.   also looking to tow a boat soon, which is around 3500 lbs, 1000 lbs below the limit they state the tranny can handle.   One thing i dislike and i would love to shoot, is the GPS and the navigation chick,   seriously stupid.  pretty much this i my biggest gripe with the SUV.  i need this in the city's when i travel, i dont do well with other people around in a small car. id much rather be driving my other Chrysler product an 02 dodge diesel 6 speed, and now people they just move out of my way with that... back to the Jeep.   i have 79K and change on this jeep and have had some great trips and zero issues. i have install a rocky mounts cargo rack, i carry all my camping gear, sluice box, hunting, misc on the roof, about 300 -500 lbs on average, still no issues.  i am 6'2 and 220, ive had four guys in it all my size, it does get sluggish with all of us. but it is what it is, i wont complain about that.  Although this is my experience, and i can only speak for myself.  One other item before i go, ive also wheeled it to the slabs and the back side of loon, this was a far as i was willing to take it, and not one issue!!  I hope this helps some of you out there.  one thing I've been looking for is upgrades, minor lift kits, and aftermarket accessories, not to many out there.  when this rig hits 200K she will get some Unimog axles and be turned into a wheeler."
"Love that Mustang  My Ford Mustang is the most enjoyable 
car I have ever owned and it is 
practical too!  Reliably built, a heavy 
muscle car, lots of pick-up and a real 
head turner.  Fully loaded it was a 
great deal and continues to hold its 
value.  I have babied the car, in the 
garage all the time, washed every 2 
weeks and waxed quarterly...pristine."
"Poor quality, poor engineering release  This is actually the 3.2L V-6 model. Will never own another Jeep product again. 4 recalls and one ""campaign"" fix issue later; on the third radio now, as well as a transmission leak. This vehicle has been in the shop longer than all my previous vehicles combined in 24 years of driving experience. Transmission shift is still horrible after several computer updates, now at 43k miles it has started to leak on my garage floor. Headed back in for service once again"
"KL is way underrated! Bad rep from bad drivers?  I was skeptical when I first purchased my Jeep Cherokee Sport (KL) two years ago. It was the second year (2015)  for this body style and the return of the Cherokee into the Jeep lineup. Many longtime Jeep enthusiasts dogged its crossover styling and the technology over its offroad capabilities. For those who want a serious offroading vehicle, the Trailhawk is going to be your best bet from the KL family. Cherokee hobbyists have now created a two inch lift (and some change) which allows for beefier tires and a more aggressive stance on the Trailhawk, while all other models can find something similar to give their Cherokee a bit more height and light offroading abilities. For the large majority of Cherokee owners, offroading is not on the agenda, so I'll stick with things that definitely stand out for me. I've owned 12 vehicles in the last 20 years, and that includes everything from Ford and Chevrolet to Honda and Toyota, Mercedes and BMW. I'd rate the Cherokee as a 4 star SUV in its class. The interior might not be the most impressive that I've come across, but you get an SD card reader (for audiophiles), bluetooth connectivity, USB ports, CD player and auxiliary input - 5 options for connecting your music! The aesthetics of the dashboard and front cabin are very welcoming and easy to reach everything. The cargo area is about the size you would expect from a Cherokee; anything bigger needed and you should look at the Grand Cherokee. The engine boasts about 184 hp and 170 ft-lbs of torque for the 4 cylinder (cannot comment on 6 cylinder power) and is very nimble in traffic. In the past two years of owning this vehicle, the servicing has been very minimal and light. This Cherokee does feature a lot of computer enhancements, so you will need software updates of your vehicle once every 9 months or so. If you've owned any other modern car from the 2010s, you will know this is not specific to Jeep or the Cherokee. I believe a lot of the bad reviews come from people who have had unfortunate luck, or they just have little patience. I probably would not have even written this review if owners had not rated it so low. Realistically I would give this vehicle a score closer to a 4 out of 5, but these Cherokees are really fun and I won't be getting rid of mine anytime soon. There is also a whole community of Cherokee KL owners who absolutely love their Jeeps (and modifying them!), so don't let a few sour reviews turn you away."
"This is the WORST car ever made!  DO NOT BUY THIS CAR WHATEVER YOU DO! This car has been nothing but a heart and headache. It is absolutely terrible. Purchased car in the summer of '15 brand new (less than 35 miles) and just recently traded it in (with a little over 26k). If I could give this car negative stars I would. This is a death trap on wheels. While driving this car it literally completely shut off in the middle of the road. I was driving up a steep hill and around a bend. The engine completely shut off and the check engine light came on. I'm so very lucky to not have been hit. After getting car going again (which was a miracle itself) I made it back to my destination. I was 3.5 hours away from home. I attempted to drive it home to have it serviced. It made it less than 15 miles up the road before AGAIN having the engine completely shut off, in the middle of an intersection. $300 and tow to get it to a dealership anywhere close to home. It spent three days in the shop and one long commute to pick up my ""fixed"" car that wouldn't shift out of park. I've lost so much money on this having to trade it in. In just a year and a half it's worth almost HALF of what it was purchased for. I will never ever buy another jeep the rest of my god given days. This car is not worth a stick of gum. If you care about your safety and the safety of others on the road, I wouldn't even look at this car! IT IS TERRIBLE!!! It's the very definition of a lemon!!"
"2015 Cherokee is junk!  Bought this car in Aug 2015 brand new car started out driving smoothly then at about 6000 miles or so I noticed the jeep began to drive different and then it got worse and worse, in October at 11000 miles being on the jeep I had to get the transmission replaced, the jeep began to drive like it once did go until January it began to jerk and accelerate on its own, just when I was going to make an appointment to get the car looked at the shifter locked on me causing to have to come to an abrupt stop luckily it was 5am when no one was out or I surely would've been in an accident I took the jeep in and they replaced the entire shifter, and did something to the brake vaccum pump  since then the car is still jerking and accelerating by itself especially when going down slight hills do not buy this car!"
"From a Jeep to an Audi A4 and Back to a Jeep  Had a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited with a 5.2L V8. Bought it used in 2000; excellent condition inside and out. Problems: Always present. Electonics, transmission, A/C, front and rear axle bearings .... you name it. Nonstop issues. Swore I'd never by a Jeep again, especially considering how little Mercedes Benz seemed to care about building up the brand after acquiring it circa 2000.                         Enter the 2006 Audi A4 2.0T Quattro. Flawless. No issues. Perfect. But, wanted an SUV again, and the Audi/MB/BMW versions are just too damn posh and elitist for me, esp. as I enter my lat 30s. Wanted something that says ""rugged"" and is rugged.                           Extremely impressed, after trying out  several SUV makes, just how much care FCA has put into the Jeep brand. Every bit as luxurious as the Audi, more advanced (about 10 years newer), best NAV/media interface I've ever used, unbelievable off-road abilities, my transmission has been flawless -- not one issue, although I know it's been a major general complaint. No reason for 9th gear, though.           So, ""old"" Jeeps = poor quality but complete awesomeness, nonetheless. Audi = my favorite upscale brand -- so precise, well-built and, as an added bonus, less ostentatious that it's rivals. New FCA Jeeps = Luxurious, rugged, sleek, precise and high quality. And the V6 with the Trailhawk's capabilities equals perfection in its class. And, higher resale value (let alone abilities) than Ford Edge, which I consider a better rival to it than the Ford Escape."
Beautiful design inside and out  Good looking suv with lots of great features just dangerous to drive when you pull into traffic. Shifts terrible. Even after 6 transmission updates. 2.4 liter engine is weak. Would not recommend this car to anyone.  Poor resale value for a jeep as well. I will say the 4 wheel drive works awesone in the snow. Safety and reliability however kills this car. Looking at being at the dealer every 6 months for a new transmission update.
"Stay far, far away!  So first I bought a 4 cyl Limited the thing was horrible no passing gear and would bog down when trying to pass and a shimmy in the front end. Traded for a V-6 thinking it would be better. Drove it home (had zero miles) and no sooner than I got home and decided to run to the store the fuel pump went out. Their is a shimmy in the front end of this one now too which I was told is part of the vehicle. The heat for your feat also comes out the defrost. I have to purchase 1 new tire because of the shimmy that is PART of the vehicle. My trade in value sucks so I am stuck with the worthless vehicle. The back seat is to small for my 12 and 13 year old for long trips. My advise stay far, far away!!!"
"Do not buy this Jeep!  The sales person was informed on the phone and in person several times that I did not want a 4 cyl vehicle.  I was under the impression for a year that I was driving a 6 cyl with little to no pick up and a bad transmission.  I only found out from the service department when I picked up the vehicle from one of numerous visits to the service department that they thought it drove ok for a 4 cylinder.  I was stunned.  I pulled out the window sticker to check and it doesn't indicate if the vehicle is a 4 or 6 cylinder vehicle at all.  My fault for trusting the sales person.  I am stuck with a 4 cylinder Jeep Cherokee with major transmission issues, at 22K miles the struts went up as well as the thermostat, the lift gate has come down on my head twice and does not sense that anything is in the way (It's a good thing a small child wasn't under it)  once it almost trapped me between it and the bumper, I just realized today why the heat doesn't work in the car when I reached behind me to grab something off the floor and noticed that while I have warm air blowing in front, ice cold air is blowing on the floor in the back.  I don't even know what else there is to say at this point.  My next call is to the General Manager and then to Chrysler.Update 1/4/2018- and the saga continues with this vehicle.  Chrysler replaced the transmission and when I picked the car up from the dealership I drove the car to a friend's house.  When we got back in the car and I put the car in drive and stepped on the gas, the car went in reverse.  We both looked at the shifter to see what gear it was in and sure enough it was in drive.  In addition to this issue, on 4 occasions while accelerating from a stopped position, the engine will stop pulling the vehicle.  The RPM reading 4-5K rpms and the car is drifting to a stop.  Chrysler says they cannot recreate the problem.  The car will engage after coming to a full stop and start accelerating again.  The owner of the dealership recommended that I trade the car in and take the loss because there are problems with all 2014 and 2015 models and as of the date of our conversation, they weren't having the same issues with the 2016 models.  The service manager put in writing that this was not a safe system.  When I asked him if he would let his wife drive the car, he said absolutely not.  Now I am in litigation with Chrysler and Don Whites over the car.  The newest problem that just started 2 weeks ago-water started pouring in through the overhead light."
Stay away!  This is the worst car I have ever owned. If you enjoy hanging out in service dept. this is your car.
"nightmare of a purchase  I have a 2015 Jeep Cherokee with 15K miles on it. Since buying this car brand new I have had oil leaks, antifreeze leaks, thermostat replaced, weird noises coming from the engine that have left the service people clueless, excessive oil burning, and have had the vehicle completely shutoff while in motion on numerous occasions.  I have also found the transmission to be very jerky.  In November of 2016 after numerous trips to the shop, the dealer has decided to completely replace the entire engine!  What a nightmare this vehicle has been!"
"ford junk  first ford i ever bought i bought the 
conv v-6 with every option ,at 27000 
miles the transmisson failed,the door 
bolts on the hinge fell out,the valves 
rattaled all the time ford really let 
me down with the quality of this car.i 
will not buy a ford again"
"Decent SUV, but...  I bought this on a whim after having my '08 Wrangler blow up on me. I needed a vehicle and needed it now. I opted for the Latitude package with the 6cyl and 2wd. First impressions were good comfy, stylish I liked it. Over time though the transmission began acting strange and the check engine light was on. Long story short I'm now at 20k miles, after about 7 trips to the dealer the check light is still on and transmission is annoying at best. Software updates have done nothing it still shifts abruptly and randomly sometimes winding up between gears or slamming into gear so hard it jolts the whole vehicle. Dealer service is another matter (not good)  so I'm stuck with a jerky transmission with very questionable long term reliability and a plummeting resale value. I would not recommend. Which is too bad because the rest of the vehicle is fine."
"TOO MANY RECALLS  I bought the Jeep Cherokee Latitude in September 2015, the 1st recall was not a recall, a transmission line from the engine to transmission ( the car was sitting in my driveway ) my wife went out to go to the store, all the transmission oil was on the ground. I was told by the dealer that a ""O"" ring kit was blown (sitting ). since that time i have eight other recalls, now i have the 9th one, all this has taken place in one year, this just too much, i have had it, i am at my wits end. what can i do??????????????"
"STAY AWAY  Do not entertain the idea of trying a vehicle with a 9-speed. My 2015 Jeep Cherokee has been in the shop 7 times since I bought it a year and half ago. 9-speed transmission has no idea whether it's coming or going. RPMs spike (3500-4000) when going down or up hill and does not lower till you're on the straightaway. By that point, you have minimal power and when the transmission figures out what gear to be in, it clutters/jolts and puts you in a lower gear then you can continue accelerating.     When approaching a STOP SIGN or you YIELD, you slow down and then accelerate and the transmission hesitates then shutters to get you going. My dealerships states ""They are not able to duplicate the problem"" yet I drive it off their lot onto the roadway with these problems occurring. Service Manager rode with me so I can ""reproduce"" the issues and I was told ""It's normal"". I had a loaner from the dealership while Chrysler arranged for an engineer to work on fixing the transmission - the loaner was a Chrysler 200 Limited. This vehicle's transmission performed the same as my Jeep."
"Review of the V6 Engine Jeep Cherokee  If you are thinking of buying a Jeep Cherokee, don't get the 4 cyl engine. Go the extra money and get the V6. Gas mileage is almost the same and it has better performance. Also the transmission will shift a whole lot less while on the highway with the V6 engine making for less engine noise. The only problem I've encountered with the vehicle was a manufacturing defect with the transmission in the first 7,000 miles, since that was corrected it has been smooth driving.March 2017, I still have the car and it now has 34,500 miles on it.  I still enjoy driving it and the gas mileage is still avg about 26.5.March 2018, I'm still driving my Jeep, it now has 40,600 miles on it."
"Absolute Lemon.  To start simply, this car had a rebuilt engine and transmission within the first 2,500 miles. I was warned in years past never to buy a new model's first year because the companies are usually working out kinks and i wish i listened. The engine started overheating really badly at about the 1,800-2,000 miles mark. I bring it in to the dealer and those inept mechanics told me it was a faulty spark plug or something and gave me the car back next day. Within three days i had to bring the car back and on this second trip they told me the engine got so hot it cracked the engine block! Three or four weeks later i get the rebuilt car back and within 10 days of that, the transmission was completely out of whack. I bring it back and about a week later they ""fixed"" it and returned it to me. I fought with chrysler corporate for months to get me out of this car that i didn't feel safe in but they only care about their bottom line and basically told me to sue them. I don't have the money for lawyers especially for a lease so i'm left counting the days till i can dump this trash. I know one coworker who had similar problems to me but because he financed his he went the whole 9 yards got a lawyer and the car was deemed a lemon and he got his money back. I CANNOT ADVISE STRONGLY ENOUGH AGAINST THIS CAR OR ANY CHRYSLER PRODUCE AFTER THE NIGHTMARE I WENT THROUGH. You've been warned!"
"STAY AWAY FROM 9 SPEED TRANS. LATTIDE 2 JEEP CHRE.  From the first week I complained about the transmission as to how it jerks the whole car while changing gears. This is a 9 speed transmission and believe me the  Jerking is so bad  that it will give somebody a whiplash. It does not behave like a new car.  I took it  to the dealership and was told that it has a very intelligent computer and once it (the computer) figures out my driving habits it will smooth out. I now have 16,000 miles on it and it is getting worse.    I purchased a life time warranty for that reason,  I don't know what that is worth. One thing I have to admit it is great in the sand and snow. It is dangerous in the rain.  While on All Wheel Drive, do not accelerate around  curves as you will find yourself in the next lane over. This is not my first new car.  The last 50 years I purchased close to 15 new cars and this is the first LEMON I got.     REVIEW STILL APPLIES. THIS CAR IS A LEMON.(February,24,   2018"
"Love my trailhawk...mostly  6cyl by the way but Um.. I love this jeep, for the most part. Seats were fairly comfortable, leather was soft. I had a few issues with the screen, had to be replaced once, bluetooth wouldn't always connect. Ball joint went bad pretty early on though, yet two dealerships said it was fine. Its now in the shop having the knuckle assembly replaced. 4 wheel drive was difficult especially if you wanted differentials. Jeep rode great, not terrible gas mileage. I'm hoping they worked the kinks out now."
"Crime it's called a Jeep  It's my fault for purchasing this high priced piece of hot trash. After owning a 1998 Cherokee that gave me ZERO issues and a half million miles (literally) I decided to try another twenty years later. I'm not stupid, I realize nothing will produce what the old fashioned straight six would in terms of dependability and torque, but it's a new era and it's all about mpg and style.  I test drove the Wrangler, Grand Cherokee and of course this rolling hemroid before burning my cashier's check away on the Trail Hawk. Ranting about how terrible everything from acceleration to zero torque, to the plastic interior and cramped quarters won't do it any justice. Please just realize that your better off buying a Honda fit and spray painting a 4*4 Badge on it. Their about the same except maybe the fit has more testosterone. I just cannot get over how Daimler murdered this brand name. The other two ""jeeps"" I test drove had mini van V6 engines in them and also needed a strong wind from the back and a downhill to get up and move. If your thinking of buying a ""jeep"" after 2003 model year then do what I should have done and burn your money outside the dealership and know it's better than driving out of the lot in your new Fiat with an awd option called jeep. I paid cash for mine and plan on donating it to heritage for the blind or cars for kids in order to regain at least some of my dignity.  Rest in peace Jeep."
"Do not buy Cherokee. You will regret it.  When I bought this one, it was smooth and relative quiet inside for the first two months.  After two months, violent shifting of transmission and trembling of the engine became severe. I went to the Jeep repair shop several times to fix this problem. They always said that this transmission is the worst one ever and there was nothing they could do except S/W update from Jeep. But officially they said that there was no problem with this car. Even when my car stalled on the crossroad two times on the way to children's school, they repeated the same word. It was very risky situation to my family. I really recommend you that you not buy this model. You will regret it."
"Jeep what???  Update: Filed lawsuit against Chrysler, forced them into a complete buy back. They never suggested giving me another car...paid all fees, my expenses but I had to agree Chrysler was in fault. So they will put it back together and sell it to some unsuspecting person without them knowing the history. Since then the list of undependable cars, jeep with fiat motors and transmissions are all listed as bad choices.   That's my update. Bought 2015 jeep Cherokee 4x4 limited. Had less than 2 wks, won't start, when it does start, transmission out. Was at dealer for 3 wks, two new transmission modules later, got car back for 20 hrs. Has 500 miles on it.  Had towed back to dealer...same deal, transmission. Dealer had for another 4 weeks, then stripped down to wire harness. Dealer refusing to back me, towed vehicle home, have an atty, lawsuit filed today against Chrysler. Chrsler refused to respond to first atty complaint so now in civil case, oh and I'm making payments....since April 17th. A. Mazing!  How can I review my new car I can't drive?"
"Best car so far!  So far, out of many vehicles, this is 
the best.  This is not a car for the 
shy-it gets looks ever where it goes.  
It doesn't matter what age, or what car 
they may be driving-just two days ago 
it got looks from an F-body driver!  It 
is a blast to drive, and comfortable to 
ride in.  I haven't had one problem 
with it so far.  The interior has a 
little to much plastic for me, but I 
like the set up.  The exterior, in my 
opinion, is much more agressive than 
the previous body style.  All in all, I 
love this car!"
"Transmission SUCKS and alot of JERKING !!!!!!!!!!!  The jeep cherokee limited is a great looking Suv , However the 9 speed Transmission Sucks !!! The salespeople will tell you its a smooth ride which is true however if you like to be jerked forward at times going 56 miles an hour i felt like i was going to get whiplash . Immediately called the dealership since my vechicle is only 8 months old and complained about the jerking once again which makes this number 2 for taking it back to the dealership . I was told by my service advisor ""It's like your cell phone we have to update the software  "". Seriously I have only updated my cell phone once in the last 2 years . I have been reading alot of consumers complaints regarding the transmmission and how the  dealerships keep telling consumers that everything is fine , if that was the case then explain to me why there are 190 complaints regarding the transmission on carcomplaints.com/ jeep , and also on Edmunds.com same thing consumers are reporting  Transmission problems . If my issue is not taken care of by the dealership I will be taking this to Chrysler. I did not pay 45,000.00 to have a vehicle transmission jerking ."
"Do not buy or lease  I leased a brand new 2015 jeep trail hawk. More recalls than any other car I've owned. Constant problems transmission number 1.  Doesn't shift right, accelerates on own, turns off when foot not on brake ,  in 4 times . lift hatch fixed 4 times twice with new parts. Just got it back and they replaces lift hatch and said nothing is wrong with transmission. I called Jeep to complain that I've done research and there are currently civil action law suits for the same. My husband received a call from dealer and it needs new transmission. REALLY YIU JUST SAID NOTHING IS WRONG WITH IT. I DONT WANT TO DRIVE IT. I WANT THEM TO TAKE BACK. We pay a lot of money for this top of line lemon."
"Do Not Buy this car!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I bought my 2015 jeep Cherokee latitude in September 2015, since day one i have had nothing but problems with it. first day complete computer reinstall and the headliner fell, two days later same thing, since then its had four axles and more software problems than i can count. dealership cannot find the problems and trying to work with the dealership and Chrysler corporate is like being between two babies that constantly fight each other. i warn anyone who is going to buy this car Don't its not worth it. I regret everyday with it and may be filing a lemon law claim or trading it in."
"Perfect for people on the go  The only real problem that this vehicle has, and that Jeep has addressed, is the 9-speed automatic transmission. The transmission sometimes slips during shifting, or it stays in a higher gear for much longer than it should when coasting downhill. This issue was a simple fix when I took it to the dealership and explained the problem. Everything about this Jeep is perfect for me. The price was right and the vehicle is very smooth on the road. If you've ever owned a previous body style Cherokee, then you may be more partial to that look, but 2014 and later models look better to me. It's more aerodynamically designed, and that's reflected in the fuel efficiency of 24 city (up to 26) and 31 highway (up to 35)."
OMG don't buy this car!!!  I bought this car May 11th 2015. I went to visit my family 4 hrs away for Memorial day 2 1/2 weeks later and the transmission light came on half way into the trip- less than 1500 miles on the car! I had to park my brand new car for a holiday weekend until a dealership opened up on Tues. They reset the light- said it was nothing. It came back on during  my ride home. I drove directly to the dealer. They had the car from May 27th-June 9th and replaced the transmission. I hadn't even made a payment yet. June 12th the light is back on!!! 2174 miles on the car. I only had it back 3 days..back to the dealer I go. Now they have the car from June 12-July 2nd and they tell me they have replaced the valve body. July 7th on my way to work and the light goes back on as well as the parking brake light and the 4x4 light. I smell something burning. The dealer has to come and tow the car away. Now I am calling Chrysler asking for a repurchase- I don’t want this car! They don’t call me back for three weeks. July 22nd I get the car back after a 2nd replaced transmission. July 28th back to the dealer again! This time a 3rd transmission is placed in the car and I get it back Sept 4th. The car at this point has 2664 miles on it. I filed a lemon law suit with FCA Chrysler on July 17th 2015. I am still fighting this claim. I have been driving the car since Sept but the transmission is not right. It screams down hills and does not shift. It screams up hills and shifts so hard the whole car jerks. The dealer tells me there is nothing wrong with this transmission. It does not shift well- this is not normal. Chrysler is not responding to the lawyers on this claim and they are trying to make me settle with a deduction for the miles I have put on the car. I cannot believe that Chrysler is handling this so poorly. I will never but another Chrysler/Jeep product again nor will I recommend them. The car stinks- the company stinks!11/25/16 update*** it took me until last week to have he lemon law competed. The transmission still slips and still screens going up or down a hill. I am so happy to be out of this car. The whole process was a nightmare and it cost me way too much money to fight FCA. I still stand behind my original review- horrible company and an ok car with a bum transmission.
"So Disappointed and Frustrated  I have had my car for just over 1 year. As I  write this and make a car payment my Latitude is with the dealer having its engine replaced. It has been there since last Wednesday and they are not sure if I will have it back by next week. The dealer's service department has been great. Chrysler's response has been disappointing. I am concerned about this vehicle and have wavering confidence about a safe resolution to my issue. The only way I knew there was an issue was when the car simply stopped working while I was driving. Thankfully, I was not on a major roadway and was able to safely restart and get to the dealership. While a recall may not be in order, I would suggest that Chrysler, at the very least, have each of these vehicles inspected for the defect as I know I am not the only one experiencing this issue. It took only a short Google search to find many who have had the same experience. It is really a shame, as I do like the vehicle."
"Garbage. Buy another brand.  Have my 2015 Chrokee for a year and a half. Always in the shop. Dashboard is like a Christmas tree. Dealers don't know how to fix it. Chrysler will not exchange car. Want me to bring it back a fourth time. Jeep customer care blames dealer, dealer blames customer care which won't authorize more costly repair. This is my forth Chrysler vehicle and my last.[contact info removed]"
"LOUSY 9 Speed Transmission !!  Stay away from ANY jeep with this 9 speed trans.   Stalls and bucks,  looking for the correct gear.  Delays pulling into traffic then will buck into 3rd gear.  Dealership lies and claims "" no Problem "" ! In shop 3 times for updates !  I sure hope that the feds do THEIR job and step in on the consumers behalf."
"DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE!!!!  This SUV is not worth spending money on! The first week I bought this Jeep the engine light came on 3 different times. Kept getting the runaround by the dealership. Now that I have had this Jeep for a year, I have realized buying it was the worst decision I ever made when buying a car. I paid a little over $32,000 and a year later it is only valued at $15,000-17,000. I cannot even trade for anything that I want because of the difference of value and what is owed.  The 4WD doesn't work right at all. I have had to have the gas cap fixed, a senor in the front bumper, the backup camera and other numerous things. This Jeep is not worth it. Buyer beware!"
"Transmission Issues  Please beware, they have A LOT of transmission problems. I've noticed issues on my first week driving it. The process of returning the car is NOT easy."
"Mustang GT Convertible Review  Car has been fun to drive and is generally dependable.  Have driven Honda's for the past 10 years prior to this purchase and noticed a significant number of quality issues with the Mustang.  Little squeaks, rattles and general small parts falling off or out of the vehicle.  Dealer calls it normal wear and tear."
"Worst Jeep I've had  My 2015 Jeep has the V6 with that stupid stop/start feature, I hate this. If you forget to turn it off each time you start the jeep at the first stop sign it shuts off, always catches me off guard. Next is the so called 4WD, wrong it's front wheel all the time and it's supposed to kick in the rear when needed. Even in the snow or mud mode front wheels spin like crazy. I bought my first jeep in 1977 and I've had 6 different models and my wife has had 7 Grand Cheerokes, I'll never have another Cheeroke like this one. Can't wait till my wife wants a new Grand Cheeroke so I can have her old one (2014) and get rid of my 2015 Cheeroke.Update couldn't wait any longer-traded it in on a Dodge Ram."
Worse customer service  I have had trouble with customer service at both dealerships I've been to and through the Jeep company itself. Several issues with car and I am not impressed with its safety on ice. I'm on the verge of trading it for another brand and I've only had it 1.5 yrs (bought brand new). Never again will I own a jeep based purely on the extremely poor customer service and maintenance service.
"Faulty Transmission Design  Transmission has a delayed response to accelerating when turning left against oncoming traffic.  Transmission is very jerky...not accelerating when it should, at some times, not going into reverse, causing several near accidents.  My 16 year old daughter learned how to drive with this faulty transmission..has caused her trouble driving other cars.  After dealership repair for 3rd time, I'm pursuing protection under the lemon law.  Dealership Service manager said there are no fixes other than software flashes that don't work and that even a new transmission replacement would be the same design/faults.  It amazes me that Jeep is still selling these cars with faulty transmissions."
"Love my Jeep Cherokee Latitude!  I have had my 2015 Cherokee latitude for almost a year now and I love it.  The transmission is different but once you get adjusted to it, you will not notice a difference.  For the price you can't beat the features and warranty that this car comes with.  We have 2 big dogs and this car has been perfect for us to take them around.  We highly love and recommend this car!"
Driver condition  I like my car but yes transmission was hard to adjust to. This car has issues but have all been because of the changes. The driver makes the difference. When I adjust to the car I have less issues. Not sure I like having to put so much effort in thinking about what that transmission has on it's mind. Not knowing if the car is going to want to go or not when you step on the gas gets annoying.  Don't like a car that leaps out from under you or hesitates. I think eventually this can cause a serious accident. It's embarrassing to be at an intersection at a stop light and the light turns and you cant go and people are honking. Not ideal situation at all. Causes road rage to some people.
"Love this Trailhawk  I traded in my 2015 Subaru Outback with 22,000 miles for a new 2015 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk and I’m glad I did. I didn’t have any issues with the Outback other than it just didn’t fit my style. The Outback did get better gas mileage (around 29 combined) but it had the 4 cylinder and the Cherokee has a 271 hp V6 and can tow 4,500 pounds! I'm getting around 21 mpg with mostly city driving in my Cherokee. This Cherokee drives and handles great, fun to drive. I find the Cherokee has plenty of room for passengers and cargo. My Great Dane fits in the cargo area just fine. I love all of the features the Cherokee offers, heated steering wheel & seats, Uconnect and sound system are great. You can go just about anywhere you want with the low range transfer case and rear locker. The select drive which has auto, snow, sport, rock, and sands/mud settings are a nice feature to have.  The 9 speed transmission is smooth and works well in all of the different drive select modes."
3 x's a charm 5 times a nightmare  My 2015  jeep v6 Cherokee Limited is now back again for transmission work it now sounds like a helicopter noise when doing 0 to 60 and more when going back from 60 to 0. I don't see how they can deal wi y h this 9 speed it should never have been used. My other car has a 6 speed and no problems.  This jeep is only 15 months old  and more trouble then the other 2 jeeps I have owned. Never again with jeep
"New car blues  Just short of 3000 miles, I had to have a new axle put in my NEW CHEROKEE 2015.  Ever since I've bought it the transmission has acted as if it's possessed with jerking, lunging, jerking out of first gear like it missed a gear.  All the time.  Every day.  I'm so frustrated with this new car.  Today, I'm driving a new dodge van because my new car is at the dealer for 3-4 days to make sure the car does what I said it does..... It's like they don't believe me.  Protocol... whatever.  The guy that sold me the car has driven it plenty of times and he feels the same problems with the car that I do.  So does a few other people that I've let drive it.  I'm hoping that it shows it's colors this week while the dealer has my car.  I know one thing, the transmission in the Dodge Van that I'm driving today acts just like a new transmission should act.  The Jeep Cherokee's 9 speed transmission is horrible."
"Great MPGs.... thats about it  I regret buying this jeep.  They are not at all made the way they used to be made.  Within the first 2 months of having it, the seat in the back bust at the zipper and cannot be repaired - has to be replaced.  One week after purchasing I had to take it back in because the tint was bubbling.  Now I'm at 15,000 miles and when you turn the car on, the RPMs go up and down and up and down and up and down.... then after about a minute they get back to normal.  The transmission does not shift properly and jerks you around.  I got the doors wet with rain and now all 4 of the door's interior are bubbling and destroyed.  This is the most expensive piece of crap I've ever bought.  I am so disappointed in Jeep.  Will never buy a new jeep again."
N/a  
Make you noticeable  That they will not regreat.
DONT BUY THE LATTITUDE!  The car was bought new 2015.  Its been recalled for 3 different things.  It accelerated on its own to the point where I have almost hit people. I was not aware the car would just take off on its on.  That was somewhat taken care of during the recall.  It downshifts on its own(sounds like its going to blow up) I was told this is normal but I don't think so.  It hesitates when you go from a stop to anywhere! I've almost been hit too many times to count. Its a death trap and I have no choice but to drive this car with my children until my lease is up.This Jeep still sucks (2017) and Im getting rid of it in December this year. It still hesitates from a stop to going forward..almost like its out of gas but nothing is ever wrong with it or so says the jeep dealership.
"FCA Drops The Ball;  Purchased a 2015 3.2L V6 Jeep Cherokee with the Auto stop feature on 04 Nov 2015 with 95 original miles on it. Within the first 150 miles of ownership the vehicle was taken back for a terrible back up camera and the odd shifting patterns with forward lunging in first to second gear. The dealership I purchased the Jeep from kept a full day to tell me theirs was nothing wrong with the camera and didn't even talk about the shifting patterns. So I assumed they tested and repaired. Nope was wrong to think that at all. Took jeep back again  at around 265 mile to again bring up the issue with the horrible hesitation and shifting problems. Service rep explained the vehicle needed to learn my driving habits and to break-in. So read the Jeeps manual and it stated break-in period of 350 miles. So I drove the vehicle with apprehension due to nearly being hit and almost hitting another vehicle. Jeep was taken back to service department with 587 miles where they performed a Trans quick learn procedure which only made the shifting and lunging worse. Was told to drive so the vehicle could learn my driving habits also. So I drove it to break-in as they stated but the issues never improved but just became worse. Vehicle was taken back at 858 miles and I explained it was progressing to get worse instead of better. They tested it and stated they could not duplicate the issues. Then was told that is how this model operates and it still is no broken in yet it required more miles  for break-in for that transmission and engine control modules to learn. Of course I knew this was nonsense. I contacted FCA customer care over the these issues and a case number was given at that point and was advised to take to a different dealership for a second opinion, huh was my response to that suggestion. A trip to Mississippi popped into the picture so had to wait till  I returned to follow their suggestion. I decided to drive the jeep to Mississippi and add these so call break-in miles to see if a change would happen. It became worse at times not wanting to accelerate through intersections to not wanting to accelerate while merging into traffic on I20 it was a scary drive. FCA was in contact with me and I told them what it did in Mississippi and Louisiana. The Jeep now has a long delay when going into reverse which nearly caused a on coming vehicle to strike my vehicle when I pulled out a little on a side road thinking it was part of a Canes restaurant parking lot in Ruston Louisiana. On the same trip returning from Mississippi on I-20 in DFW it became stop and go traffic heading west. Near Arlington I came to a complete stop on a slight incline with bumper to bumper traffic when the auto stop turned on like programed to do. Removed my foot off of the brake while hill assist was to remain engaged the engine had a slight starting delay more than normal and my jeep rolled backwards nearly hitting the vehicle behind me. I was under the assumption the Jeep would remain in place till engine started and transmission fluid pressure was back for the forward gear. Of course I became more frustrated with the dang thing now so took back to the service department  at 2256 miles for these added issues that could not be ignored. Service drove 6 miles and said can not duplicate after sitting several hours. Believe one of the sales people took it out for the drive instead of the technician. I know they are getting frustrated with me taking it back to them to repair but over $29,000 was paid for an unreliable vehicle. I finally wrote the CEO of FCA and explained the problems I was having with the vehicle and that I am only getting ""can not duplicate at this time"" response which I believe is now the policy with FCA. I received a call from a woman higher up the chain of command asking to take to a different dealership for second opinions which to me sounds like being pawned off and starting this run around all over again. I stated to her they were quick to put me into the vehicle so they should take responsibility for this since they know its history. She told me to set up an appointment at dealership I purchased it from so they could send a field service engineer so he could trouble shoot and see if a transmission replacement is required. Well two PCM re-flashes and of course no change it still runs the same. They kept from a Tues till Fri and it sat waiting on the field service engineer to advice the service department what the next step would be. I went and picked up my vehicle because no loaner was given while they determine what the heck was going on. I am still waiting on something to be done as of 01Mar 2016 by FCA. I looked into a class action lawsuit that has been filed against FCA dealing with this same problem and put my self and details on the list for these problems also writing a complaint the NHTSA. (Edit)1 Sept 2016 traded it for a 2016 Cherokee. Lost over 10g's in trade damn. 2016 9 speed trans is just as bad. Front suspension popping now."
"Wish I kept my 1998 jeep cherokee  I have always had a love for Jeeps. My first Jeep, Pigeon was a 1998 Cherokee Inline 6. I loved that car to pieces, she did me good the 5 years I had her, however, I'm driving a further distance to work and school so I had to give her up sadly. Ended up buying a KIA Soul, traded that in after a year because I was scared for my life in that car. Here I thought I was getting a dream car because I always dreamed about owning a new Jeep... Then this car entered my life and I regret driving this off the lot. I don't have as many problems as other reviews, but it's a BRAND NEW CAR and shouldn't have to worry about ""what if my warranty runs out and then all this happens"". This Transmission is really sketch. I hate the way it jolts at random. The acceleration in this car is just as bad as the Kia Soul that I traded it in for. The AC and heater are terrible. I can never be at a comfortable temp. You're either freezing or burning up. The gas is terrible on this car. I feel like my 1998 did way better in gas. The Uconnect is a joke. It works when it wants to work. I literally have to turn off my car at times for it to sync.  When it rains the tires spin and I'm not trying to jet off since it won't even do that if I tried. I'm very disappointed in Jeep. I was always proud to be a Jeep owner and now I'm kind of embarrassed. After seeing the crash videos on this car I hope I NEVER hit a pole or a wall because it seems this car like to burst up in flames. If I could get rid of this car I would. I want to take this car in and have everything  checked but from the looks of it, Jeep doesn't really care.  My love for Jeep has died. Whenever I get the chance I will get rid of this car. Unfortunately I have to wait many years before that happens. I better start saving now since my year is almost up in May. Do yourself a favor, don't get this car. I should have gone Import. I hate to say it but it's true."
"My Brownstone Beauty  For a MRSP of over $43,000, the car should include a CD player.  I didn't notice it did not have one until taking it home.  Also, never buy the extended warrantee at the time of purchase, as a better offer will come from Chrysler/Mopar shortly.  In fact, I have had multiple better offers than the one I purchased from the dealer.  I sometimes feel what I describe as a slip in the transmission when backing out and then going forward.  The dealer checked it out and could find no problem.  Please read the extended service contract.  You must have the required maintenance done at the proper dealer for warrantee to stand.  Other than that, I love the luxury feel and safety features of the 2018 Jeep Cherokee Overland.  I'm looking forward to driving my first SUV for many years."
"Very happy with this jeep  Have the V6 for towing. Very comfortable car, quiet and smooth ride on the highway. Get about 25 mpg on the highway going 75 mph, and 22 mpg around town or combined. So far no complaints. Shifts can be a little strange sometimes especially when starting up, but they smooth out after warming up."
"Great value  2018 Jeep Cherokee is a reliable vehicle that offers great value. The headlights are bright and offer good viability at night, the suspension is solid and the ride comfortable. While many have issues with the way the front end looks, I for one love the until recently no other SUV looks like it."
"Dipping my toes in luxury   Seven months driving my Jeep Cherokee and I’m still loving it.  This is the first time I’ve had leather with heated and ventilated seats, and I haven’t been disappointed by them.  I especially love the heated seats and steering wheel coming on automatically when the temps are really low.  I didn’t have a need for 3rd row seat, but I had to have a 6 cylinder engine after being underwhelmed by 4 cylinder cars in the past.  Unfortunately, V6 engines are getting harder to find in midsize cars and crossovers.  I’m not super impressed with the power of the V6 Cherokee’s engine climbing hills, so I can imagine the 4 must be sluggish. The controls for radio and heat/air need to be easier to operate while driving. There are buttons for controlling the temp but most of the controls are in the touchscreen which requires too much visual contact to fool with while driving. I would also recommend Jeep make the active drive setting default to off rather than on. Aside from those operational critiques, I love the fit and finish. The cabin is quiet and handling is great. It’s a fun car to drive."
"Homerun!  I love my Jeep Cherokee, it is everything I wanted!"
"GOOD JEEP  The car is very driver friendly. The cruise control is very responsive. If the passenger seat was identical to the driver's seat, the Jeep would have been great. After two long trips to Florida, we experienced a comfortable ride.  Highway mileage is great but city mileage is only fair."
"The V6 are good, at least.  I bought a 2018 Cherokee latitude. It's a mixture of great and disappointing. The look, interior, and base model features are above average. It looks good, the inside is spacious and comfortable, the Bluetooth connectivity and backup cam are nice semi-modern touches, and it's nice to sit it. Unfortunately, the engine is not great. The 2.4L V4 is sluggish, under powered, and frustrating. It's fine for basic commutes where you never go over 45mph. However, the car has no pep, no get-up-and-go, and at higher speeds, you really have to push it to pass slower cars on the freeway. I wouldn't recommend the V4 Jeep Cherokee models to anybody. Go V6 or leave the dealership. The V4s aren't Jeeps, they just look like them. Everything else in the car is nice, though."
"Nothing but junk!!!!!!  This is my 1st new car. I'm 41, and didn't know anything about credit when I was young. I suffered for that for a long time. I finally got into the position to get my something I really wanted. I've had it 12 days and today I had to put it in the shop. The trans is bad. Motor has lost horsepower. Bad vibrations and metal on metal grinding noises. I took it to the dealer where they said they can't get to it till the 1st of the week. They won't give me a loaner until they diagnose the problem. I have purchased many used Ford's and have always loved them, but now I wished I would have looked at challenger. Thanks ford for making my 1st new car experience a nightmare!"
"New Lat Plus- great so far  If you need the V6, you’re apparently off-road a lot in terrain or are a much more aggressive driver than I am commuting. I do 75-80 on the way to work (30 mi) and am averaging 27 mpg (80% hwy) with the 2.4 engine. RPMs sit right at 2,000 cruising, lower than the Escape and Sportage. If you need a comfortable, affordable vehicle, consider the 2.4 model and drive others to compare. 184 HP is plenty unless you want to tow >2,000 lbs or do 90 all the time. Also, trans is so smooth compared to ‘14-15 complaints. Love the 8.4 UConnect. Hope I get an easy 100k out of this Jeep as it’s far too early to assess reliability. So far though, my favorite vehicle of 7 I’ve owned since 2000 and the only truck, car, or SUV I’ve reviewed. $5,000+ in rebates made it an absolute no brained."
"Beyond expectations  I actual have the 3.2L V6 Limited 4X4 trim version with heated front leather seats and steering wheel, dual zone climate control, BSM, Rear cross-traffic alert, Back up sensors, back-up camera, and automatic start stop. It totally has went above and beyond my expectations, I was a bit hesitant at first with the 9 speed transmission cause I had rented a 200 when they first came out with 9 speed, but it’s great in the Cherokee. I love the styling mines white with the the black cladding, I blacked out all the Crome and dipped the rims black. Acceleration, comfort, driving aid and entertainment are all great, but one major thumbs down is there is still no apple car-play in an 18 come onnnn.  Would totally buy it again next the overland though."
"It's really a V-6  I put over 1,000 miles on it the first week.  Very good on the highway and not bad on city streets.  Compared to my 92 Wrangler with over 350,000 on the odometer this vehicle is a Limo.  I do find it odd that FCA left 2014 technology in the radio when even they step down vehicle Compass has the new radio."
"2018 Cherokee Overland - I'm in Love  Had a 2015 Cherokee Limited, and liked it, but the 18 Overland is a real winner.  Quieter, smoother, better seats.  And I love the safety tech and the way the 4x4 sits up on the road.  Happy, happy owner."
"Former Subaru owner  Look for a rust free example. I wanted one that was not molested. Minor things are worn out or broken,but no big deal. I have invested in a 4.5 inch lift kit as ALL the suspension was original and worn out. Gauges are a little twitchy but functional. MUCH more power than my Forester and more room also. I like the option of 2WD,Part time 4 WD,4 WD and 4WD low range. Went with the 4.5 lift to fit the 32/11.50-15 tires I bought for it. My son has been buying,fixing,selling and 4 wheeling these Jeeps for years and he finally talked me into one 3 weeks ago. Choice of parts is much larger compared to my subie. Now I just have to wait for a warmer day to install my stash of new parts (lift kit,turbo exhaust,brake upgrade to rear disc)"
"Love This Vehicle, But I Have So Many Issues  CHECK EVERYTHING! Run the A/C full blast while letting the vehicle idle and watch the temperature and oil pressure, as well as idle RPM. Check the AUX cooling fan to be sure it works, it doesn't come on until the engine reaches 218 degrees F. Check the valve cover, oil pan, and other gaskets and seals.  Check for corrosion on any part inside of the engine compartment as this could very well be a sign of potentially serious damage that will lead to expensive repairs. I paid $2500 for my Jeep in 2014, it is now worth about $1300 if I tried to resell it and I have put nearly $1500 into it in repairs with another $1000 for parts and labour just on the engine alone. Not to mention the horrible condition of the suspension, brakes, missing hardware, and quite a few other issues. But I do love the car enough to actually not mind all too much putting money into it because when I am done with all these repairs it will be one hell of a vehicle and last another 200000 miles."
"17-years and 339K miles  Purchased in 2001, this is the 3rd Jeep Cherokee owned and the best, as by 2001 the Cherokee had enjoyed purposeful improvements and technical upgrades.  Still on the original inline six engine and 4A transmission.  The 4.0 seems to tend to leak and this one started dripping oil (never measurable) at 170K, but initially a valve cover gasket solved the first occurrence.  Oil changes every 3k-5k miles.  The typical O2 and cam position sensors in first few years of service, but not since repaired.  A computer at 318K, and normal wear items as expected, including the AC compressor at 170K, radiator at 200K, heater core at 250K.  Brake rotor warping solved by mechanic's choice of replacements by 2003.  Lots of torque and smooth run at highway speeds.  Nimble in town.  Excellent stock solid axle 4WD capability.  Have driven through many on/off road conditions that stopped other vehicles.  Have been up to the axles in mud, up icy hills on the road when others stopped making headway, waded through flooded streets (safely) in bumper-deep water when others became stranded and pulled a make-shift plow to break up beaver dams in a creek.  Served as neighborhood taxi in snow/ice covered roads with steep hills - no problem with good street/trail tires.  Shifts in/out of 4WD easily.  It's not trouble-free but its performance and on/off road capability, great stock ground clearance, weight and overall reliability and ruggedness of the drivetrain always outweigh any issues.  Keep up with the maintenance, make repairs when needed and it should provide reliable, highly capable stock 4WD on/off road performance with reasonable operating expense.  Purchasing this year/model/configuration with well over 200K miles that has been maintained properly should not be a concern.  Parts are readily available and generally not too costly.  Abundant aftermarket parts/accessories.  Still on original paint/clear coat, carpet and seat covers, all of which are in remarkably good condition.  Still 17-19 mpg city, 20-25 mpg highway.  Still commuting 300+ miles/week.  Other than driver's door speaker, all other electrical items still function as when new."
"Great car in the snow!  My car is 15 years old now, with a lot of miles on it, and has lost some of its power going up in the mountains...acceleration power is limited..."
"Hi-N-Low desert runner  While I love my car, mine does not have cruise control. Since I live so far away from a metropolitan area, I need to travel a good distance to shop, and to get other services like medical, dental, cleaners, and food. It sometimes is hard to keep my speed down, as it wants to travel at speed, and I do not always want to do that. The speed limit out here in the desert is 65, but sometimes I find the speed creeping up to over 75!! So, I guess you must be vigilant to watch your speed out in the highways. I have had my Jeep for 13 years, and have over 120,000 miles, not ONE major repair, and I am able to do simple service easily like oil change, filters, air and transmission filters, even spark plugs. so my car has been absolutely trouble free. I am on my 3rd set of tires, and just replaced them last summer at over 48,000 miles! My three dogs love riding in it too!I also own a 2006 Jeep Wrangler, and I wish it were as trouble free."
"180000 miles great SUV until it was totalled   My Jeep Cherokee 2001 Sport 4 dr 4x4 was one dependable vehicle. It did need a radiator after like ten years and a new a/c compressor but other than those items it was just great. Really going to miss it. A driver went left of center and totalled it on my wife. The airbags went off, and she did not even get a scratchmy wife, the Jeep not so lucky front left fender , bumper, grill, wheel,suspension all took the hit.I would buy a new one if they still made them. Door still opened on driver side after the crash."
"Close but no cigar  Car is fun enough to drive, but having had the battery die twice in my garage, first time after owning it for two weeks, and again in June 09.  Auto feature on windows most times work fine, but often only work one way and not always the same way.  Air conditioning is poor most of the time.  Didn't work at all once, took it to the dealership- told it takes time to cool off - I guess an hour is not long enough when it's blowing hot air.  Next day it worked fine.  Wouldn't take it on a trip in hot weather.  Would not buy one again. Dealership charged me for an auto emission test, but not necessary if driven under 5000 miles in a year."
Great American Icon  Everybody loves this beautiful red Mustang with 2008 GT500 black stripes plus the black out option. Even Chevolet guys have made commits about how good the car looks. Kids love it.
"It was fun and real but not real fun  Bought a 2001 jeep cherokee classic 4x4 with 15k miles on it and was pleased with it but in a middle of the road way. It was very reliable and durable but it was a jeep. Every one had one at the time and you couldn't pick kit out in a parking lot. It was loud and rough riding (I know it wasn't made for comfort) but in an kidney bursting way. Don't get me wrong it was a great car that never gave me trouble and was fare offroad but being a car guy I could never really like it enough to the point I loved to drive it or wanted to keep it. When we sold it the family didn't even blink, when we sold the hummer h3 my son cried and kissed it on the fender and said we will miss you lol. "
"Perfect on all counts!  When I ran into this car on a lot with 140k on the counter, I had no hesitation. I know several people sitting at well over 300k still driving them daily, and they are not the most maintenance minded people in the world. I bought my jeep as a car to park at the airport every week when I travel for work, but have quickly found myself driving it more than my brand new silverado or my wife's Lexus. With the farmer's almanac predictions for this winter on the east coast I absolutely can't wait to take this billy goat out playing in the snow on the way to go snowboarding.If you find one regardless of the miles buy it fast, it will last forever and is easy to fix on the rare chance it breaks. "
"Dream vehicle-Ol' Blue  11 years old and deserves a garage and to take a break from the St. Louis summer heat.This is the best vehicle I will ever own.Its only downside is the a/c which is why I bought another car to tag team the seasons.Since 2001, I have replaced the evap core, compressor and engine thermostat (just to be on the safe side, problem cleared).I just don't care that I blew the front speakers and time did its thing to the headliner.The original battery lasted more than 6 years.The back brakes are original at 73k.Nothing is better than driving this car in any situation, any terrain.I haven't shoveled snow in my driveway for 11 yrs.Independence and laziness at its finest."
Best choice for a second vehicle or fun toy.  I have had company vehicles for a long time and in 2011 lost my job and wheels due to this recession.I needed to buy a vehicle. I needed the price low enough i could pay cash. it needed to be reliable and not prone to engine or trans work. I have been a jeep fan for a while. owned two grand cherokee with no major problems.Anyway so I decided on the old school cherokee because I love its looks. its known for rock solid inline 6 cylinder 4.0L and solid transmission.any smaller problems i will fix myself with the help of the many cherokee fan forums. trust me these guys know everything and are very willing to lend a hand. this is the best bargain out there.
"The engine may outlast me!  This is the second Cherokee I've owned. The first was an '87 that lasted 250k and would've gone longer had I not gotten water in the engine. For this reason, I decided to get a new one in 2000 (2001 model) and have not regretted it. The inline, cast iron, 6 cylinder engine will last a lifetime!Things to look for; The rear main oil seal will leak at some point (both of mine happened around 100k miles), it's a gas guzzler, the valve cover will leak at some point (easy/cheap DIY), though my 2001 has yet to do this (140k), and the front rotors warp easily. I replaced my rotors with cross-drilled rotors that last longer, stop faster and cost less than OEM.very reliable vehicle!"
Champion  i bought my Jeep in July 2011 with 170k on the dash. The only thing I've done to this car is give it 4 oil changes. I've taken this car from Charleston SC to Winston Salem NC several times and also to and from Brooklyn NY from Charleston with no problems. I bought the car with low oil pressure but this has not slowed this beast down. I'm a heavy driver and this jeep hangs in there with me.One of the bet buys of my life. 
"What a mess  Worst vehicle ive ever owned. bought it with 72k for 10k in 2005 110k now. no kidding i have never had this truck 100 percent since the day i drove it off the lot. its always been something. hood cable 5X window regulators 10x valve cover gasket, oil adapter gasket.evap coil 2x. wheel bearing 3x. leaks water from every gasket. oil from every gasket. electrical system is falling apart. Not to mention its terrible on gas. have to be in 4x4 to make it thru a 1/4 inch of snow. 4wd indicator switch 8x and the new one just broke. this jeep is so piss poor i bought a 2006 mazda because i didnt trust the jeep and the mazda is no good!! yet another bad dicision the jeep forced me to make. "
"Reliable  I just turned over 200,000 miles and I have only changed the oil about 15 times. My Cherokee Sport still runs strong and if I had been a bit better with maintenance I believe it would easily turn 300k. If you find one of these gems don't be afraid of it if it has some miles on it you will easily see 200k. My mechanic says these engines are bullet proof, and the only reason he has seen it is for the 3 radiators it has gone through. We have recently endured a terrible snow storm that downed many trees, my Jeep got me home safe with some of the nastiest four wheel off roading it has been through!"
Will be buried in it....  At 45 I feel very COOL driving it. Was lucky to pick one up in 2009 with only 29K miles on it. It still looks and drives like new at 50K now. In bad weather I volunteer to run to the store as an excuse to drive it. I would really love to buy another one someday but as we know that's not going to happen. 
"It's a Jeep  Owned a 97 VW Jetta before this that was fun to drive. This Jeep is fun, but in a different way. For a vehicle with 15 in rims it goes over just about anything, is tough as nails, and I know that I can count on it to get me practically anywhere. It's not the most comfortable thing in the world, but that's just part of Jeep's purpose. My Cherokee actually has more horizontal room than a Liberty, and is definitely built more solid. Gas mileage is horrible (my vw got 26, this gets around 18), but it's well worth it for the experience of driving a legendary SUV. "
"2017 Mustang Air Conditioning weak  I shouldn't be having Air Conditioning problems with such a new car and under 7,000 miles. My air conditioning went out and I took it to the dealer. They said it would be 2 to 3 days before they could get to it. Cars brought in on Monday and Tuesday were ahead of me and they were backed up. They never offered me a rental car until I spoke to the service manager and he checked to see what extended coverage protection I had. Fortunately I had the Extended service protection plan and so I qualified for a free rental car. No one would volunteer that information. Only after I pressed did they finally admit that I was due a rental car. They called Enterprise for me. So I am expecting my car to be in the shop for at least a week. The computer screen is also shutting off and restarting as we drive and the Blutooth disconnects during calls randomly. We love the car but the dealership is hard to work with and these small problems can be fixed...... Hopefully"
Great car  Good car. Runs well. Have more than enough space. Have had 4 boards and 4 people in the car at once. Have been able to put 10 boards in the car. 
"Love it  I bought the 2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport because we needed to replace a 2nd car and it was a good deal. The plan was for me to drive it to work and back 5 miles one way. I LOVE IT!!  Couldn't be happier!  Fun to drive, very reliable, just right!  We'll keep the Jeep forever."
"Love Love  Have always admired the shape of this car since I was a kid. I love how long lasting they are and how when something needs maintenance, it is easy to do yourself and cheap!"
"Yellow won't die  2Dr/4WD Cherokee, commutes 200km daily and goes trail riding on weekends. Does a long paper route once a week and takes three dogs out and about. 4.0L engine just keeps on ticking and she just turned 310,500km on odo, I figure she's good till 500,000km. "
"Get one and you'll want to keep it forev  My 2001 Sport 4dr 2wd was my daily driver for the past 6 years. I now have a more fuel-efficient car for daily driving and the Cherokee is a ""spare"" vehicle. But I couldn't justify selling it. It's just too dependable, low-maintenance and useful. Even with 150k miles on the drivetrain, it runs like new, never misses a beat and doesn't leak anything at all. It's a bit noisy and gets horrible fuel mileage in city driving (around 17 mpg) and only 24-25 mpg highway. But it's got torque to haul a lot, ground clearance to go anywhere, tons of cargo room (plus a roof rack) and is easy to drive in any weather, on any roads. I just got back from a trip (920 miles each way) at mostly 75 mph, no problem"
"Great Jeep  I bought my Jeep on 2004. This is awesome. No major maintenance except normal wear and tear. The engine is awesome. I have 128,000 mile on it so far. Looks like my coolant is leaking but these things are fixable. The bottom line is Engine which is awesome. I love Inline 6.  This is a little monster in the snow. I am not kidding. Its a part time 4 wheel drive. when it snows, put it to 4 wheel and there you go, you will fly leaving all the cars and SUVs behind."
"super car  This is my 3rd Cherokee and loved them all. I've had this for 9 years and it runs fantastic. Nothing but oil, tires and brakes in all these years. Off road it totally kicks. It is nimble, quick, engineered very well for its purpose. It is just a very lively and capable JEEP. I expect it to last many more years. "
89 and 270k and going  Cubans should buy this jeep.  It will be around as long as the 50's cars they drive now and it will be alot nicer.  I like keeping things that don't get abandoned by the rest of the rest!  We still can buy parts no problem for a jeep 20 yrs old.  do as done
"keep jeep'in  i drive this hard had little problems only air compressor locked up,but for over the many years had not had to lay a finger on it "
"Nothing else like it  I bought my XJ almost a year ago. After selling my 88 F250(needed cash) and GMC 2500(horrible truck!). I have put 35,000+ on the truck in under a year I drive about 45 minutes to work everyday. I also take the truck off roading dozens of times a month for hours at a time. It has a 4.5 inch RC lift and handles better off road then my friends vehicles by far a wrangler, bronco and samurai. I've put it through hell and back and never been stuck or had any maintenance issues. I'm 19 years old and I plan to keep it forever. It turns my 31 inch tires with all the added weight from the new heavy duty leaf springs and coil I installed. LOVE IT    "
"2017 Mustang GT/Performance Package  The Performance package stffins the suspension a lot to the point of a very bumpy ride on roads that are not real smooth. The ride is liveable if your expecting it, so if you are looking for a Touring ride, the performance package is not for you. The 6speed manual is a little disappointing. It clunks when shifting into gears from a stop, and is very notchy thru the upshifts. Ford says this is a normal action with the manuals, so beware when selecting a manual transmission. As expected the fuel economy is averageing 12mpg, with the 5.0 so don't complain about the lousy mileage. The GT handles very well with the GT package and steering response and brake response is excellent. Otherwise a nice package and I would buy it again but in the future I may opt for the new 10spd auto transmission which was not available in 2017."
"Tires, Battery, Belt, Shocks, Brakes   I have 170,000 miles on the Cherokee - it had 32 when I bought it. I am on tire set 5, shocks set 3, belt 3, battery 4, brakes 5. I've replaced the plugs three times, the valve cover gasket once, serviced the differentials twice each. Oil changes every 5 to 7000 miles, (in spite of what is recommended). One radiator. Bulbs and headlights and what-have- you: once or twice. The worst repair was the air, once, $1300, and how bad is that, really? I doubt I've put more than $6000 into it over the many miles, about 1/6 th of which were off-roadish, it has carried me. If your Cherokee hasn't done the same, I don't think you put enough love into it. Jeep owners will understand this."
"Low Maintnance and durable  Purchase my jeep used with 70k miles in 2004.  It now has 122k miles and drives and runs no different than the day I bought it.  Only maintenance I have done is change oil, change transmission fluid(once), replace rear shocks (once), and a brake job (once).  Jeep has plenty of power and will easily do 100mph.  It is durable and handles great in the snow.  It can go offroad anywhere 98% of people would need / want to go.  I wish it were a little quieter on the road and go better gas mileage (but you can't avoid the fact that it is a box on wheels and about as non-aerodynamical as a car could be)."
I love reading the Jeep reviews  Four Cherokee's....I'd buy four more. '84 ( black beauty } '93 ( black beauty II } '98 { green hornet )'01 { Brutis ). Brutis pulled a new Kia SUV with a tow package and a 2300 lb sterndrive boat hat was coupled to it out of our lake and up the ramp. And I didn't have to bother with low range! Enough said. 
My Jeep  I bought my jeep Cherokee Sport 3yrs. ago and never had any problems with so far and it has 140000 mi. on it.It is a great vehicle for off roading to get to my fav. fishin/campin/hunting spots here in PA..fuel economy is getting better with a Gibson Perf. exhaust and a K&N cold air intake and I just added a BBK 62 mm. throttle.There is so many mods. that you can add to this vehicle. that makes it so fun to own. Looks are great for town and off roading to.
"Nothing Like It  There is nothing like the Jeep Cherokee.  I bought my Jeep with ~50,000 miles on it back in 2004.  It rides rough, but this rugged vehicle was bult to last.  After driving it over 60,000 miles I have had to replace the AC condenser, tires, battery, and brake rotors (my Fault).  Nothing else has been replaced.  I have hauled almost 1000 lbs of crap in the back of it at one time.  I still love Charolette (my Jeep)."
"Great Jeep...  I have 175,000 miles on my jeep and nothing is slowing it down. I have had some recent repairs due to wearable items and had some issues with the check engine light. Really...the best vehicle I have ever purchased. I am sure it will last to 200,000 miles and beyond. The back seat could have more room, but it fits my daughters car seat and toys just fine. It is a great off roading vehicle. It has one of the only true SUV off-roading suspensions. I love it."
"Amazing SUV  This vehicle is amazing. I have owned two Jeeps, a 1991 Jeep Wrangler and this one; both with the 4 litre I6. But also, i'm still 16 so there will be plenty more to come. This Jeep does everything. It drives great, looks great, and is super comfortable. The engine is truly bullet proof. I was happily surprised with the amount of power it puts out, great for an suv. This little thing will go anywhere and do anything. Living in the northwest and having these winters are nothing for it. I can haul plenty of people and plenty of gear. My friends and i love it."
"my race truck  This truck is possibly the greatest vehicle of all time. It's fast (took off the restrictor plate and got it doing 125 mph). Its small and handles beautifully if your idea of beauty is a roll over waiting to happen at every turn, mine is. The small size does not bother me because I'm not a big guy but people in the backseat complain, they know where the door is. My Jeep has around 187,000 miles. And I drive this thing hard from offroading to the occasional street race. Guys with there little rice burner toyotas laugh at the start then I hit them with the incredible torque! The Jeep Cherokee should have been in diehard because it is unstoppable. Except for the a/c compressor it died at 100k miles"
"Love / Hate Relationship  I bought this Jeep used w/ 40K miles on it for my kids.  5 years later it has 70K miles.  I have spent a fortune replacing parts on this.  Both front and rear differentials, ball joints, radiator, water pump,and more.  Check engine light is on again.   Probably another $250 part needed. It is a solid feeling truck that is fun to drive.  The seats need more support. I keep hoping the last repair will be it, and that it is good to go for many more miles and years.  I've got too much invested in it now to unload it. Maybe the prior owner abused it and I am paying the price.  My luck has been nothing like those of the other reviewers. "
"Bring back the cherokee  My 2001 is my second Cherokee. I bought a new 1994 when Chrysler rumors came out that it would be discontinued. The 2001 was the last year, so i bought a 2001 Cherokee classic. My daughter has a 2000 and my son has a 1998. The Cherokee was a classic well built utilitarian vehicle. I love the visibility, 4x4 ability and the dependability.   "
"affordable little pocket rocket  My wife and I were wanting a second vehicle for errand running and pleasure rides. I had mustangs in the past and she really liked the styling and the suprising comfort of the premium models seating. I am a retired senior master Ford technician and can vouch for the fact that these cars are rarely in the shop for any issues. The git-up-and go factor is definitely there. Amazing performance. Super comfortable. Fuel mileage for ours is overall at 27 mpg. I would recommend the ecoboost premium model to anyone. Be prepared for a lot of ""cool car"" comments."
"Reliable and affordable  I bought this 2001 Cherokee Sport almost 4 years ago as a solution to the bad winters here in Michigan. I chose well. This is a wonderfully capable off road vehicle with good ground clearance. It plows through the snow, sometimes pushing the snow with the bumper when it gets deep. There is a lot of power with the 4.0 inline 6 which snaps your head back when you want to play at the lights. It handles well on tight curves and despite it's classification as an SUV it doesn't have that vague steering I have noticed on other SUVs. The styling has been called boxy but I love it and consider it classic. It has never had a problem since I have owned it, just the routine maintenance so far. "
"My prayer was answered  I could not leave this site without commenting. My jeep was stolen last week and I only prayed that I would get it back, not totalled. My prayer was answered! I am a 67 year old grandmother who takes her grandkids (and friends)everywhere.  Seven years of car seats and kids in and out, no problem.  I cannot imagine having to replace this vehicle, at least not anytime soon.  I would have had to find another 2001 Cherokee Sport if need be! Have never had any major problems, which I attribute to proper maintenance.  Love My Jeep!   "
"great little jeep    This is my 4th jeep cherokee, and I guess my last one since they quit making them.  I love it.  It powers up hills, flies past the slow moving vehicles on passing opportunities.  When I had a toyota there was no passing allowed, it didn't have enough umhph.  But cherokees, no problem.  Its great off-road, its small dimensions are perfect for tight hairpin turns on narrow, steep dirt roads.  And all my jeeps have been extremely reliable.  nothing has gone wrong on them and I drove each one till 130,000 miles."
"Jeeps are my life  I have owned 5 Jeeps. 83 cj7, 88 Wrangler, 2-91 Cherokees, and this 01 Cherokee. They all had the inline six cyl. motors. Good rugged vehicles. I plowed with the cj and wrangler and they held up good. The Cherokees are good cars but they all seem to have issues around the 100000 mile mark. I have learned from the past to just bite the bullet and put radiators in them at the 100 grand mark. They are not that good on gas (maybe 21 to 23 on a trip)but I still keep buying them..LOL They are good in the snow climate up here in the northeast. This 2001 Cherokee has had synthetic oil changes since new so we will so how long I can run this without getting the usual compression blow by."
"junk  I just got this jeep and let me tell you it stinks! No power no good off road capabilities. Worst of all no room. I have a family of 4 and none of us are liking it. Im going back to my chevy Avalanch more room, power and better fuel milage."
"Great Jeep  Amazing Jeep. I have had it for 2 years and have had no mechanical problems, with the exception of a faulty check engine light. I take it off roading and it handles like a dream in snow and rain. There is limited head room, but the front seats are exceptionally comfy (especially with the seat heaters). Not great gas mileage, but you don't buy an SUV expecting great mileage. I would highly recommend this Jeep to anyone who wants a reliable workhorse of a vehicle. By far the most reliable and versatile vehicle that Jeep has ever come out with. I wish they'd bring them back!"
"Great Buy For the Money  I recently purchased my used, 2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport with 67,300 miles on it.  So far, it is exactly what I  expected, a solid, 4x4, SUV that is great for daily driving.  My other vehicle is a 2005 Cadillac STS that I use if I want to have a luxury sport ride.  Although it had passed State Inspection, I immediately had some upgrades installed.  I had 5 brand new Firestone Destination A/T tires installed, a catback, Borla exhaust system, a heavy duty Interstate 7 year battery, a full set of 4 KYB heavy duty gas shocks and a new heavy duty steering dampener.  Everything else was ""good to go"" and passed State inspection.  I enjoy driving it locally every day.  My wife enjoys it also."
"This Jeep is a Champ  Chrysler totally blew it when they discontinued this model in a pathetic attempt to court the soccer mom set. They have yet to produce anything even close and now they are looking for a government hand out? That 4.0, 6 cylinder is rock solid and has plenty of power. The is a simple vehicle that any mechanic and most back yard tinkers can work on. I use mine for commuting, back country trout fishing, beach driving and towing my boat. It has over 120k miles(just a pup) and it has cost me almost nothing in repairs. I have owned a Trooper, 4Runner and a Grand Cherokee. This little SUV beats them all hands down. Wake up Chrysler give us back our real Cherokee and maybe you'll even turn a profit."
"The Brute  I bought my 4WD Cherokee for one reason, no other small or midsize SUV at the time or now had the reputation and ability to pull my 23 ft saltwater walk-around fishing boat and tandem axle trailer.  After 6 plus years of yeoman like duty, hauling that boat on trips as long as 1100 miles. I've replaced the radiator, water pump and a u-joint in 150K miles. It's amusing to slip into 4Wheel High on a wet boat ramp and walk up the ramp while larger pickups and SUVs spin their tires hooked to smaller boats.  I wish they still made them and because I don't I won't be getting rid of mine anytime soon.  It's a little Brute!"
"tank  I'm 16 and got this car for my first. It has 137,000 on it an other than flushing all the fluids this thing is a tank and it just cant be stopped. Winter is coming up which should be fun to see how it handles."
"Blue Pony  I bought a used 2017 Mustang with the V6 engine and low mileage.  I’ve been very pleased.  The car is beautiful, and it’s ride, acceleration and handling are excellent.  The V6 has 300 hp and moves the car effortlessly.  It also has a throaty roar when you press down on the accelerator.  It is a sports car with a firm suspension, so it’s not the plush, soft ride of an Accord/Camry.  But braking, handling and acceleration are excellent."
"One sweet SUV !!  I have owned and absolutely cherished my Cherokee Limited 4WD. It is the best suv I have owned in my lifetime. It's performance has been top notch. There were two recalls for heat shields that came and went without a hitch. I knew that the jeep tranny was clunky when I bought it. The 4wd engage is also clunky but after 7 years I have gotten used to it. I don't off-road but I have been in some raging winter weather in the New Mexico mountains and it has sailed through like the champ it is. My first set of tires lasted 80,000 miles and I have 27,000 on my second set with no issues to date. The bun warming seats are terrific. Can't beat a Cherokee. Can't imagine why they stopped producing them. "
"Great Jeep  Bought this 2001 Cherokee Sport with 82K, and it was a great vehicle to own. Drove great through snow and mud, but also had a smooth highway ride. Engine provided plenty of power, however was also very thirsty. A very well-built, reliable Jeep. "
"The best vehicle ever built  I love my Cherokee.  I fell in love with it the second that I saw it on the dealership lot.  I surf so it's a lot fun to drive, especially on the beach.  It can take anything that I throw at it and what I need it to do.  It is the best vehicle that I have ever had.  I'm gonna keep it until it dies, even with today's gas prices.  Chrysler needs to bring this Jeep back and sell it again."
"A rare right hand drive Cherokee  I found my Cherokee on the side of the road for sale. It is a factory right hand drive. Aside from replacing nearly all of the original parts (previous owners were not proactive in taking care of the vehicle), it is a very durable vehicle. I use this vehicle daily to carry mail and it is stronger than the government owned vehicles. It has twice the power. The only downside to the 4.0 is the poor gas mileage. Overall, this is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned. The best I have ever owned was a 1984 Honda Accord."
"Watching our Cherokee mature  When we bought it, I had the OEM oil changed to Mobil One. Then I had the transmission and differential changed to Mobil One at 25,000 miles. As near as I can remember, it runs just like the day I drove it off the lot, which is a day I have not regretted so far. To date, the only ""major"" issue I have had was a failure of the crankshaft and camshaft sensors to the tune of $400. The mechanic seems to have taken me some, as the camshaft sensor was obviously broken but the chances of both failing at once are infinitesimal. Otherwise it has been good to us. Strong, quick, and reliable, it inspires confidence in any traffic, weather or road condition, and looks great doing it."
"good old jeep  Me and my husband got this Jeep after I drove on of his buddy's jeeps. I like his and wanted one. This Jeep has been good to us. Just the normal repairs. We bought it used with 43,000 miles. Good power, goes in snow and mud. I would like to get a brand new one if I could. We have 105,000 miles and it still is going strong. "
"Stil the best   bought this in '05 with 40K on it in showroom new shape , added air raid cold air induction & t/b spacer to up horsepower and save gas (when i could keep from gunning it..WOW) always wanted one and when i finally got it just couldn't get enough. Most people don't get the chance to put a daily driver 4wd to the test but I made sure i did and this vehicle took everything from 3 ft snow drifts to 2ft deep flooded areas like a champ. Make sure you keep up the maintenance and you'll be perfect. Oh and you gotta love that Jeep finally changed the liberty for '08 to look like a modern Cherokee, guess they do listen ;o)"
Jeeperz  Best all around car. Fun on and off road. it's one of three Jeeps we have. I got it with 80K miles and drive it hard.  Easy to fix up with many upgrades I can go any where my son goes in his Rubicon
"Once you go Jeep, you never go steep.  I've had my Jeep now for about a year and I've put on about 20k miles on it.  Bought it at 71k miles, it's got 91k on it now.  I had to replace the radiator and the TPS sensor.  Radiator was cracked before I bought it evidently due to all of the stop leak in it when I took it out.  Other than that, this thing has been a dream.  The family loves it, it's very roomy, reliable, and so comfortable to drive.  For not being a full-size vehicle, you feel like you are in command of the road and plus you aren't taken over by the thing either like a full-size.  It laughs at any bad weather condition too.  I will be keeping this Jeep for a very long time."
"Best Truck Ever!  I waited years for a Jeep.  Wanted A Wrangler, but I am a professional guitarist, and needed the interior room for my gear. I have had this Jeep almost two years now, and have very few complaints. It kills off- road, kills in the snow, and will track through deep mud almost like it's on dry pavement.  Handles great on the highway too, although high winds can be an adventure. At over 100,000 miles, it still runs incredibly strong. I regularly take it on long road trips without a second thought. It tends to chew up tires, it's loud, not real cushy, and the fuel economy could be better, but hey, it's a 4WD truck, not a luxury vehicle. I plan to drive it until it croaks or I do."
"Too many issues  I was love everything about 2017 Mustang GT and I make it mine but I will regret forever and I can’t wait to get rid of it. It’s a lot of people on You Tube (myself included) with engine knock/ticking noises and FORD dealers they just can’t help it, exterior panels firmest it’s horrible and interior panels they rattles everywhere. The engine noises starts at around 7000 miles and now I have a little over 10.000 miles and it’s worse (you can check many videos on You Tube). I had at least 8 sport cars and never had any engine knock on them. Invest your hard work money in differit brands. The 2015 2017 Mustang looks fantastic but nothing else, it’s piece of crap."
"Like it a lot!  I bought mine used with 50,000 miles on it. I have since put another 50,000 on and still going strong. I have had no major repair the normal brakes tires etc. I do need to replace the clutch on the air conditioner compressor that is it. I was thinking about a new car but mine is in such nice shape I think I will keep it a year or two."
"Mediocre at Best  I had to have the transmission replaced after 6 years.  Of course, I could be dealing with a dishonest repair shop. Chronic problem with number 3 misfire, rattling, drive train seems to clunk in rear and under shifter. I am not rough on the car, I do not off road, but I do use the car off road occasionally for hunting, fishing, or snowy conditions."
"grows on you  This is my first Jeep. And I love it. Once you get past the poor gas mileage and lack of creature comforts you realize this is a workhorse SUV meant to take whatever you dish out every day. I do whatever I want with it. Fish, hunt, urban cruising, snow, rain, dirt, etc. I even commute in it. The engine light is annoying but I just consider it an old friend now who comes to visit from time to time. A easy and FREE trip to any auto parts store gets you a free computer reading that tells you to relax about the engine light. Very useful for moving refrigerators, dogs, military gear, bikes, kids, canoes, wood, etc. Easy to clean, easy to dirty. FUN, cheap and reliable. "
"Not bad  My 2001 Jeep Cherokee works just fine. I have a slight shimmy at 50 MPH but that may because of some bad wheels. I needed to have my AC rebuilt (70k) and I needed an expensive brake job (60k). The power steering sprung a leak ($400 at 60k). Besides that, it's OK."
"A Love Affair That Won't Go Away  The 2001 Cherokee has been an excellent mid-sized SUV for family trips and for my wife to carry the grandchildren in around town. It handles very well in the city, is easy to park and can easily handle large loads of luggage or bagged mulch. The decision to stop making the Cherokee can only be equated to the decision some years ago to stop making real Coke. It was a bad decision and all of the Cherokee owners I have talked to have agreed. Wake up Jeep and put the Cherokee back in production with a diesel engine. "
"Excellent Jeep.   I've always loved Jeeps. I bought this Jeep from our local Toyota dealership back in 2003. I just couldn't resist this Jeep classic. It's been such a wonderful vehicle to own. Never had any problems with it. The engine is a bit loud, compared to other SUVs. But it's not, really. It's the typical Jeep Cherokee sound. And the torque on this thing is tremendous!  I got the Limited model. The interior has a nice, clean layout. The heated leather front seats are excellent during winter. Great sounding stereo.  This is our weekend ride. We take it for nice, long leisurely drives, always confident that we can to anywhere and back in our Jeep. "
"Great All-Purpose Rider  So far I've had no problems mechanically with this car. I've taken it off-road and it handles nicely, while on-road is even better. In general, for a vehicle with this kind of mileage (+50000) it's in good shape. It does have some problems, though. When 4 wheel drive high range is engaged, if you make a sharp turn the wheels lock. Also, when put in reverse for too long, it sometimes stalls or sputters. You need to find the right kind of tires, too. Wet handling is below average, even with 4WD. The vehicle corners well for an SUV and has a good turn radius, just make sure it's not cornering heavily above 50mph. At speeds above 80 on a straightaway highway, it becomes very shaky."
"Works for me  Bought to fill light hunting/skiing duty in New Mexico. Gets 17 around town (light foot), and about 21 on the highway in hilly/mountainous country.  I coast a lot down hill and keep the speed down to 70 max. Have three kids; a bit cramped in hip room in back seat.  Front ample for me, rear leg room OK if I pull the front seats forward a bit. With rear seat down, dog, guns, gear, etc. fit nicely.  Rides fine.  Have put 10,000 miles on it since I bought it (total 56,000) with only the standard oil/filter/lube.  Easy for this very non-mechanical person to work on. I would recommend for anyone who needs a good four person small SUV that has SUPERB off road capability and adequate in town manners."
"great little truck  This is about the most practical and best built, simple and tough vehicle I have ever owned. It has been through a lot of tough torture at Lake Meade and handles the desert like a champ. On our second weekend at the lake we were unpleasantly stuck about 5 miles from a road and had to be towed up a cliff by cable to get out. After a short bath and a new ball joint she was beautiful as always. The look with the chrome wheel skins is great and they are quickly replaced if scratched or lost for only $25.00 The paint is very rich and the truck still looks brand new at 50,000 miles.  I highly recommend to used buyers; remember though it is a truck based vehicle from the 80's. Don't expect a race car."
"The real thang  This vehicle is the best I have ever owned. It's a kick to drive, has a classic, handsome style that stands out more as new models of SUVs get weirder and weirder. I wish I had waited for a 4X4, but my wife had to have our gunmetal blue Cherokee. Backseat passengers tend to complain on long trips, but hey, it's not about them is it? We put an awesome sound system in it, and use Mobil One synthetics in the oil, tranny and differential. We change oil every 3,000, and the boy runs like the day we drove it off the lot (now at 102,000). So far, it has been Uber Reliable. This weekend I fixed the problem with the oxidation of the exterior plastic trim. We plan to keep this one forever."
"2017 Mustang Ecoboost Premium  Great looking, fun to drive.  Excellent gas mileage with great pick up. My favorite car of all time."
"GREAT SUV  I put this SUV through its paces and it just amazes me. Great look, reliability and performance for the Northeast. Too bad they discontinued this line and style. I'm keeping this SUV until the sport Cherokee comes back. "
"BEST Jeep SUV Ever Built!  I have always wanted this model Jeep. The Liberty is just plain UGLY!  Very hard to find a used one with less than 100K on it. Most people who own them want to keep them. Just love to drive it, whenever I can pry it away from my wife. Mine is loaded, leather, heated front seats, Infinity AM/FM/CD/Cassette along with all the standard Limited equipment."
"the funnest toss-about ever  This is one of the most fun vehicles I've driven. With secure on road handling and ""go anywhere"" capability it shows you what a Jeep is all about."
"LOVE the exterior but unreliable  I bought my car new in 2001 (Jeep Cherokee Sport).  I still LOVE the look of the exterior and it's great in the snow. I thought I would keep it forever for that reason.  However, it is 4 years old now and we have had to bring it in 4 times in the past 9 months to get it fixed, totaling over $2500. The AC compressor blew out and had to be replaced.  The brakes have already had to be replaced several times and the engine light seems like it's always on regardless of how many times we've brought it in.  I'm really disappointed but I think we have to sell it now because we simply can't afford it anymore.  If you take into account our repair bills over the past year, our monthly payment has been >$600/month ...ugh!"
"I hate this car  This is my 5th Jeep Vehicle. Bought all of them new. The first four were great very reliable and very few if any problems. This one has been a nightmare! 3 warranty issues which all required multi day visits to dealers with in one case my dealer having the car for 5 weeks. This vehicle constantly breaks. Electronic issues, misfiring engine, failed engine mount and now a blown radiator. In addition to paying for the car and regular maintenance I’ve spent countless hours at the dealer for warranty work and many thousands on unexpected failures. I’ve owned 7 new cars in the last 20 years and this vehicle is by far the worst! I will never again even consider buying a Jeep brand vehicle"
"worst car ever  This Jeep is my third jeep and I am extremely disappointed. I have owned a Wrangler, Jeep Grand Cherokee and now this trailhawk. I feel like each Jeep I own, there are more and more issues that plague these vehicles.  Most recently I have a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk, since acquiring this, it has required a new transmission (under 20,000). This vehicle also required some other work (which slips my mind at the moment) that was done six months outside of the 3-year warranty. The cost was roughly $2700, thankfully Mopar refunded the majority of costs. I thought this should take care of everything but it is turning into a nightmare of a money pit. I have also had to replace brake pads, rotors in the last few months, the passenger rear handle came off I still need to order a new handle and have it installed but haven’t had the opportunity, so I have been avoiding using this door.  On occasion my tailgate won’t close, I usually have to unplug the battery in order to reset this issue or google a quick fix. 2 weeks ago, I needed to replace the battery because my car wouldn’t start while visiting family, one of the connectors needed to be replaced at this time as well. The final straw has been finding out today that the ball joints need to be replaced. I understand that repairs sometimes need to happen and there is always routine maintenance, but this is excessive. I spend a significant amount of time without my vehicle and spending a lot of money for a car that is about 4 years old. I feel with the issues I feel extremely disappointed at the number of repairs and issues that are occurring and am looking to get a new vehicle when I was hoping this would last a couple more years. I feel that it is quite ridiculous to have to invest so much time and money in renting cars, seeking diagnosis for a relatively newer vehicle, and have never needed to bring in a car so much. This vehicle has become a laughing matter among my friends, family and coworkers. I am embarrassed that I am having so many issues and I wish there was a better warranty, or another option besides getting a different vehicle."
"My Latitude with Attitude  This 2014 Jeep Latitude has outperformed my expectations...in all areas.  Other than oil changes- I haven't had any servicing issues- Extremely reliable and dependable.  Great for all age groups/demographics . My driving is mostly highway - the experience has been great - safety, sound, and sublime!!! I highly recommend!"
"Power pkg SUV  We love the Jeep. The V6 is powerful especially in Sport Mode, 4x4 is rugged. Inside and out is comfortable and stylish with utility built in, many storage places, tow hooks, all weather package etc.  The back however is small for loading any large gear. Acceleration at times takes gearing a few seconds to engage so making intersections hairy. A whistling noise was a costly repair not covered under warranty. A solid Jeep!"
"Poor Reliability  As a previous reviewer also stated, I really wanted to like this vehicle.  After owning a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Latitude for nearly four years, I grew to resent it.  My family only owns one vehicle, so it must be reliable.  Nobody enjoys car problems and when you only own one-vehicle car problems can become even more stressful.  I will try to provide fair input in this review, as there are things to like about the Cherokee.  However, its reliability became a major issue for my family.    When I purchased the vehicle, I knew it was the first time Jeep implemented the 9-speed transmission.  In hindsight, it was probably not a good idea to buy a vehicle with such a new feature that had not been tested.  After buying the Cherokee, I noticed some owners mentioning harsh shifts on forums.  I noticed some harsh shifts from time to time, but nothing too bad.  I saw some forum users state they had dealerships reprogram their transmission, but the update had to be followed-up by an adaptive learning procedure by the dealership (the manual does state this).  I contacted the dealership I have my Jeep serviced at and while they were familiar with the update, they seemed to know nothing about the adaptive learning procedure.  As a result, I opted not to have them do the update, as I knew they would not complete the required follow-up procedure.   After about 2 ½ - 3 years, I noticed a whining sound when shifting from 4th to 5th gear.  The car did not jerk or anything, but it did not seem right.  At about the 3-½ year mark, I began to notice the same sound when completing a higher shift.  Since it was spreading I knew it was probably a bad sign.  Also, the shifting became more and more jerky.  My wife and I would tell others it was jumpy, and a little unsettling at times.At about the 3-½ year mark, my wife got stranded running errands when the Jeep suddenly would not start.  Ultimately, we had to have the vehicle towed to a dealership and have the starter replaced.  Of course the 3-year warranty had expired months earlier, so we had the pleasure of paying around $800 for the fix.  Last week, we noticed the odometer flashing.  The odometer would just flash from the moment you turned on the vehicle until you turned it off.  Considering the transmission getting progressively worse, the starter replacement, and now the odometer issue I brought up the idea of buying a new vehicle, as we could not rely on the Jeep.  We were planning on waiting for a bit, but days later my wife ran an errand.  When she came home, she said the Jeep had some really harsh shifts and almost to the point where she felt it would stall.I subsequently decided to immediately trade-in the Jeep for a new Ford Explorer.  The next morning I took off work so we could head to a Ford dealership.  Now the check engine light was on!  We headed to the Ford dealership and traded-in our Jeep and bought a new Explorer.  We did not get a great trade-in value as the dealership saw the flashing odometer, check engine light, and noticed the whining sound on at least one shift.  We had planned on keeping the Jeep for 7-8 years.  We ended up getting rid of it after 3 years and 10 months of ownership.  Things were just getting worse and worse and we could not trust the vehicle.  After our experience with the 2014 Jeep Cherokee, I will never purchase another Jeep.  They have lost my business for good.  Having problems with a 3-½ year old vehicle, which we were the only owners of and had driven lightly is unacceptable.  There are some things I liked about the 2014 Cherokee.  My wife and I really liked the interior of the vehicle.  It had a really nice design and quality materials.  We also liked the upgraded infotainment system – we had the 8.4-inch screen.  It was easy to use and had a sleek interface.  We liked that it had the capability to handle poor weather and modes to enhance the vehicle capability, such as snow mode.  We also liked how there were various storage compartments in the vehicle, more so than many other small SUV’s.  Maybe on the newer models Jeep has solved the 9-speed transmission problems.  But if you Google the 2014 and 2015 models, you will see a lot of complaints about harsh shifts.  For us, our Jeep was getting progressively worse.  Not only were there what I believe to be transmission issues, but also other problems which you should not experience with a newer vehicle. If you really want a Jeep, buy a regular Jeep such as a Wrangler.  Stay away from anything else they make.  I previously owner a Jeep Rubicon and had no issues with it.  If you are looking for an SUV, you should seriously consider other brands.  For anyone who owns a Jeep SUV, and in particular a 2014 Cherokee, I really hope you do not experience the problems we did."
"Engine Burns Oil, Chrysler says it is OK  My engine started burning oil at around 40,000 miles that I could notice. It burned so much in between oil changes that the engine SHUT DOWN in the middle of the road with NO WARNING. It had consumed all the oil to empty in about 6000 miles. I took it to the dealer who recommended to Chrysler that the engine be replaced. Chrysler responded that it did not approve the procedure because ""WE HAVE NO REASON TO CHANGE. NEEDS TO BE AT 1000 MILES PER QUART""  this quote is from the reports I received with my invoice. In conclusion, they did nothing because per Chrysler, THEIR ENGINES ARE OK IF THEY CONSUME UP TO 1 QUART OF OIL FOR EVERY 1000 MILES. This means I have to add up to 6 quarts of oil in between oil changes. Per the dealer recommendation, I should keep oil in my car and check the oil every time I add gas. Is this normal for a 3-year old, 50,000 mile car???  I would recommend to stay away unless you are willing to take the risk on the engine."
"Love my 2017 Stang GT!  My GT has the performance package.  It's really an amazing car when considering it's price.  For what I paid I got an IRS, big engine that I can put a supercharger on and crank it up to 800hp at the wheels (when the warranty runs out), excellent looks all around, and a car that has over 50 years of history/experience behind it!  Comparing it's specs to any other car in the same price range consistently showed it to be the far superior choice which is ultimately why I chose it.  Only complaint I have are the summer only Pirelli's Ford went with for the performance package.  Pure garbage!  They don't offer any superior performance even on hot dry pavement over Pilots and other popular replacements.  Plus they wear out VERY quickly!  But they are easy enough to replace."
"They Can't Fix Them  After 4 trips to the dealership to repair the transmission issue which is a common problem with this car, I gave up.  I now own a Honda CRV."
Can't drive a Cherokee at night  When one buys a car. It is test driven during the day. The headlights are so bad on the Cherokee  I keep the headlights on high beam all the time all the time and still cannot see more than 30'. On coming cars do not flash me to dim the headlights.
"Crap-o-kee  DO NOT BUY THIS SUV! I have made a lot of good financial decisions in my life...this was not one of them. I regretted the purchase the moment I took it home. In fact; I tried to return the car within the 48 hour return window. They talked me into keeping this lemon by taking another $1,000 off the price and re-worked the financing. So I reluctantly took this jalopy home again...that was two years ago. Since then...6 trips to the dealership service department. (I'm talking about the first two years of a brand NEW car)...not including oil changes. New transmission, recall, recall, bad injector ($460, not covered under powertrain warranty), another recall on brakes, bad coil - not covered....I cannot write anymore, I am getting to upset! This car is about to go...I am going to gladly take a $3,000 hit to get out of this heal on wheels. First and ONLY domestic car I will ever buy. STAY AWAY FROM JEEP!!!"
"I wanted to like it a lot more than I did  I turned in our 2014 Jeep Cherokee 4x4 Latitude V6 at the end of a 3-year lease. Except for the transmission that seemed to want to scare us on a regular basis, this was a solid vehicle. But unfortunately that was a HUGE if, as the unpredictability of the transmission from a stop made it solidly unsafe. Cons: unpredictable transmission that felt like it slipped into first gear. Multiple flashes and trips to the dealer yielded 'no problems'. Oddly, one trip for an oil change fixed the problem, until they did the next repair and it went back to slipping.  The 4-5 recalls didn't help, although all were covered at no cost to me. The tires wore out after only 18,000 miles. Wow. The cruise control worked fine on the flats, but in the hills it would wait until 4-5 mph down from the set speed before kicking in, and there was zero control going downhill. The transmission Sport setting turned off the DSC (stability control). Why? Did they think we're running the Jeep on a track? I used Sport in traffic and on hills to make the reluctant transmission more responsive. We also experienced a few nagging buzzes/rattles that the dealer couldn't find.  I couldn't help but hit the phone activate button the steering wheel at least once a trip while making a turn. Pros: Beautiful, well thought-out interior. Excellent controls (other than the phone button location). Plenty of room. We loved the hidden storage under the passenger seat. We never got stuck, even in nasty ice & snow. Blizzaks definitely helped. The cabin heat worked well and kept the windshield clear. The sound system was well-balanced. Plenty of power with the V6. I just wish they'd paired it with a standard 6-speed auto."
Defective Jeep  I've always loved Jeeps until I purchased this Jeep cherokee.  It has caused me nothing but issues.   I've had it in the shop multiple times for the same transmission issues and the service dept comes back saying we updated the software and it's working great now...give it a week and it's back to the same as before I brought it in.  Every recall that has been issued has happened to my Jeep.  I have 29000 miles on this vehicle and have broken down 5 times.  I tried to trade it in but the value of the car has gone down significantly due to the issues I'm having a terrible time getting rid of it.  Unfortunately this Jeep is terrible and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.  I'm at the point now that I have no other choice but contacting a lawyer.
"Quirky Jeep computerization on wheeels  The only bellyache I have with this car is the quirky reprogramming of the transmission through recalls and some other components where the service light wold be activated.  Aside from that the car is very good on gas, nice infotainment unit, fit and finish is pleasing.  The Jeep Cherokee V6 is a great value compared to the Asian counterparts that are becoming more and more overrated and overpriced."
"Solution for transmission and all negative reviews  There are a lot of unfair negative reviews for the Cherokee KL. Like any relationship, the solution is to listen… in this case to the vehicle messages and dealer service center. Yes, I too was frustrated at 7k miles when my transmission cut power on the freeway and I had to pull over, but I listened to the vehicle message prompts and was on my way to the dealer in ‘Limp Home Mode’. The industry’s first 9-speed transmission is incredible, but not perfect and it actually knows that by including a fail-safe of putting the Jeep in 4th gear while in DRIVE allowing speeds up to 40 mph. PARK, REVERSE, and NEUTRAL all still work according to the owner’s manual… yes, I actually read it and the service manager did not know all this which was annoying.It was also annoying that after a suspect ‘computer control update’, the transmission dropped 2 days later at the exact same location. I read up on the issue and had a sensible discussion with the service manager who agreed to install the improved 2015 design. FCA contacted me with a claim number and provided a rental car along with a voucher for 5 free oil services. My V6 Cherokee now has 34k miles on it with no issues, other than a noticeable shift from 2nd to 3rd which I understand is worse with the 4cyl, but nothing is defective. The Chrysler 200, Acura TLX/MDX, Land Rover Evoque/Discovery Sport share the same 9-speed and same complaints/good reviews. I did too much research and test drove many crossovers to find the Cherokee to be the best value bar none; 100k mile warranty, Smooth V6, over 270 HP, 4,500 lb. towing, 7 sec 0-60, over 30 mpg hwy, industry’s best 8.4” infotainment system, standard leather finishes, LED lighting, lots of hidden storage space which explains why reviews claim ‘less cargo space than competitors’ as in visible cargo... all for about $20k new. These features are better than base ‘premium’ crossovers which explains why the Cherokee is marketed in Europe as a Premium model.FCA did provide some oil changes years ago but did not put me up to writing this review. Good work making things right Jeep, I’d definitely buy another and recommend it to others as well."
"14 6 cylinder jeep latitude  We bought our 2014 Jeep Cherokee 4wd, 6 cylinder and currently have 55k on it. We love the ride, mileage and overall driveability. We traded in for a Jeep for 4wd commuter that was good for snow and winter. It has handled excellent. We did have a lot of issues initially thay the dealer couldnt figurd. It ended up being the driveshaft that was howling. Ive read quite a few people commenting and having the same issue, but apparently Jeep doesnt want to address that issue. The vehicle has more recalls than I've ever seen on any other vehicle, but for the last year or so, we have had pretty good luck.The 9 speed transmission is definitely a bit goofy and has issues for sure, but no major issue thatbhas put us in a bad spot- yet at least.We have had the vehicle for a year and a half and with the last year being much better for repairs and issues than the first few months, I would buy another. Updated"
Worst car ever  Bought new March 2014 for $26500. Owned for 2.5 years with so many problems. The vehicle stalled while driving with no engine lights on three times. Dealer fixed it but won't tell the cause. It is so underpowered and with worst driving experience. Dumped for $13500 with only 25k miles before warranty expire.
"Long Term Owner  This is our 5th Jeep. It had 2 recalls. Never has stranded or failed us in the 34,000 miles we have had it. The transmission at first was a little off, every time we had an oil change our dealer would check it and update. Each time it got better and works fine. We had a sunroof rattle at 21,000 miles. It was fixed under warranty same day. We have a FWD version with the 2.4 4 cyl. It gets great mileage as our metro area is dense and in traffic all of the time. We get 22 in the city in our traffic impressive, it has been on a few long road trips it averages 32. The Cherokee very comfortable has a nicer interior than most of its class. The leather quality is better than our BMW 328i!Update: We are now over 43,000 miles no other issues. Transmission is smooth, shifts perfectly, would buy another hands down.Update: now at 53,000 miles tires were replaced. Transmission has been updated. Still runs well and very happy with this vehicle."
Great bang for the buck  Turns heads.  Great car to scratch the muscle car itch for reasonable money.
"Total Regret 2014 Jeep Cherokee  My husband and I purchased a 2014 Jeep Cherokee in April of 2016.  It had about 34,000 miles on it.  We started having issues in July.  The vehicle would experience complete loss of power, and the transmission wouldn't downshift when you went downhill.  The dealership said this was happening due to low oil - even though my dashboard showed 30% oil life remaining.  Fast forward to October.  We drove the Jeep out of town for a wedding.  We were driving home on a Sunday, and attempted to merge onto the interstate.  My husband accelerated, and the Jeep suddenly stopped accelerating and warning lights came on the dashboard.  Luckily, we made it home.  I called the dealership on 10/24 and brought my Jeep out there.  On the drive to the dealership, I experience complete loss of power while in traffic.  I ended up having to use the 'Towing Assistance' feature (which works wells by the way).  It is now November 14th.  I've been in contact with Chrysler and the dealership.  The vehicle needs a new engine, plus they're taking care of the transmission recall.  Going to request a buyback at this point.  I don't trust the Jeep brand any longer."
Pretty nice!!!  Only thing I dont like is the poor acceleration. But I get 29-33mpg average
"2014 Jeep Latitude- LEMON  Look up transmission issues. My car died 5x while driving in traffic.  In some cases my car was going the speed limit and it shut off completely. Loss of power, no steering, brakes did not engage. My family finally told me not to get in the car. Insurance informed me they could no longer insure me if I drove this car (unsafe and I could injure someone). After battling for almost a year, I got rid of the car and bought a safe car. Jeep did less than nothing. The dealer also did less than nothing. They lied and even my tech said he would not drive the car and that Jeep needed to buy it back. Still nothing.  It's a LEMON.  I have a good lawyer and it's moving."
"Buyer Beware!!!!!  I've been leasing my 2014 Jeep Cherokee Latitude, and I'm deeply concerned about it keeping me, and my family safe.  I'm on recall #4 now, and this time, it's because it powers down without notice.  On Sept. 19, I was driving 30 mph and everything shut OFF---I had to coast to the side of the road--NOT good.  If you go to Safercar.gov, you'll find 838 Jeep Cherokee complaints---no, 839 complaints (including mine).  Save yourself a headache, and head to the IIHS.org website to look for a SAFE SUV...if I can prevent you from making a mistake like I did, then I've done my job.  Happy car shopping!"
"""No Show Customer Service"" by Jeep  Vehicle has lost power 3 times. Had towed to dealership due to Recall S55, Transaxle Wire Harness. This began 8/28/16 and the car is undrivable. It is now 9/16 an Jeep has no replacement parts available yet! Had to rent a car.Don't expect custome service from this manufacurer!"
"Never ever again!  We bought a 2014 Jeep Cherokee on June 14.  Okay....it was two years old and had 40,000 miles, so it was not brand new.  It ran rough since the first day,, shifting HARD in automatic mode.  On the eleventh day of owning the car, drove two hours away from home with the rough shifting.  Coming home, the transmission went out.  We were able to limp home using the manual mode.  The dealership where we bought sent it to our local Jeep garage.  It was there for ONE MONTH.  One entire month.  The transmission needed replaced.  Then something else was broken during the repair.  Then the new transmission supposedly came in already broken and needed to be taken out and sent back.  In the meantime, I traded it and went back to a Chevy Equinox.  Never ever again will I buy from Jeep.  And as a side note.....are garages supposed to report issues like this so that it shows up on the carfax for the next unsuspecting buyer?  Because there is nothing on the carfax for this vehicle showing that it sat in the Jeep garage for a month.  Wow.  Shifty.  (No pun intended.)."
"No confidence in Jeep  My Jeep Cherokee 2014 has already been recalled 5 times. On August the 17th the car stop abruptly in fast moving traffic when the transmission failed. A little internet research reveals that Jeep has had multiple transmission issues with their 9 speed transmission. I contacted the manufacturer and requested a 3 year extension on my vehicle as I have no confidence the car. So far they have refused. It is incomprehensible and outrageous that you can invest $ 30,000.00 dollars in a automobile that fails, puts your safety at risk and Jeep refuses to back up it product. My previous vehicle was a Chevy Colorado. It has over 140,000 mile on it and is 15 years old. I have have never had it in the shop for anything other than an oil change. It has a 10 year power train warranty. I never had to use it.My son is currently using it for college and still no mechanical concerns. I took a leap of faith and purchased a Jeep. It clearly was a mistake. The internet is riddled with Jeep owners transmission issues. I will never purchase another Jeep product and advise all buyers to beware. The only good note the people at Tate in Glen Burnie have been courteous and helpful in helping me repair my faulty vehicle. When you make a $30,000.00 dollar purchase you should have confidence in your vehicle. I currently have a Jeep case manager reviewing my issue. Will see where this goes.2/21/2017: Initially received little help , follow up or assistance from Corporate customer service Jeep case manager. I filed a complaint with the Maryland Attorney Generals office. They assigned me a mediator who contacted Chrysler/Fiat. After having my concerns ignored the Maryland Attorney General Office got their attention. The Maryland Attorney General's Office was wonderful. Government does work for it's constituents.  A Chrysler representative called me at home and asked- how they could resolve my complaint. I requested a 100,000 mile extended bumper to bumper warranty as I was no longer confident in the vehicle. They agreed. The transmission after several repairs has been operating with out issue although the shifter now needs replacement which the dealer service department has ordered. The dealership service people have been wonderful and I have nothing but good things to report on their efforts to resolve customer concerns satisfactorily.  I think Chrysler has resolved some of the major transmission issues that plagued the 2014 Jeep Cherokee. I am still somewhat disgruntled that $30,000.00 dollar vehicle should have resulted in 7 recalls and suffered a major transmission failure. If when I purchased the Jeep the sales representative had suggest that I could expect multiple recalls and perhaps transmission issues would anyone have purchased this vehicle? Of course not. To be fair I have to say I really like the Jeep it had what I was looking for in a small SUV. But Jeep customers should not have to endure this level of inconvenience and difficulty for choosing to buy Chrysler."
"MY JEEP IS TURNING OFF---WHILE DRIVING  I have a 2014 JEEP LATITUDE. My engine is burning my oil and it shuts off my jeep- WHILE DRIVING! I've now had it looked at by the dealership 4 times and even ended up in a minor car accident because of it and still Chrysler insists they have to continue running oil life tests on my vehicle.  I've even had to go to a local Auto Zone and purchase 5QTS of oil just to get my vehicle to turn back on and get it back to the dealership. The whole situation is very frustrating and Chrysler is doing nothing about it, saying they have official bulletins stating that it's normal for Jeeps to be burning oil. Trust me if I knew I would be struggling with my new Jeep more than I was with my old car I wouldn't have even considered JEEP. Dealership only suggestion was for me to monitor the oil daily!--Who buys a new car and has to check the oil DAILY just to make it down the street"
"Do Not Buy This Piece of Garbage  Fiat Chrysler of America must be paying people to write positive reviews here.  That is the only possible explanation for this POS  receiving glowing reviews from a few individuals here.  Be careful when you see superlatives that are out of place or language such as ""you must buy this item"".  This is by far the worst SUV I have ever owned.  Mine is the 6cyl 4x4. It has been back to the dealer for three seperate recalls and we have experienced the same transmission problems that others have noted here.  Why, just last night the battery went dead for some unknown reason (this is a two year old vehicle) and when my wife attempted to start it, there were all sorts of warning symbols displayed (Check Engine, Parking Brake, Transmission, Traction Control).  The vehicle had applied the parking brake on its own and could not be shifted out of park.  I bought a new battery and started the car.  Initially, it would not shift out of park.  When I was finally able to shift it into reverse, it slammed into gear and I was able to back down the driveway.  Once in the street, it would not shift into drive, only neutral.  Guess what, you can't shut this thing off in neutral....only in Park.  So there I sat, with the car running, in Neutral, in the middle of the street.  Finally, the car suddenly let me shift into Drive and I made my way to the dealer in 3rd or 4th gear.  At the dealership, the service writer attempted to move the car and it got stuck in Neutral again.  They had to pull a fuse to shut it off and push it into a service bay.  We'll see how long it takes for them to figure this one out.  This car has problems with the electronics and the electrical system in general.  What may seem like a transmission issue may actually be the electronics.   We bought this to flat tow behind a motorhome.  Guess what?  Fiat just came out with a TSB warning that modifications may have to be made to the steering wiring harness to make it towable.  Even then, the electronics seem to have a life of there own.  I would consider this car unsafe for flat towing.  I owned a Wrangler prior to this and had -0- issues with flat towing.  AVOID THIS VEHICLE AT ALL COSTS!"
"Fantastic Jeep!  I lease this car and it is a great Jeep. I love the way it rides and handles. All of which are very smooth. The MPG is a little cruddy but thats expected when you are driving a Jeep. The pick up however is really good, I used to drive a Trailblazer and this car with the 9-speed transmission can go! We have had this car for two years and we love it. We pull a 23' trailer with this small SUV, we have the 6 cylinder engine. The interior is perfectly laid out and the seats are so comfortable. I am 6'6"" and There is room in this car for a person who is 7' which is really hard to fine. The 2014 model had some transmission kinks that have been worked out in the newer models that I have test driven. I strongly suggest you buy this car and put it in your driveway!"
"MY AMAZING LITTLE PONY - GO PONY GO!  I am in love with my new little ruby red pony car that drives like a stallion!  This is the fourth Mustang I have owned.  I purchased all of them brand new. I loved each and every one of them, and then the 2017 arrived!  I saw it featured on the internet, and I kept saying that is my new car, and it is now.  The ruby red is a metallic color, and it really shines in the sun; it is gorgeous!  I own the 6 cylinder automatic. I am extremely impressed. I almost went for the GT, but the V6 was more affordable.  I was shocked when I drove it.  It is about five times faster than the other Mustangs I have owned - the last one being a 2004.  The 2004 and the two models I purchased in the 90's all seemed sluggish.  Not my new V6; that little pony flies down the road.  I haven't driven a car that flew in a very long time.  You step on the gas, and you're off and running.  This car's acceleration is fantastic; it really moves.  When I'm at a red light, the cars that were next to me are about two or more car lengths away.  The freeway is unbelievable.  I took my new pony out for the maiden voyage about 1:00 AM as I live in Southern California where the traffic is horrible.  I wanted to take my new car out for a spin.  I couldn't believe how fast that car can go with little to no effort.  I had the car up to 105 mph but didn't even know it until I looked at the speedometer.  It felt like I was going about 70.  It handles incredibly.  This car just hugs the road and is fantastic when making a fast turn.  Okay, so I drive like a nut, but this car has airbags all over the place, a long hood, so it should hold up extremely well in the event something should happen.  The safety reviews were five stars. All of my former Mustangs were totaled, one of which went upside down.  As the human Mustang test dummy, the Mustangs hold up extremely well in accidents.  Since this Mustang has a lot more safety features than my old ones, I'm sure it is extremely sound, The exterior is just gorgeous, and I especially like the hood. Overall the car seems longer and wider than my other Mustangs.  The keyless entry is great.  You don't even have to take the keyless remote out of your handbag (or pocket) to open the car. You simply grab the handle, and the car magically opens.  To lock it, you close the door and place a finger on the end of the handle, and the car locks.  I'm 57 and can get in and out of the car very easily.   Now for the interior.  I bought it with the basic package, but the basic package has all the amenities I want and/or need.  I lied except for one thing, neither of the front seats are power.  The other Mustangs had a power driver's seat.  Then again, I was playing with the all the front seat adjustments.  If you like your seat in one place which most people do, the no power seats is not a problem.  Actually it seems the seats are very adjustable.  As far I can tell the seat goes forward and all the way back to the back seats!  Therefore, if you happen to be tall, I can't see there being a problem with the car being too small.  The seats also go up and down, and the back of the seat is also adjustable.  The basic package come with cloth seats. Doesn't everyone want leather; well, I got the basic package.  My car came with the ruby red exterior with what they call ebony seats.  The seats are dark, but they are not jet black.  I'm going to say it's a very pretty shade of a dark gray. I love it, and the seats are very comfortable as well.  It has Bluetooth which to me is a luxury from my 2004.  It is so cool!  It plays the songs off my iPhone.  Today I tried calling a friend, and I could them extremely well, and the controls are on the steering wheel in an accessible place.  My car also will read your speed from 0 to 60 etc.  That is a must for me to try out when I'm not in a busy traffic area.  In the manual I believe it has paddle controls on the steering wheel in the event you want to drive it like a manual transmission - I don't so won't be using that perk.  I almost forgot about the tilt steering wheel. I tried it out last evening.  I was so impressed.  That wheel not only tilted but you can also adjust the distance of the wheel.  I moved the steering wheel closer to me and lowered it a bit.  Now it really feels like I'm driving a race car.  I'm extremely glad I didn't get the V8 as the V6 has all the power I will ever need.  I highly recommend this car. I've only owned mine for two weeks, but it is so much fun to drive.  I really love it and anyone who buys this car surely will too!"
"Best Vehicle I've ever owned  Wow after reading all the bad reviews of this vehicle I guess the stars and planets all lined up when ours was built. Our V6 Trailhawk is a early build model Dec 2013. The only issues we've had was a water pump that squealed and a sunroof rattle. Both were fixed under warranty. I've had all the transmission updates done. It shifts very smooth. Yes there are few recalls which is not surprising being that's it's a new model first year build. Other than that it's been very reliable. I have over 40k miles, taken it off road several times. I participated in two Jeep Jamborees. I pushed it really hard. It came through totally unscathed. I'm really impressed with the versatility of this vehicle. It can tow 4500 lbs,  great comfort, latest technology, and excellent off road capability. It's possible that many of the negative reviews on here are a vocal crowd that have had bad luck with their vehicles. Hopefully most other owners have had better luck and do not participate in writing reviews. Of course if I had all the issues that others had on here I would be just as vocal and extremely unhappy with my vehicle. I just hope ours is not a fluke."
"Love My Jeep!  Currently at 14k miles no major issues. Transmission takes awhile to break in and can still be a bit jerry but nothing big, the software updates helped. I only have the 4x4 with active drive I but this little jeep tames the trails like nothing! Took it up a terrible 5 mile dirt trail to a cabin through mud, snow and ice and was scared wouldn't make it up the mountain but it sure did! No loss of traction or control and plenty of clearance. I was amazed. Putting into manual definitely helps and is a great feature along with snow mode. No chains needed and I just have the stock all season Le 2 tires. City driving is good but sometimes sluggish on acceleration  with the little 4 cylinder but hugs the road and fun to drive. Big enough for me, the 3 kids and the dogs. Comfortable and stylish. Love it and am definitely a loyal jeep patron!"
"Consider putting one of these in your driveway  Purchased a low mileage 6 cylinder Trailhawk with all the bells and whistles. We are extremely happy with this vehicle. Ride,fit, finish with attention to detail are impressive. Very comfortable all around. Storage behind the seats is a bit cramped. We have owned (currently) several mid level Mercedes products as well as Infiniti, Acura, BMW, Range Rover, (and Jeep). Not as luxurious as an Range Rover but detail finish is pretty close, impressive ride and quiet with off-road ability, and less operating cost. Interior seems more durable than BMW.  Front is a bit odd style wise no more so than Lexus or Audi gaping mouth style but outstanding cars just the same. We have had zero transmission problems but this had been addressed by the previous owner. I would have been upset if I had just purchased new and had to get to the dealer several times to correct problems. Tires are starting to get noisy at 48k miles but still look like they will last for another 25. No significant interior wear, no significant squeaks or rattles. Most of our MB  and Infiniti service experiences were positive not as much for jeep. Most  of the  Japanese brands we had problems were unsolveable transmission related and ALL should have had recalls but the press seems to ignore customer complaints. At least The JEEP brand addresses and corrects problems in an open manner. They should build an SRT model. already have driven 30k + miles with zero issues and has been our primary vehicle."
"DANGER DANGER!!  Loved my new 2014 Lattitude when I first got it.  Everything worked very well, main problem at that time is that the headlights were not automatic so I had to get used to remembering to put them on at night in a lighted area. Then it all started to go south!  First the Bluetooth stopped working, couldnt get sound, voice mail, texts or anything from my cell phone to the car - it worked at first. Never got that corrected after many tries and calls.  Then transmission started to act up, at same location every day when I had to accelerate out of my development ( on to a 60mpd road) it would shift and slow down while I was trying to accelerate to avoid an accident. This was attempted to be corrected several times at the dealership but it always came back shortly thereafter. Then last Sunday, again in the same location, instead of slowing down, the transmission just quit!  The dash looked like a christmas tree with all the flashing lights and sounds.  I could not accelerate or anything, just luckily was able to roll to the next street and pull over. Normally this road is loaded with cars going 60-70 mph but it was late and it was not the case. It said to put in park and then shift to drive but every time I did it it would make a very loud clunking sound and light up SERVICE TRANSMISSION. I ended up just shutting it off for a few mins and was then able to make it back home with the engine light on. It was towed the next morning and the only thing that the dealer was able to do was reprogram the damn computer again!  How many times does this need to go on before someone gets hurt or killed?  Fiat Chrysler Jeep should be ashamed for putting people in harms way.  Get these vehicles off the road!  I am putting in a case at Customer Care but I am not hopeful. I got the POS as a lease and have 16 mos to go. God help me if I can't get out of this thing!  I am afraid to drive it now and I have a 10 year old daughter to drive around as well.  It hurts my stomach every time I have to pay my monthly payment on this thing. Don't even consider this vehicle!  Not worth the safety risk and aggravation."
"Just walk away  I was so excited when we first purchased this Jeep! Bought it brand new! Hadn't even had it two years and we finally washed our hands of it last night, thank goodness! The transmission is so temperamental, the dealership made us feel crazy when we would complain how it drove. The acceleration was not very responsive and one month after having it we had to have a defensive tore replaced because it would shimmy the entire vehicle when driving high speeds. Comforting let me tell you. Oh! Let me tell you about comforting. My husband and I are on the highway going 75 and the car completely turns off. OFF! I had my daughter in the backseat so that freaked me out even more. It turned itself back on and all these alerts kept dinging and then saying our 4WD no longer was working. We head to the exit ramp and the car shuts off once again bringing us to a complete stop. When my husband finally got the car to start back up he had to floor it so we could get home at 11mph. Once we arrived home, as soon as my husband let off the gas, the rpms shot up and made a terrible sound. He tried to turn it off by pushing the button and it wouldn't turn off. It was ridiculous. Needless to say this was the worst vehicle I've ever purchased. It's a shame it drove so terribly because the inside was pretty comfortable. save your money. Please."
"6 recalls engine light on twice  Great 4 wheeler, but that's where it ends..push on the gas wait 5 second to go.very confused 9 speed transmission. Change lanes jeep pulls that way.14 mag in the city. Battery dead after 15 months. $200 DOLLARS!! FOR NEW ONE. Bugs not worked out of this one!!!"
Take the Leap !  Buy a Jeep  
"Jeep cherokee 2014  I waited so long for this jeep Cherokee and finally bought it and ordered the top line of the trail hawk 4x4 . At first everything was fine and after 3872 miles i started feeling weird transmission shifting. took it to the jeep dealership and the mechanic told me that i have to get used to it. it stated getting worse after a week , i ended up taking in again and again and again and again and again.... 7 times and finally the transmission failed on them and they put a new transmission for me. It was same problem again, so this jeep Cherokee looks good on the outside but mechanically SUCKS. So I hired a lawyer and here we are lemon law case and they end uo buying it back from me . I m waiting for my check. For all of u people , don't ever buy extended warranty on any car, when they buy it back u lose most of your warranty, add the extended warranty after 2nd year of purchasing and if u like the car ONLY."
Never Buy this vehicle  Very thankful for good consumer biased Lemon Law. This vehicle went back to Jeep for Lemon Law. Total ownership was just over 1 year. It was mostly in the shop for 5 months. Another month or two for Lemon Law to flow through.  We had a 6 cylinder Trailhawk. Options for Edmunds were not available. It took multiple times in the shop to figure out the driver rear knuckle was machined wrong from the factory. The dash was removed a few times before the entire HVAC was replaced. The defective HVAC would cause a vibration/droning intermittently. The final straw was an intermittent cooling system leak. Dealer acknowledged there was a problem. They were unable replicate at the dealer. It would leak at odd times. The transmission was never correct. The Jeep 9spd was almost like driving a Nissan CVT. Rear cargo storage was less than expected. The wheels for the moonroof cover would constantly rattle while on the road. Infotainment system worked great. Satellite radio would cutout in the city. Front seats were comfortable. Navigation worked ok. Not as good as Google Maps on a smartphone.
"Never again!  We bought a low serial number 2014 Jeep Cherokee with the V6 and Active Drive II 4WD. The Jeep looked nice and handled really well on the test drive. It came semi-stripped with manual seats, no nav, and no backup camera, but had the low range 4WD and heated seats, mirrors, and ,my wife's favorte part, a heated steering wheel. Having had a 1996 Grand Cherokee for over 300,000 miles we decided to give this one a try. Well Jeep has made a wrong turn with this one. Instead of the reliable simple 1996 ZJ, this XK Jeep is horrible. The overly complicated 9 speed transmission has been in the shop six times now for updates and repairs. The infotainment system can be hacked and used to take over the throttle, steering, and brakes. I mean come on, who connects the radio to the steering? The 4WD system is not up to par either.  I took it on the lawn to drop off a smal tree I had bought and it got stuck! on level grass! The factory tires came off the next day and better ones were fitted, but it will still spin the tires in the wet and that is with the traction controls on!. The transmission shifts like a 16 year old learning to drive stick, the gas mileage is averaging 21 and not hte 30 they claimed. SInce my 1996 ZJ got an average of 19, I do not see what benefit the new 9 speed is giving. In fact it does not shift into 8 until you hit 70 and I have never gotten it into 9 which is only from 100 and up - Believe me nobody wants to drive this at 100mph.The visibliity is horrible out the back due to the styling and you cannot see the front of the car either. This makes this Jeep not really off-roadable. If you buy one you will need the backup camera or get used to backing up using your mirrors.On the plus side, the seats fold easily and the space once they are down is pretty large. the controls are pretty well placed and easy to use and since it has a push-pull shifter you can go through the gears yourself, which is smoother than letting the transmission shift for itself. It looks nice and the oil filter is on top of the engine making it real easy to replace it, which you will be doing alot since even with synthetic oil it seems to get dirty around 3000 miles. The power from the 3.2 six is nice at 272HP. I was told by somebody about somethign else, but it applies here. It looks great, is horrible to operate and breaks down often. What do you expect, it is Italian. Basing this Jeep off of an Alfa SUV was a mistake. I wonder if the new Renegade, which is based off of a FIAT is just as bad... To make matters worse, all thoughout this Jeep are things like a silhouette of a WWII Jeep MB on the windshield, the words Jeep, since 1941 on the steering wheel, and the Jeep grille/headlights logo stamped on random things under the hood, which is funny since the grill of the XK looks nothing like that of a MB/CJI am going to be looking for a 2003-2004 Grand Cherokee Overland - a REAL JEEP to replace this."
"2006 V6 Coupe Premium + Options  I have owned 3 mustangs recently; a 2002 V6, a 2004 anniversary V6, and my current 2006 V6 coupe.  The 2006 is by far the best of the three I've owned. The sleek exterior reminiscent of the fastback look and retro interior are much preferred to the builds in the first half of the 2000's. My model is a torch red 5 speed manual which shifts much smoother than the previous vehicles. Options include all the V6 premium additions plus Pony Package (fog lamps / upgraded grill are sporty). The interior has a limited dark charcoal all leather finish, and the dash is upgraded to include the multi-function display below the speedometer and SHAKER-1000 Audio - much improved over previous MACH systems"
"2017 DON,T BUY  Only have 1300 miles on the car and the car started to have 2 major problems. The first is when you reach speeds of 50mph or greater the car vibrates and gets worse the faster you drive. The second is the shifting makes metal pinging noise. I have been at the dealer twice so far and they still have not fixed either problem. I am bringing the car back to the dealers again and I do not have much confidence that they will get it fixed. I have looked into these 2 problems and it seems that a lot of Mustang owners have the same problems without having their car fixed. I hope Edmunds reads this and looks into these problems. If anyone reading this and has these problems, please let Edmunds know and maybe they can help us out."
"Expensive oil changes with recommended additive!  Be prepared for weird things to happen with the electronics on their own- parking brake engages without any input from the driver, messages appear after braking hard and now windshield wipers may malfunction.I would rather be driving my old 2009 Honda CRV. Brakes and disc needed to be replaced @ 43000 miles$100?"
"Learn the Lemon Law in your state  LOVED this truck on the lot and for the first 15K miles...then literally downhill from there.  With 4 visits to the dealership for transmission software upgrades and 2 tranny replacements later, I am now waiting on an arbitration decision for replacement or reimbursement.  Very disappointed as I loved taking this truck off road.  It handled mud, hills and dirt trails with no issue.  Highway driving, however has been far more thrilling than it should be with ""wobbling"" between gears in downshifts and acceleration from standing position.  Lurching forward in traffic is not fun. Slowing down 50-60mph and feeling like an anchor was dropped changes your plans for stopping distance. Hoping to replace this with  new SUV that works."
"Electronics are terrible  Have 33k on 2014 Cherokee and many problems with the electronics.  Been in shop several times because hatch won't open, USB won't read, or because it shows songs on flash drive up to nine times.  Dealer usually resets system which solves it for a while.  Several times electronics blacked on for a while and hatch wouldn't open or close with switch (worked with remote).  Dealer never found problem....just reset system.  Front strut mount made rubbing noise in cold weather.   Dealer replaced it after months of waiting for part.  Now radio shows many songs, hatch don't open manually, and vehicle won't start!   This is without a doubt my LAST Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep product!   Wish I had never bought this one!"
"Great idea - poor transmission / reliability  Pros: comfortable, nice infotainment system, trailrated 4WD, 3.2L performance, sunroofCons: reliability, transmission, driveability, gas mileage, headlightsI really wanted to love this car and I do for the most part.The transmission is the weak link - sometimes it seems to work just fine, other times uneven performance. Hard to maintain a constant speed on the highway or up hills. Often no throttle response at all, depending on how it feels.Been in the shop multiple times for transmission updates.No air cond at all when new - took a week in the shop to fix it (low Freon)Last week left me stranded with a frozen electronic parking brake. Water penetration (rain?) under the spare tire shorted out the parking brake module due to no sealant on a body seam."
Trans recall  I had my cherokee in for trans recall it shifts fine I get 30-33 gpg it goes into 9th gear at about 1900 rpm and about 70 mph the trans has overdrive in 6-7-8-9 so it will run in 6-7 most of the time 8th on interstate our speed limit is 65 on most
"Big disappointment  Bought the 2014 jeep latitude for my daughter , thinking it would be a safe car... Boy was I wrong! It has been serviced 3 times already for transmission issues... It won't accelerate.. Shifting very hard.. Can't find the right gear half the time... It rides great on highway if you can get on highway without getting killed .. If that's not bad enough we now get a gas smell throughout the car after filling the tank... And they say they can't find anything wrong... DO Not buy this car..."
car unsafe  I was so excited when I bought my 6cylinder 2014 Cherokee new. It had alot of features for a great price and we already had a grand Cherokee we were very happy with. It turned out to be the worst car I have ever driven. The transmission wasn't a problem during initial test drive but started to act up soon after the purchase. I found myself taking different roads to work because I feared it wouldn't pull out when I needed it to.  Also had a bad vibration or wobble in front end. After numerous visits to dealership they said hopefully a service engine light would come on and maybe then they could help me.  About 3 weeks later the transmission failed completely while driving! Thank god I wasn't on a highway or I could have been killed. Tow truck driver had trouble even getting it on truck because it wouldn't go into neutral.That was it for me. Chrysler finally approved new transmission control module but too little too late for me.  I looked into lemon law but was told it could take months to go thru the process and I needed a car to drive. Had part replaced and drove to a non jeep dealership the next day and got rid of it...and lost $10000 from what they would give me for trade verses what I had paid for it only 1 year earlier. My husband and I felt our family's safety was obviously most important.Stay away from this vehicle. Chrysler needs to do something because it is unsafe to be on the road.
"A very sad update to ""16 Months of Fun and Comfort  I could not see a way to update or edit a previous review.It is with a very sad heart that I must update my previous posting, ""16 Months of Fun and Comfort""If you read my previous review you'll see that we LOVED this car. But within weeks of posting that and with many miles already on the car, we began experiencing the same frustrating and dangerous transmission issues as everyone else. We just worked a deal to trade the car back in to the dealership on a used Grand Cherokee. We should NOT have had to do this!We were at the point of having the trans replaced, but after reaching out to a number of people who also got new transmissions installed, nobody felt it was a long term fix. Since our own experience did not begin until nearly 40k miles, there was just no way to have confidence in this car anymore. I cannot recommend strongly enough to avoid this car until ZF comes up with a working transmission. With all the lawsuits piling up now, and after paying a record $105M fine for poor response to such issues, I expect they will drop this model after the next year's production run. Such a shame!!!"
"EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS  This is the best vehicle I have ever purchased!  It performs like a sedan in terms of quiet ride, smooth ride, easy to park and move; yet has fold-down flat cargo capacity that is huge!!!!!  I can haul so much and yet, when I need to travel on a trip, I have enough cargo room for suit cases.  I highly recommend this awesome vehicle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  From Wisconsin and I do not have a 4 wheel drive version, I have a front wheel drive version and it's great in the snow too!"
"Dogs can open the windows while driving!  It seems when I go to accelerate, my Jeep Cherokee Latitude hesitates.  This can be frightening when you are expecting the vehicle to go and it doesn't.  My other suggestions would be to change the front window opening mechanism because if my dogs are in the front seat and the air is on, they can step on the window button and open them.  If I lock the windows, then I can't open them for the dogs to stick their heads out when I want them to be able to do that.  When the window is partly down, there is no way to keep them from opening them all the way.  I had a Jeep Liberty and those window controls were dog proof and much better.  The other suggestion is to move the voice controls from the steering wheel location.  My husband continually hits that button on accident and has to say cancel.  The best feature is the remote start, heated seats and steering wheel, but you can get that on other vehicles."
"Replacement for totaled 2012 Mustang  I bought this car as replacement for my 2012 mustang that was totaled in a three car highway accident.  A drunk driver going 120 mph rear ended an SUV, SUV bounced off the railing, crossed two lanes and struck my mustang on the drivers side.  My car went sideways 300 feet down the highway and off an embankment.  The car was totaled but I walked away with bruising, whiplash and working up back issues.  I had no hesitation in buying another mustang as I know it lives up to the safety ratings as well as its roll rating (my car did not which shocked the state police and fire crew).  I bought a stripped down coupe as I did not want all the electronics.  I live in area that gets snow.  I had no real issue with the rear wheel once I figured out where to put the weight.  I bought a manual and I am loving it.  I feel it has more acceleration then 2012 V6 mustang.  The interior is a bit smaller, seems designed for two people and a child in the back seat.  I spent two weeks looking at other cars and brands and I came back to this car due to the deal I got, know reliability and I can trust it will keep me safe."
"DO NOT BUY THIS CAR  Note: 3.2 V6After my initial sparkling review of this car, a new transmission had to be put in at 44k miles. Need I say more? Traded it in at 46k for a 2013 BMW 535xi because quite frankly my confidence in it was shot. Lost about $4000. Thanks FCA!!!! 🙄"
"Yeah...But No  Was so excited to get my new Jeep Cherokee. One month in, the car started shuddering heavily and pulling as I was driving down the road. The dashboard looked like a NASA lunar launch mission it was so lit up. Then the damn thing just...stopped. In traffic. Had it towed to the dealer. They couldn't find anything. Same thing happens again a couple of weeks later. Same result. A month later, I get locked inside the car. Yes--inside. Can't open the doors, the windows, nothing. Tow comes (3 hours, thank you Jeep Roadside Assistance), and again ""nothing."" Then the car started vibrating and shaking. Now the diagnosis was ""transmission problems."" Each time, the service took longer and longer, and it never got fixed. Each time = 5 times. And through all of this, I had to deal with the abysmal service through Chrysler Customer Care and their dealers, who are surly and condescending. Imagine calling for a service problem with a safety issue and being told that they have an appointment 9 days away. Yup--that happened. At first, I thought this was an isolated instance: my car was just a bad car. But after I did a little investigation, I discovered that these issues were known Jeep issues, especially the shaking and the transmission problems. Do yourself a favor and stay away.2016 Update: unloaded this POS in July. It had 4 recalls in one year. Couldn't be happier with my new Lexus. 'Nuff said."
"DO NOT BUY THIS RAGGEDY CAR  Update: 7/20/2014After my original post, the transmission started acting up again. I ended up suing Daimler Chrysler. Hired a Lemon Law Attorney who got me out of this Jeep. They bought it back under TX Lemon Law regulations. Car was paid off and I returned it to the dealership and went to Ford and bought an Explorer. They also covered my attorneys fees. Back experience that ended well. Original post:I bought this car just over a year ago. When on the test drive I noticed it was shifting hard. The salesperson told me, ""oh that's NORMAL"". I shrugged it off because after speaking with her I went and talked to the service technician who told me the hard shifting was normal for this particular vehicle and it would cease once it adjusted to the way I drove the car. I'm not mechanically inclined at all when it comes to cars but that response sounded absurd. But, I got a SUPER GREAT DEAL and bought it anyway. After having it for a few months, I took it in because the hard shifting had gotten worse. (Love Field Jeep Chrysler Dodge) They told me it was something minor and the issue was fixed. After about a month, I started to feel the hard shifting issue again and I before I could take it in, I received a recall notice in the mail. I took it in again and they ""reset this"" and ""adjusted that"" and they told me it would be fine. And, for about a week, it was. I took it in for the 3rd time and the service advisor called me after a couple of days and said, ""we have to replace your transmission"". They kept the car for a couple of weeks and when I got it back, the problem was finally fixed. BUT....about a month later, the car started dying while I was driving it. It would die, hesitate to start, start, die again, and finally it would stay running. After about 2 weeks of this I finally took it back to the shop to have it looked at. They kept it for a couple of days and then called me to say that they're having to REPLACE THE ENGINE!!!! Something about leaking valves engine compression...yadda, yadda, yadda!!!! The only good thing about this experience is that the service technician is a cutie!!! Other than that, DO NOT BUY THIS RAGGEDY CAR!!!!!"
"Jeep is a joke  I purchased my 2014 Jeep Cherokee on 04/2014. As soon as I drove it off the lot, the stereo module wouldn't connect to my bluetooth. 2 times in the shop, computer module was replaced. Few months later, the vehicle started ""changing gears"" while going 70 mph. It literally felt like the vehicle would change to neutral and the tires lock up. It only lasted a few seconds. Took it to the local Jeep dealership they said it was nothing wrong with it. Took it back with the same issue, still nothing wrong with it. Took it to the place I bought it, they fixed the transmission valve (after being in the shop for 3 weeks) I'be been having the vehicle back one month and it still has problems. "
"Warning!  Stay away!  Be aware that car manufacturers pay some reviewers to raise the overall rating of vehicles.  I had transmission problems from day one, a new transmission that still had problems at 16k miles after two software updates, engine lights requiring replacement of an air shuttle.  All in all, the first 24k miles, a year of owning the vehicle, I was without it for over two weeks.  What you're looking for in a new vehicle?  Me neither.  The transmission defects on this vehicle are well documented and in other reviews as well as mine.  Believe them.  There are many more reliable vehicles than this one, I'll never buy another Jeep product it's the worst vehicle I've ever owned."
"loved this car until a tree impaled and totaled it  This is the nicest car I've ever owned. Very reliable, comfortable, stable on roads - back roads, dirt roads, and highway. Got me through a lot of snow this past winter - even the husband was impressed with how well it handled in snow and was disappointed he couldn't play and make it slide. It looks good and can go from class to sass in no time. I now have almost 18,000 miles on it in 16 months and am very happy. No car is perfect but this beats all my previous and there have been many.   **Update - I know have almost 40,000 miles on my Cherokee and no issues, still loving this car! Last year hubby got a remote start installed for Christmas, best way to make this car even better. I can't ask for more. :) *** as of 8/1/2017 i no longer have this car, a tree at work fell on it and impaled it through the dash completely totaling it. i cried. this was my favorite car ever. if you can get one, do it, you won't be sorry!"
"Terrible Transmission!  Bought new, 6K miles (right now) and I'm on my 3rd transmission!!  I was told by Jeep Engineers that they don't know what is wrong with my Jeep so they just keep putting new transmissions in to see if it will be fixed.  I don't want this car anymore and I'm tired of it being in the shop more than having it in my driveway.  I used to love this car but now I hate it and will never buy another Jeep again.  2 months after this review I finally got Jeep to buy back this Jeep. A 4th transmission was put in and they wanted to do a 5th one."
"DONT! Just DONT!!!!!!!  First off the transmission went out at 2000 miles leaving me stranded unable to get it even to go into a gear since then it has been NOTHING but hard shiting, after taking it in the 3rd time I gave up bc Chrysler says its fixed, not even close. For 4 months straight the wheel bearings made a horrible sound then turning, after 4 times in the shop it turns out it needed new shocks/struts.  More recently the heating, my car has a mind of its own...it either blows hot or cold, there is NO in between.   This is the most expensive piece of crap ever made....GARBAGE! 15000 miles and has been in the shop 14 times, YES 14 times! what a joke, I cant wait to place a big bow on it when I win my lawsuit!"
"Constant Transmission Issues  Owned the car a year and has been to the stealership 5 times for shifting problems. Do not buy this car until Chrysler has fixed the shifting problems. My car will not down shift properly and wants to stay in 3rd gear. If you slow down and try to speed up, you cannot because you are in too high of a gear and have to stomp on the gas for it to go. I have been in almost 3 accidents because of this."
"16 Months of Fun and Comfort and then DISASTER  With nearly 40,000 miles on the clock and a wide range of road experiences behind us now, we LOVE this car!Our jeep turns heads with its great looks and fits into any parking lot next to Mercedes or Lexus models. However, the knowing looks of other owners betrays that they are aware our Jeep is much more capable.  The all wheel drive system seems seamless as we negotiate icy, twisty roads, deep sand or even deep snow. We continue to rack up carefree miles and truly enjoy our ownership experience. The few times we have needed Jeep support it has been there in first class style.We look forward to many more years of this love affair exploring the country. Well, that was then.UPDATE:We have since had the unhappy experience of tens of thousands of other owners who have had the complete transmission fail leave them stranded in dangerous spots. This happened to us a total of 5 times! We knew we were in real trouble when the Arbitrator was in the dealership trying to resolve the dispute with other owners on our last 2 visits to the service department. And I must say we felt lucky in our dealership experience; at least they were open and honest about the issue and as helpful as they could be. I have read and heard numerous reports of others being nearly completely abandoned by their dealer, who just took a hard line ""tough s*%t"" attitude with them. But, Jeep controls the repair process and it is long, tedious and will repeatedly put you in harms way. The last time we got stuck with a dead transmission was in the middle of a busy highway. Very Very scary situation. The transmission fail issue on this car HAS NOT BEEN FIXED. Many many people have opted for full trans replacement, but I have not heard a single one have confidence that this was truly a long term fix. More like they are just waiting for the new trans to start having the same fail. Face it, you buy a Jeep brand product in the expectation of at least occasionally taking it to a remote location. Otherwise you would settle for a different brand. With the prospect of complete transmission failure this becomes a serious risk if you are 50 or 100 miles from nearest help. Not acceptable. We wound up having to trade this in on a lightly used Grand Cherokee Overland. This was not an ideal solution by any means, but got us out of this dangerous vehicle in the best way we could."
Awesome  Bargain on price.
"WORST CAR EVER  Please, everyone do yourself a favor DO NOT  buy this car. THIS CAR IS DANGEROUS. I have brought my truck to the service center 7 times since I purchased it. My truck is now in the service center indefinitely because it is deemed unsafe to drive by the dealership. I have never been so disappointed in a purchase in my entire life. I wasted thousands of dollars on this truck and have had non of my issues resolved. I was driving it tuesday and as I turned onto a major highway the car completely stalled and stopped accelerating (automatic transmission). I have a fractured vertebrae and 2 bulging disks. If I got into an accident because the car does not work I could have gotten killed!"
had a great drive  The new Jeep Cherokee is something I'll recommend to all SUV enthusiasts. I bought it a ear ago from Repokar car auction for a good price and had a great experience driving it. Now I am selling it because I've owned another model. But this jeep has an unbelievable style. This item is a must to get.
"2014 Cherokee Trailhawk 3.2 v6 24 valve 9spd       I have had my 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk for exactly 1 year ,I have put nearly 9,000 miles on it and had zero problems. The 3.2 24 valve V6 seems to have more positive reviews than the 4 cyl ,to me its an suv with trail rated off road capabilities you need the V6 power ,when you switch from normal to sport for more aggressive driving it basically turns into a 5 speed and has a ton of power ,regular driving I use the 9 speed auto and get great fuel mileage ,every where I go I get comments on it ,the way it looks the way the V6 sounds the leather dash seats ,wheel etc its an awesome ride and I traded in my grand Cherokee overland w/V8 hemi !Would take Trailhawk hands down over the grand"
"Nice vehicle but no heat on passengers side.  Cold feet!  I really like my jeep.  Deciphers comfortably and good fuel economy.
 We have gone into the service dept. dodge summit Fredericton NB on two occasions and both times they said their computer was broke and couldn't complete the upgrade.  Problem with Bluetooth connection and salt elite radio reception.
 My biggest compliant is that poor heat on the passengers side.  My freeze all the time, but the drivers side is toasty warm. Service Center said there wasn't anything wrong.  The vent for the heat is literally 2 inch in diameter."

"The new Mustang is AWESOME  If you test drive it, you'll probably buy it. Holds the road so well, even my v6 has plenty of power, I was honestly surprised at how close it is to the 5.0 v8. I really have no complaints so, it's just a fun car."

My Horse  This car is really a pleasure to drive.  It is every thing that I expected and more.  I find the cloth seats very supportive and comfortable.  As with every generation of Mustang the back seats are very tight.  Love the handling as it has improved over previous models.

"Midlife Crisis  Wanted something quick when I wanted it to go. Turbo 4 was quick without hesitating. I know V8 has faster 0-60 but turbo 4 was fast enough for me and gets better mph especially highway. Low to the ground but easier for me to get in and out than Camaro. I really wanted a corvette but felt foolish falling out of the car every time I exited because it's too low. Also you can see out the back window much better than Camaro or Corvette. Less blind spots. I drove a lot of cars and decided on mustang because of best combination of performance, comfort, looks and price for me."

"She's exactly what I wanted  My 2006 Mustang GT is my seventh Mustang and by far, the best. The car runs 13's in the quarter, gets over 20mpg, sounds great, and is a blast to drive. Not the best handling car on the road, not the fastest either, but a solid platform that you can make into whatever kind of Mustang you would like. Tons of after market support including: wheels and tires, body kits, suspension system upgrades, power upgrades like blowers, turbos, nitrous oxide injection, super chargers cams, heads, etc...  You take care of your Mustang and she'll take care of you. I run premium fuel and full synthetic oil. Follow the maintenance guidelines, don't be cheap and skip over expensive services. "
"It Doesn't Get Any Better  Best Mustang GT ever!!!  I look forward to driving it, starting it and just looking at it!  I've been researching this vehicle for two year (2015), but I've been a fan since the 80s.  I didn't purchase it until last night.  REALLY!!! Over the past 4-5 months, I was looking at the prices drop.  Knowing the 2018 is right around the corner, I waited, but I couldn't wait any longer!  I even tried to wait until the end of the month to save a few more $$, but I turn 50 on 28 Sep and the pressure at the end of the day was crazy.  I got the ""green"" light from the wife to pull the trigger and the next day I was at the dealership with check in hand.  Dark gray, black wheels with the black accent package...""It Doesn't Get Any Better""!!!"

"Impressive engineering  I have owned the car for less 7 months and have put on 2300 miles so far. The car is equipped with a six speed automatic. It is silver and  is beautiful to look at and well engineered by Ford. I love the smoothness and power of the V6.  The car is a pleasure to drive around town or on the highway. It feels solid and sounds great with a slight rumble, especially on start up. I think Ford has made a huge mistake in phasing out the V6 in the Mustang for 2018. If anything, Ford should tweak the engine a bit more to keep up with the Camaro V6. I chose the Mustang over the Camaro for its looks , styling and better visibility and pricing. I chose the ingot silver and have had lots of compliments on the car at gas stations and parking lots, etc. I am thrilled with every aspect of this car except for the lack of leg room in the back seat and the lack of a spare tire. Ford seems to think an air pump in the trunk will get you home rather than providing a donut spare tire. I ordered a spare tire on line which is happily in my trunk in the event of a flat.  Ford needs to reevaluate sending its customers out on the road without the proper equipment to drive home safely. Great car, great pricing, great engineering. Be sure  to ask for a spare tire before you conclude your deal for a new or used 2017 V6 Mustang! (Look around there are still some new V6's on dealers' lots)"

"The longer I own it the less I like it.  I've owned the car about a month and while I still love the car I feel that Ford cheaped out on a few things. My biggest beef is that while cleaning the black wheels this evening with a wash cloth it scratched the wheels. This was just an average run of the mill CLEAN wash cloth and it put micro scratches in the finish. It is going to be an added cost to clear coat them so the finish lasts longer than a few months. I'm not using the cheap cloth seat belt loops so the seat belt has started to leave little scuff marks on the driver door where it knocks against it when I take the seat belt off. This is my fourth Mustang and even when I haven't used the seat belt loops in the past the belt did not mar up the door like it is in this car. The console gets HOT! Don't expect to keep a cold drink cold in the cup holders because there is a severe shortage of insulation under there. The manual shifter is clunky and unimpressive and I will swap it out as soon as I can. I'm a tall guy and it's a long way getting in and out but that's the price you pay for a car of this sort. Great power and ride is good for a sporty muscle car, not to smooth but not too rough either. I have a sneaking suspicion that the cheap plastic trim pieces will not hold up well over time, especially if you use the car alot (which I won't be). Stereo is sufficient but unimpressive. I purchased the black out option, spare tire and black roof and am overall happy with my purchase. Since I baby my car and only drive it about 6 months out of the year it should hold up fine. I wouldn't use it as my full time daily driver however."

"Mustang Ecoboost  This is the first vehicle that I personally owned, I wanted something strong, yet fuel efficient.  This Ecoboost is a dream.  Pick up is amazing, smooth changing of the gears.  I was worried due to the fact that I had back issues, but once getting in and out was not an issue, and it was comfortable.  I bought the vehicle for me to drive just myself and maybe  friend around, so the back seat (or lack of) does not concern me to much.  My only true nit pick is the lack of an Auxiliary port.  A lot of these new vehicles want strictly Blue Tooth for hands off, but i prefer to have more of an option for it."

"Sadly my 2011 Outshines my 2017  I loved my 2011 so much when my son took it off to college I bought myself a 2017. Sadly the 2017 seems like a step backwards. The gas mileage is worse, the plastic exterior parts are cheap and fragile (simple freeway stone blew a hole in the front, another piece was broke by a simple shopping cart bump), the interior has terrible design errors (i.e. the seat bracing connecting back to bottom grinds into you when you exit the car (broke the cell phone in my back pocket), the plastic and cloth features scuff at every light touch, and they glued felt on the seat belt buckle to solve a clacking noise where it banged against the center console. I would have easily given my 2011 5-stars... I struggle to give the 2017 more than 3 but it does have great engine power, looks amazing, and will hopefully be as reliable in the end as my 2011. Ford, see what you can do about actually improving the model (features/performance) from year to year."

"Best Mustang Yet!  Just purchased the Mustang, V6, auto, last week.  Impressive car.  I have owned 11 mustangs in the past and this is by far the most capable mustang yet.  The V6 has plenty of power and the transmission shifts at just the right times.  The independent rear suspension is great and provides an aggressive yet comfortable ride.  Although I haven't put too many miles on the car yet, averaging 24.5 mpg with a 60/40 mix of in-town and freeway driving.  This is great.   The interior is very good with soft materials where you want them and the seats are very supportive and comfortable.  Impressive implementation of the instrumentation.  I am sad that this is the last year for the V6 as it is a great engine and is a fantastic performer.  I found the 4cyl loud under load and at times clumsy on the test drive and I feel Ford is making a big mistake removing the V6 from the engine lineup.   Overall, I have a big smile on my face and am enjoying the ride.  I am looking forward to putting the mustang through its paces on a trip this summer on route 66."

"Love my 50th Anniversary Mustang  Wanted to own Mustang forever, practicality and utility always won and I ended up with either a 4 door sedan or an SUV.  Life's too short to live with regrets so I made a decision and found my 2015 50th Anniversary Mustang in Wimbeldon white. The sound of that V8 is music to my ears and never fails to put a smile on my face. She gets washed 3-4 times a week and ois always lookng her best. Best decision I ever made!  Now only if the gas mileage could improve I wouldn't find myself at the gas station so often."

"Looks & drives nice, but........  Check out your car very well before purchasing. It is obvious that Ford still does not care about quality after all of these years & why I avoided them for most of my life. The car I have is twisted. The driver's side door is warped. The hood is extremely hard to open because it barely opens far enough to get small fingers underneath to get to the release. The body lines do not line up. The dealership could do nothing about this and the repairs will require a body shop. I know this is a bad car that I bought, but these things should have been caught by Ford before being released from the factory! It wasn't noticed by me until I got the car home & really went over it that evening. The dealer is doing it's best to get it fixed by getting it to the right people, but it really should go back to Ford & I should get a replacement car. Other than the body/frame issues, the car drives great, handles great, looks great, nice power @ 305 HP, decent fuel economy and the front seats are comfortable. Can't say much for the back seat. The rear seats look great, but are useless. A child couldn't even sit back there. At least the trunk is very roomy. I like the car, but it will most definitely be my last Ford."

"Have your cake and eat it too!  We ordered our's Labor Day of '05 and picked it up in Nov. Power, handling, MPG, looks are all amazing. At first, the MPG was awful but it's only temporary. After the break in period, I've seen as high as 26 MPG (at avg. 77 MPH) and regularly get 23-24 MPG on my commute (1/3 city 2/3rds Hwy). I suspect, it could go as high as 30 MPG on a long trip and a moderate 65mph but don't think I never put my foot in it. Plenty have tried but no one has beat me in stop light drags. Handling is surprising for solid rear axle, but would prefer a proper independent rear suspension. There are downsides, heavy doors, squeaks & rattles from dash but this is one of the most pleasurable cars on the road!"
"GT PREMIUM WITH PERFORMANCE PACK  I bought this car in December of '16 after a wait of over 2 years. This is my third Mustang i have owned in the last 35 years. This car has really matured since my old '86 gt I had years ago. The car is larger and drives larger than both my '86 and my '02 GT I had to sell before buying this Mustang, yet it far out handles both of them (my 02 GT had about 4k in aftermarket upgrades in both engine mods and suspension).  The only real complaint about the car is the ingress and egress for me. I am 6'4"" and you have to be fairly flexible to get in and out. Once you are in though, the car fits like a glove, the shifter falling right into place, the steering wheel can be adjusted to taste and everything is very simple to use. The standard leather seats are outstanding, and after taking a 6-1/2 hour trip up to Napa from So. Cal, the seats gave my wife and I plenty of support and the heating and cooling feature is great! As for the performance...my mustang is plenty quick, but I don't drive it to be a drag racer. I wanted a true GT. The handling is more than adequate with the performance package, and the six piston Brembos are superlative. There is a reason why Mustangs have been around for over 50 years. Ford has obviously found a formula of performance, comfort, and style and blend it together in a fashion that other American car manufacturers try to emulate, but always come up short in one or more of these categories, missing the mark on Ford's pony car and what it represents.Edmunds has requested that I update my review of my Mustang GT Premium with the performance package. Here you go. Everything I wrote in the above original comments 8 or 9 months ago, still holds true. This car is a pleasure to drive and it puts a smile on my face every day. Rowing through the gears in Southern California with or without traffic has never been so much fun. I have had the opportunity to let others drive it and they all walk away saying, ""Nice drive!"" or ""This car is some serious fun!""  Of course, like me, they also have a smile on their faces after they are done driving it."

"Zoom zoom, 2017 Ford Mustang, 5.0 Automatic  I test drove the Chevy Camaro, Dodge Challenger, and Nissan 370Z.  All the listed had advantages and disadvantages. Also read several magazine articles/reviews, which favored the Mustang as a daily driver, and then took the Mustang for a few more test drives and for me the Ford Mustang 5.0 GT Premium, black on black with blacked out emblems and automatic transmission won hands down.  All around a more driver friendly car, but definitely still plenty of muscle for the road to include back roads.  Felt more comfortable for the longer drives, and the fit and finish to include a nicely appointed interior definitely sold me to the Ford.  I don't consider myself a Ford guy, but after driving the Mustang I decided I had to own one.  To date I've driven it to the NYC area, and it was very comfortable for three hours each way, and very soon to Daytona to attend the Rolex 24.  I've only owned it since late December 2016 so there are a number of areas on this survey I can't yet speak to...but I'm definitely hoping they are just as strong in the positive as my experience so far.UPDATE: Sold the 2017 and purchased a 2018 Ford Mustang loaded with all the new bells & whistles.  New 2018 GT Premium, also in Black, 10 speed transmission, active exhaust, magnadrive suspension, full digital instrumentation, performance package, etc. 1200 miles since purchase.UPDATE: Still very happy with the 2018 Mustang overall, but hugely disappointed on how overly difficult it is to get money back regarding the extended warranty.  Bought the 18 model last November 2017, and have had to get the the Ford Warranty division via snail mail.  They provided no other contact method other than snail mail.  If I had it to do over again I would not have ever purchased the extended warranty. My advice at this point unless you really know that you will keep the car for as long as the purchased warranty, DON'T do it.  At this point I'd give them a bunch of choice words.  The person who I've had some email contact with recently won't provide any updates to me.  I've provided all the necessary documents, and now nothing.  You mean to tell me this information wasn't in the system?  This is definitely poor, poor, business practices, and likely the second and last Ford I'll ever buy.  Enjoying the car, but at this point hating the company.  They will take all your money in a heart beat, and then make it time consuming, and nearly impossible to hold them accountable.  Ford, your business practices suck!  You've lost another customer.  We are done!"

"Best Mustang Ever  I just received my 2017 Mustang GT Premium that was ordered back in March.  I ordered it with the performance package, premium leather and the 6 speed manual transmission.  This is my first Mustang that I have ordered and I do have to say the wait was longer then I expected.  When the car finally came in, the dealer was excellent in getting it ready for me to pick up.  The interior is very nice and well thought out - the only down side is there is not a whole lot of room in the back seats.  That is about the only negative I can say about the interior.  I ordered the premium leather with the red accents and they are very comfortable and look GREAT!  The 5.0 Coyote is one strong motor.  It has all the power and go that you will need.  Very strong and very quick.  When you step on it, it wakes up and you will be through the gears before you know it.  Very impressed.  All I can say, Ford did a wonderful job on this car.  This is a true American Muscle Car.  It is built from the ground up to be a Mustang and no other chassis in the Ford line up shares any parts of it.  Great Muscle Car!!"

"Ford makes a good mustang?  Yes, They do! finally a mustang for modern America.  With the new suspension in the rear this car drives! Instead of the old mustangs where going into a corner meant ending up at the coroner's, this mustang lets you power through in control. Fun to drive with a stiff but yet forgiving ride.  Can't wait to take this to the track, both the drag and the road track. This does not however mean it's all roses for the new mustang.  The interior leaves you wanting and thinking why? For example there are very few fake aluminum-plastic lookalike pieces, 5 switches 2 accents and the cowling around each primary air vents. With so few of these items why not use real aluminum? It would have increased the cost by 60 bucks so it leaves me saying why? Secondly the GT coyote engine suffers from a lack of tech. Ford makes the all amazing ford GT which has an engine that has the capability to turn off cylinders, and has the red light ""stop start"" function, these or at the very lest the ""stop start"" should be a must for this engine and would help massively with fuel eco.  That being said the noise the cayote engine makes and the power it produces is something that must be experienced to believe!Two year update:Mods:X-force Mustang GT cat-back exhaust.Piston support for the hood.Rouche open air intake.I am still in love with my mustang, and now with the adjustable exhaust it can be extremely aggressive or, for my neighbours quiet and restrained. The open air intake completes the engine bay along with the support pistons for the hood I no longer need the hood prop stick.  Taken a few long road trips and this is the mustang you want.. some times the computer is not the greatest system but with Apple car play I rarely interface with the base systems. Any negatives would be one of the plastic trunk latch covers has broken off, but I use this mustang to transport 2x4(s) for home projects and servers from DC to DC so I use and abuse the trunk and with all that use one broken plastic cover is honestly a surprise I was expecting far worse. An improvement would be soft touch closing trunk would be awesome and a sun/moon roof or all glass roof like the Jag F type would put this mustang over the top.  Two years in and my opinion has not changed the 2017 mustang GT is the best mustang that has been made since 1968, and well worth anyone’s consideration! Good luck in the hunt for the car that suits you!"

"Topless extravaganza  I love my car.  I bought it about a month ago.  I love the air conditioned seats on driver and passenger side.  Dual temp control, awesome sound system.  Power seats up front (both sides).  The most fun you can have with your clothes on.  I got the 4 cylinder turbo, plenty of power and great gas mileage.  I wouldn’t trade it for anything else.  My wife and I cruise up ou down the coast every weekend.  Everywhere we go, someone comments on how beautiful it is.  I purchased it a year old, so it’s already broken in, and affordable."

"I would have expected much more.  Purchased the car less than a year ago. Upside it is fun to drive. Downside is the dealer response to reported issues. Rear windows would not close completely and added to an already loud cruise experience. RH rear window fell inside of quarter panel. Nice. Took to Ft. Myers dealer, reported that and was fixed. Reported poor AC performance, not fixed, now it doesn’t work at all. Reported rear camera not working. Fixed, now it works sparratically, after all, I only need it in reverse :( Reported ambient temp read out inaccurate. Not fixed. Reported seat coolers very inefficient, service guy says they are OK. Speedometer drops off, dealer couldn’t duplicate, so it must be OK too. Seat memory system is forgetful, dealer couldn’t duplicate, so it must be OK. Tell that to my shorter than me wife. New one this week, dash dimmer switch activates all by itself, can hardly wait to listen to dealer on this one."

"Great Rental Car but would hate to own  When driving the hood design is very high up and parts of the hood block your view.  Track and Sport mode pretty much cannot be used on the street unless you like cruising at 4-5K Rpm.  Normal mode is nice however.  With traction control off you really cannot spin the tires due to excessive amount of turbo lag and poor low end torque range.  There is so much information in the computer, most of which you will never use and some basic information like a digital display of speed is missing.  Now for a convertible driving with either the top up or down is pretty quiet and comfortable. This is a 30 day rental so I have put it through the paces.  For 300+ Hp and Torque plus turbo you would expect more.  My old 2003 Nissan 350 with 287hp would have destroyed this car.  Last thing that is really disappointing.   This has seat heaters and seat coolers.  On high neither does hardly anything.  Most the time I cannot even tell they are on at all and neither can my girlfriend and she is very sensitive to temperature changes.  Overall a pretty fun rental but would never consider owning."

"I rented one for a Month!  I rented an Ecoboost  in Tucson, AZ and drove it to Chicago, IL and back. I put over 4,000 miles on it. The 4 cylinder engine has a lot of Power, especially on the high end. This Car is a ""Total Blast"" to drive, I just wish the driver seat reclined."

"used to love it...  I wanted the gt for many years, so I finally traded in my Mitsubishi for a 06 tungsten grey mustang gt. Ran great for about 2 months, then the problems started to occur... Ford services departments no matter where you go are no help, your better off saving time and money by going to an aftermarket shop to have any work done. I have owned it for a year and am done putting time and money into it. Though you can customize the car to any extent your better off getting a Dodge, Toyota, anything other than a ford."
Best selling sports car in the world!  Because of this. Discounts on new Mustangs are very hard to find.

Surprised me!  When I wentMustang shopping I was leaning toward a six cyl. But after driving the Eco boost I was SOLD on the 4 cyl.!  I am in my early 70's and at first thought I was too old and should buy a more old-fartish kind of car but after driving this hot little pony I made up my mind I was going to feed the kid in me!  My wife?  She loves it!!!

"A Pound for Pound Bargain  My overall rating would have been higher had the V8 engine been available with a shutdown feature at highway speeds to increase overall mileage. The Corvette has it. I bought the car 9/7 and put 10K miles on it by 3/1. It came with the 265/35/20 tires and they really hold the road. Replacements will be in  the close to $300 each range but they have a 500 wear rating and roll out smooth. The pre-settings on the driver power seat allows for easy exit and entrance. The interior is well done and high quality. The car is surprisingly quiet with top up or down. I bought the Mustang because I need as much trunk space as possible for my trips and unlike the hardtop convertibles, the Mustang top folds onto itself with no intrusion into an almost full size trunk. The top goes up and down quietly and fast. I downgraded the Navigation system because there is no way to alphabetize your Favorites or eliminate previous destinations individually. There is a myriad of options in the gauges and lighting features. The engine data that is displayed is far beyond the average driver. The car is a bargain in today's market. Options included automatic with paddle shifters, Nav system, tire pkg, upgraded interior, 120,000 mile warranty."

"Rented One, Want One  My wife and I got this car as a loaner for our regular car's recall replacement. I've never owned a performance auto, but have been a long time motorcyclist, and have owned several high performance 2-wheelers. This Mustang blows me away. The acceleration is awesome. I drove across a mountain range on a very twisty section of interstate, and have to say that was the most fun I have ever had on 4 wheels. It was solidly planted, the steering was very precise; I could easily change lines mid-curve; acceleration out of the curves was very controlled. With the top up, it feels like an upscale touring car. With the top down, it is simply sexy as h***. We're now planning to sell our SUV, and buy a new Mustang. Life is short."

"Not a replacement, but a whole new automobile!  Update: I had to trade in this car on a new Honda CRV Touring.  I just could not get out of it any more. My joints were in rebellion, so I am just too old (68) for this car with deep and low bucket seats.  In fact, when I showed the CRV to my Aunt and Uncle, they went and traded in their Lincoln Town Car on the exact same thing. My Aunt was able to get out with no effort at all with her bad knees. That is the ONLY problem I had with using the 2017 Mustang, but it was enough.  It also depreciated heavily in 7 months, from $42K to $24K KBB trade!  That part is disgusting, but you get nothing for all the add-ons...beware! Otherwise, as my personal car, it was the best car I ever owned for fun and for comfortable traveling while in it. So read on...Original review starts here:  I loved my 2014 Mustang convertible (read the review), so I got a new 2017 to have all of the active safety features and other convenience tech. What I got was something that is a huge step up in quality.  In fact, a different machine, with the feel of the BMWs (Mustang handles better in my opinion - test them) I tested and a huge leap above a Camaro.  It accelerates smoothly up to 121 mph (where it is electronically limited), gets up to 32 mpg on highway (with super unleaded, about 29-30 with regular).  Handles much better than the GT (again, try them out side by side - I did several times - GT feels front heavy and bulky). This drives like a sports car, nimble and quick (fun). And with a rear diffuser it hugs the road tighter at really higher speeds (over 100 mph) that I couldn't get near with the 2014 b/c the front end would start feeling lighter and drifting. Has plenty of storage, something lacking in the old Mustang and non-existent in Camaros.  The only things lacking is automatic braking (something I will demand in 3 years or I will switch models), and lane warning/assist.  The forward collision warning is great, but it just pre-loads brakes, probably a nod to the general macho among Mustang owners, but auto braking should be an option for those of us more concerned with being alive (and the safety of others) than imagined macho.  Another after market add on is a windscreen, which really makes a difference if you want to communicate or listen to the radio at highway speed.  It makes your car a two seater when in place, but I never have more than one lady friend at a time riding! :)  Easy to remove, but don't get this car for a backseat anyway.  One small feature I love is the center console which locks when you hit the door lock fob.  I leave the top down a lot when I go into a store. This combined with alarms keeps stray hands out that stuff.  All in all, a wonderful car.  After owning 6 convertibles and 4 of them Mustangs, this is way far best."

"The Ecoboost Premium Convertible  I noted most reviews were for GTs.  I own an Ecoboost Premium Convertible.  Acceleration is so-so.  Handling is incredible.  Only two complaints are the windows controls are too far forward and the antenna is awkward if you have a car cover but it unscrews solving that.  Radio actually works fine without it screwed back in.  The rear seats cannot be used for passengers but I knew that in buying it.  They do make good interior storage - something the old Z-3 I had was short of.  Gas mileage is killer.  I saw acceleration is ""so-so"" only due to my last car, a Lincoln LS with the V-8, being no slouch so the Ecoboost doesn't seem to add anything to that.  Compared to something else maybe it'd be more impressive.  So niggling complaints on what has proven to be an incredibly handling car with enough pop to satisfy.  Comfort on long drives is much better than expected - the Z-3 lacked in that department. Review says car acquired in 2016 as page doesn't have 2017 as an option - car was new in August of 2017."

2017 GT Premium Fun!  I used the Edmunds.com price to buy the car through the ford dealership fleet sales manager. It could not have been easier. The car is one month old now and it's a fun car to drive... Just put the top down and go!   I got the new platinum white color which I love because it has a nice pearl finish.

"Love my Mustang  I have owned 4 different Mustangs in my life and this is by far the best. Extremely reliable, great sound system, good gas mileage (Regular unleaded in my V6). I have had no problems with my car at all over the last 4 years - it still looks and runs like it's brand new. Everything inside and out has held up very well. I really have zero complaints."

"Good Buy  I'll be sad to see mine go. I've had BMW's, Camaro's, and Vettes, and this is by far my favorite car to date. Very reliable so far with only one problem (fuel gauge sensor) but otherwise a perfect all around car.  Not too fast (yes there is such a thing), but more than fast enough to get you in trouble on any road.  "
"New mustang same old story  Within a couple of days of getting the car I already had people ""hatin"" on it for no reason, something about these cars draws people to hate you for some reason it seems.  They aren't unreasonably slow but considering its a flagship v8 they are a bit slow vs their rival camaro.  These seem to be more of a tuner car ie people modify the looks to suit their taste and they typically don't care about being faster than their rivals or they just think they are faster but in fact are much slower.  The cars look great and are reasonably fast and priced well for what it is vs a camaro of the same year.  Ultimately you get what you paid for though.  I will likely trade this in down the line and upgrade to a camaro ss or corvette gs.  Until then I'll live with the mediocrity that is the mustang."

"14 GT Up to task!  So this is my 3rd GT, 1st was an '05 automatic which was bulletproof. 2nd was an '07 manual 5spd, great car. In Oct. '15 picked up this '14 used with 37k miles. Got a nice deal. Mileage was kinda high but I'm hoping this one will last me at least 4 more yrs. Have 65k miles now. So far this car has been great! Only real complaint is the clunky 2 piece transmission. It clunks sometimes going from 1st to 2nd gear and occasionally  3rd gear, especially driving normal. like just cruising around town. Also, when sitting in neutral, then shifting into 1st there is a thump. I was told the center carrier bearing was worn out because it flexes up and down, but I believe it does that purposely because of the 2 piece design. The car is rated at 420 HP, so power at the rear wheels is probably more like 380, maybe less, like 350. Despite the clunky trans, I've got 65k miles and she's been rock solid so far. I had to do a lot of driving for a sick relative where I was driving almost 3k a month for 4 months. Gas MPG went up during those trips. I was averaging almost 27-28 mpg, which I think is good for today's muscle car.  Definitely fun to drive, I just added Borla stingers on 8/2/17 and I'm so glad I did! Wow! I had MagnaFlow before which were ok, but the Borla really clears her throat, with no drone either!!!!! I'm not gonna complain about the backseat or plastics in the interior. I didn't buy it for that. I will say no spare tire. I need to address that. If I get a flat, then I'll be waiting for the Tow truck. I'll probably buy one soon. If your looking for a V8 muscle car on a budget, I'd say the mustang gt will check every box you need. Challengers are heavier, you can't see out of the Camaro's. Mustang's have the right mix of streetability and performance with bang for your buck. As far as gas goes, I usually run 87, then 91 every 5th tank or so. I always run full synthetic oil. Usually get about 7500-8500 miles between changes."

"Great car for the money  I purchased my 2014 GT (base) manual trans with only 3,000 miles on it in November, 2016.  Guy before me drove it 1,000 miles every year for the first three years, and decided to trade it in for a Ford Escape.  I've put a tad over 3,000 miles on it myself, and have added a Roush axleback exhaust, Barton short throw shifter w/ two piece mounting bracket, and aftermarket 20"" staggered wheels/tires.  I was surprised to see so few reviews on this model car considering it is already 3 years old. My impressions so far:  The car is a great bang for your buck sports car.  The power is NOT immediate, though, when you step on the gas.  As another reviewer noted, you'll need to get the engine above 4k rpm to really notice any significant pull.  Below 4k rpm the car seems sluggish.  But if you are on the highway and shift down and get in that rpm range above, 4k, you will NOT think the car is sluggish anymore :).  If you go with the manual trans, YOU WILL NEED to get an aftermarket shifter.  I've driven tons of manual trans vehicles in my life and the stock shifter on my 2014 mustang gt may have been THE WORST shifter out of any car I've ever driven.  HORRIBLE feel, long shifts, MISSED shifts (even when not 'getting on it'), and inferior parts make up the qualities of the stock shifter.  I purchased a Barton shifter with two piece bracket that mounts to the trans.  My good friend and I installed in about an hour or hour and a half.  NIGHT AND DAY difference.  The Roush axleback exhaust is also highly recommended, and I also installed that myself.  Again, night and day difference.  Quiet when cruising with zero highway drone, but open her up and it's pure bliss.  Overall the car could use-in my opinion-a lower ride height from the factory.  Interior quality is meh....lots of hard plastics.  But who cares, I bought a Mustang, not a luxury car.  I cannot attest to reliability yet, because my car is only sitting at 6,200 miles.  Factory LED headlights and fog lights are BRIGHTEST lights I've ever had in any car.  I mistakenly drove the whole way home with just the fogs on one night.  Didn't even realize it until I got into my driveway.  They are truly that bright (and I get high beamed every time I drive the car b/c people think the fog lights are high beams and it must hurt their eyes...).  If you are looking for a good performance car for the $$, go for the 2014 Mustang GT.  You won't be disappointed.  A few things are a must to modify (see shifter comment...), but that's the case in most cars.  Hope this review helps.  Oh, I don't daily drive mine (anything but...), but I combine to get around 16.5 mpg, and that's with some spirited driving."

"What the automotive magazines should tell shoppers  Model - 2014 Mustang GT Premium with the 5.0L V8 and the 6 spd manual.  Engine - Excellent rendition of a smooth Japanese V8 with DOHC and VTec, but it lacks the torque and immediacy of the old 5.0L small block.  You will need to rev the engine well beyond 4k rpm to realize any benefit over a V6 sedan.  Transmission - The 6 speed MT-82 Getrag is a huge disappointment.  Not only is it produced in China with inferior parts and construction, but the shifter is remotely mounted making  gear changes a nightmare when the vehicle is side loaded.  When you combine the remote mounted shift mechanism with the stock Turkish sourced clutch assembly (that can't handle the full rpm range of the engine) you end up with a non-performer.  Expect to be locked out of gear while the clutch pedal sits stuck to the floor anytime you're shifting over 6k rpm with the stock components.  Attached to the transmission is a heavy two-piece driveshaft, which was needed when Ford went to the short MT-82.  The clunks you will hear during stop and go traffic are caused by its excess weight and play in the joint.  Some people are able to adjust their clutch engagement method to dampen the severity of the noise.  Brakes - Find a model with the track package containing up-sized Brembo calipers.  The stock GT brakes are adequate once you get used to the soft squishy pedal sinking to the floor on hard stops.  Steering - This model came with numb electric power steering.  There are 3 modes to adjust the weight, but the system just reduces the electric assist instead of providing actual feedback.  Don't hop from a sports car into the Mustang expecting a road course ready car.  Ford provides a good engine with a car wrapped around it and expects the owner and aftermarket suppliers to perform the engineering and troubleshooting that should have been done at the factory.  All the problems have solutions, but not all owners will have the time or money to implement them."

"After 3 years, no regrets!  On the 4th of July weekend, 2014, I went shopping for a new sports car.   My budget was under $25k, not including my $9k trade-in.  The V6 Camaro was the easiest to drive, but lacked visibility.  The Dodge Challenger was the smoothest ride but only the V6 was within my budget.  The Mustang GT has a 420 HP V8, 6 speed auto, and was the same price as the other two and way more fun to drive.  Looking back over the last three years I have no regrets.  I think my 2014 'live axle'  GT looks better, sounds better, is quicker in the 1/4 mile straight run, and feels like it has more room for the driver, than the 'independent rear' 2015+ model Ford replaced it with.  The Ford Mustang GT is the 'most-bang-for-the-buck' new muscle car you can buy today."

Living with a 2014 Mustang GT  Great performance.  Original springs and shocks not up to max performance.  Eibock lowering springs and Bilstien shocks make performance of suspension 100% better.  This 5.0 is the best motor that Ford has ever made.  Back seat is just not roomy enough.  Recarro seats are perfect in front.  Overall this is a fun car to drive.  Fuel milage is terrible around town but I have gotten as high as 29mpg on the interstate..  One complaint I have is that the rev limiter comes up too fast. For the price this is a good performance car..

"Fun Fast Ride!  I read a lot about Mustangs being I've owned mine for over 2 years and they seem to get a bad rap.  I however love mine and wouldn't trade it for anything else unless I could get the same performance out of a 5th generation Firebird as I love their look.  I've had no troubles or concerns with this car except the visibility of seeing who's beside you on the road.  I got used to using the spot mirrors that came with the car so that's not really an issue anymore.  I've made some tight turns and have traversed from one edge of the road to the other and the car handles with finesse.  As to what those other crazies are doing out there causing accidents, I don't know.  Perhaps they're bad drivers.  The performance wasn't exactly to my liking as I wouldn't preferred an V8 GT but didn't want to pay all the extra cash for one.  True this car is limited to 118mph but if you get yourself a digital tuner, you can take that off.  Thus far I'm am sitting happy with a sport tune with speed limit set to around 130mph and cold air intake which I modified myself for max flow and a set of Goodyear TripleTreds for any driving condition.  I am good to go!  If I have money someday I'll get a higher endurance drive shaft, higher speed rated tires, headers and exhaust as well as a spoiler and a sport stripe.  But for now I'm happy as I can beat most cars on the road and ride in comfort when I feel like cruising.  I've only been beaten by a higher profile BMW, Mercedes Benz, and a Charger R/T that someone obviously forked out a lot of cash to increase performance.  Heck, my brother has one with racing tires, tune, and cyclone cold air intake and beat him.. wasn't easy.. he had me off the line but I caught up to him.  All in all this is a great performance car and I tire of all the people who have something bad to say about it.  Hey I respect all vehicles:  Camaros, Chargers, Challengers, Lancers, Imprezas, etc... I like them all but I love my car and it's a blast.  Someday I'll have to take it to the track.  Tried at Chuckawala but never got around to getting the gear which includes a racing helmet and suit and a fire extinguisher.  I just wanted to lap it around a couple times and compare it to the others that have done so. LOL  All I can do now it race others on the street when both them and I feel like it, but that's in open conditions with other people on the street = not safe.  Sorry getting off topic here. LOL.. in a nutshell it's a good well rounded speedy car which can become a monster if you know how to tap into its resources.  Thanks for listening."

"Mustang Expert  Ok so I bought my car in 2014 when it was ""brand new"" so ive had it somewhere between 2-3 years and the odometer sits at 38,000 currently. It is a v6 3.7, the power that these cars put out for what it is is phenomenal. It is beyond a step of the older generations of course. I have raced GT v8s of the older gens and have either stayed equal or passed them up by a bit which is quite impressive considering those don't get the gas mileage that I get. The interior of the car is great but definitely could be better, if youre comparing to the 2015+ years then it feels old and outdated of course but its still a great and comfortable interior. The only downside id say about the interior is that the plastic does creek, its annoying but probably repairable if youre dedicated enough as well as not much back seat space but if you bought or are buying this car for a family car then you need to get your priorities straight. Another thing that kind of bothered me is my water pump went out at about 30k miles (probably just faulty from factory because others never had that issue) and my warranty covered it so I cannot hold that against Ford. But if there is one thing that I do hold a grudge is that my local dealer has poor customer service, and it seems that everytime I go there its a bunch of nonsense with them but I digress. Overall if youre looking to get the best of both worlds for a sports car that you can daily drive then this is your car, the options you can throw on later down the line if you choose is almost endless, they make performance and styling parts for this car like crazy so you could always make your ride unique to you if you choose to, and its pretty affordable to if youre comparing it to other things out there."

"Car is great. Interior, not so much.  I had an '05 GT premium throughout college and beyond. Red with red leather interior... it was BEAUTIFUL. And until the transmission blew after just 80K miles, it drove like a dream. After shelling out $2k+ for a new tranny, I decided to bid adieu to my beauty and get something more practical. I guess I used that term loosely because that was a '14 Mustang V6. As far as the engine goes, the only thing I missed about the V8 was its rumble. The V6 has more than enough power and is fun to drive!However, the interior is a different story. My advice to anyone looking to buy a 2014 is to pay the extra grand or so and get a premium. It is WORTH IT. I made a big mistake by getting the base model. I thought it would be OK because I'm not really into all the bells and whistles, especially on a Mustang (it's all about that engine, right?!) , but the quality of the interior is horrible. Everything is plasticy and cheap: the chrome accents in the dash are plastic (really, Ford?), the dash also looks like someone just snapped it together, there's big gaps everywhere. Because of this, it makes a ton of noise. Every time I pinpoint and fix a rattle in the dash, a new one emerges. I used to love to turn off my radio so I could listen to the engine, but now I have to blast music when i drive so the constant rattling doesn't drive me nuts. I'm at the point where I want to sell the car. Ford, please fix this in future Mustangs. The base models don't need all the bells and whistles, but they deserve to be made with quality that matches what's under the hood."

Excellent Value  I bought the 2006 Azera Limited in June of 2007 after it came off of a lease. It has been the most enjoyable car I have ever owned (I’m in my late 60’s). My only negative comment is the suspension could be better on rough roads.
Don't even waste your time looking much less buyin  Electrical nightmare.  Dealer cost for repairs are thru the roof. But Honda or Toyota
"Great car  Great car, great ride, would have better mileage with a six speed transmission as I think it would be underpowered if it was equipped with a four cylinder."
Best car ever  I absolutly love my Azera. The performance is unmatch in its class. I haven't had any issues with anything. I've not experienced the problems others are mentioning about how it handles bump. The luxury interior is unmatched for its class also. I would recommend this car to everyone. Just go drive one and you will be a believer also.
"Good value for luxury  We have had our 2006 Azera from nearly new (3500) miles when we bought it. Overall it has been a great car, for the price at the time purchased it was a bargain with luxury that surprised us. The fuel economy has been fair to good, the ride and comfort good. I would like to compare a 2016-17 Azera to see what if any improvements have been made.I have heard the the dealership the Azeri is to be discontinued/phased out."
"Sad but True....not worth it  I have owned my car for 3 years. Wanted one since I was a kid. Very unhappy. Squeaks and rattles in the dash, window tint scratches when rolled down, spoiler comes lose constantly, vibration in front end that no one can seem to fix, new rattle in suspension, beginning to have trouble with the drive train, carpet and leather wear terribly, windows are beginning to leak when washed, more wind noise etc. This car was garage kept and babied, there is no excuse for this horrible quality. Though it was fun to drive and gets lots of look I will likely never buy Ford again! Go with the Honda, Toyota, Acura, Lexus or what ever else you are looking at!"
"Super car  Great little car with a few extras in it that the base model doesn't have.Picked up 2 mustangs for the price of our one sedan prior. Wife got this one and I picked up a 2010 with a v6 5speed.Hers has way more options and goodies on it and seeing her grin from ear to ear when we bought it made the whole process worth it.This car is up on power but let me say that with a stick these cars are nearly identical on acceleration. There are slight differences in the 2 bodies and the major ones come in the form of features... sequential tail lights, Bluetooth, sync... her car has enough to keep her spoiled with no navigation which isn't necessary for her.The zip from the motor is awesome and the cornering on hers is phenomenal.... very fun to drive :)Great job on the updates fordUPDATE 20171116:Have since purchased a different 2014 Mustang for my wife that has all the same basic features but added the track package with leather and had been upgraded visually only moderately. same basic car and still love the way it drives and handles. Still has all the same characteristics of the old car with more style and visual appeal. I'd like to imagine the car was so good we wanted a better version of it and now she has it :).since owning the last car we've found that with a really good set of tires it handles very well in the snow with minor slipping when you press the gas too hard and as long as the snow isn't over 6-7 inches there isn't really much to worry about as with any other car you may drive.other than that my review hasn't changed and its still a very amazing car"
"Exactly what a car should be  You really need to drive one the 2006-2011 Azeras. The ride is unbelievably perfectly balanced for people who realize they won't be taking corners at 100+mph and no car can make a 10inch deep pothole disappear. If you want a car with good speed, but no drama getting there....this is the car. The ride feel like smooth and quiet, yet alive enough to let you know what the road is like underneath you (my guess is the complaints about ride comfort come from people used to buick marshmallows). We've had this beauty for almost a decade and had absolutely zero issues. Kept her outside in snowy, salty climate and no rust anywhere. None of the drivers in our house have led-foot-itis so we can attest to 20mpg ""suburb"" being the norm (I did notice a drop down to 19mpg the week I needed to go in to the city for jury duty). Seriously, this car is perfect. It has superb visibility, go ahead and compare it to one of those dreadful new cars with window sills nearly at shoulder height. We drove this car through ice storms and blizzards with no problems (as long as you keep traction control OFF). I am completely in love with this car. So bright and cheerful and I swear it just loves to be driven. We got the base model with the rather unusual upholstery, but good lord this stuff is comfortable. It never heats up in the summer nor does it ever feel frigid in the winter, to heck with leather.... I've actually grown to love just sitting in the passenger seat while the others shop. (The great sound system compliments the relaxing seats very well too) Oh yeah, the usable cargospace is unsurpassed....thrift stores and consignment furniture shops have been our favorite places since getting this car. How Hyundai did this car for the pricepoint is unimaginable, it completely destroys Avalons/Accords/Fusions/Impalas/MKS...and even my 5-series. You have to love this car."
"Honey Hyundia  This one of the best cars that I have ever owned. In my lifetime I have had 15 cars, 2 used and 13 new. This car without a doubt has been exceptional.It is going to be 10 years old soon and other that brakes, tires and batteries, nothing else has had to be replaced. The leather interior looks as good as the day  one, along with the body and paint. I haven't even had to change a light bulb. It is a great car!!!!"
Good as a used car  I bought the Azera as a less expensive alternative to an Avalon. I have had a disappointing (bad) experience with Hyundai National after problems with air bag. A local repair successfully fixed the problem after dealer missed the problem repeatedly. The Seat belt pre tensioners have been a problem possibly exacerbated by my purchase of used replacements. The rear power sunscreen failed at about 200K and replacing it is exorbitant. It handles very well and the fine touches are well executed. I am looking for another Azera.
2006 Azera LTD  We bought our 06 one owner Azera for my daughter.It had 93K miles but was well cared for.We have had the car for a year and the engine and interior are top notch.Highway mileage is 27 but in the city it is abysmal.The rear sunshade is a gimic and trouble prone.The car is solid and is a good value used as Hyundai's still don't hold their value as well as the Japanese cars but in my opinion are similar in quality.
"Great car!  This was my first car that I got for my 15th birthday. It is a great car. I see lots of reviews mentioning the harshness of bumps. Honestly, I don't see the problem. It rides so smoothly. The interior is amazing. Very classy steering wheel, plus very comfortable on the hands. It's got a list of very cool features. The steering wheel leans back when the car is turned off as if to get out of the driver's way. Heated seats, electrically powered seat adjusting, sun roof, etc. There is even a mile counter counting down to an empty gas tank. Speaking of gas, this must be the only feature less than excellent. The gas mileage could be slightly better. All in all, it's a really great car!"
Best car for any age!  I left my Lexus is250 to my mom when i moved and she got me an azera. At first it was a bit of a downer. However this car is a much better fit now that im a father. Great family car and preformance is awesome. I understand the complaint about ride comfort. Get different tires. Thats all. Sumitomo HTR Z III are cheap and amazing tires. you can get them for under 500 bucks for all 4. The Azera is my favorite car overall. 
"Fuel Mileage  I have read the reviews about the fuel mileage and don't seem to be getting the mileage in the 20's like people are reporting. In town I am getting 12 mpg I don't have a lead foot and don't do a lot of highway driving. Does anyone have suggestions as to what I can do to get better fuel mileage? Any idea as to what this ""download"" is that is mentioned in the review? "
Great car  I have owned the car eright at a year and I have enjoyed driving it.  For the price this is a great car.  The harshness in how it takes bumps is my only complaint. I had Nitrogen put in my tires and the ride improved a lot. I really enjoy driving it and for the money you can't buy this kind of luxury. 
"Great Car for the Money  I have owned my car for 3 1/2 years. Got a great price. At 55,000 miles, I still have 5,000 miles bumper to bumper warranty. Thus far, all I have needed done is my lumbar support on the driver side. When I get into my car I still feel like its a fun, luxurious drive. My family, including my father, has had five Hyundais (2 Accents, 1 Elantra, 1 Sonata, and 1 Azera) since 2003. No regrets.   "
"Enjoying it with reservations  Read all the reviews before buying it. could not get more than 14MPG, under any circumstances, hated that the key fob kept hitting the plastic dash and absolutely hated the ride. I was told to wait till I drove it a while before I can expect better gas mileage. At my first oil change, a young mechanic reinstalled the software that runs the engine and I immediately obtained 17.8 MPG around town and 27 MPG on the highway. I installed a plastic change purse over the key fob to silence the key chain. It worked. I stopped by another dealer to complain about the ride. He installed new shocks on the front and it now rides almost acceptably. I only have 8000 miles on it."
14 Body Style Coupe  The Mustang lends itself to an endless list of personalization/customizing! So many sources and never a dull momentHow many other models of any make have 50+ years of continuos production? Not Many! It's a popular car because it's FUN
"Great Car, Great Value  I have own this car for a few months and have really fallen in love with it.  The luxury and quality can not be beat for the price.  It is very comfortable with plenty of leg room.  This car is very responsive."
Phillys Finest  I drive an 06 Azera Limited with Ultimate package. Mines is silver with black leather interior with an upgraded wood kit through out the vehicle. I love just about everything about my car.
"Nice, no regrets  I have had mine for 3 1/2 years and love it. So far the only problem is a crack in the dashboard,which the dealer is replacing under the warranty. My brother bought the 2007 and his dashboard also cracked in the same place, on the passenger side where the airbag is located. Many owners complain about gas mileage but for its size 22mpg combined is not bad. I would highly recommend a Hyundai to anyone, its a good car and the company stands behind all of the models."
"Excellent value & quality for the money  Good daily driver that is also good highway traveler.  SHIFTRONIC transmission make driving in mountains of Colorado and Utah a pleasure and prevents overheating brakes. Engine, transmission and mechanical perform well in 110+ degree desert heat. Paint has held up well in cloudless sunny skies of Arizona. The battery needed replacement after 2 years, the coolant tank cracked (but did not leak) and the dash top cover cracked, and all were replaced free under warranty by dealer. The seat, foot pedal and steering column adjustments combined with the integrated memory system easily accommodates out 2 drivers who have an 8 inch height difference.  This Azera is 3 years old and has 30,000 miles"
"A Car to Consider  I had to replace my 97 Camry. Owning all kinds of cars in the past (Lexus- Benz-Honda-Audi) this one made sense. Things I love: safety features (airbags all around, stability and traction control + the usual - ABS etc.), power (250 hp), transmission (smooth, gear stays on until red zone if you hit it), comfort (seats, rear A/C - heat fan, illuminated power switches, auto up/down window for driver & pass), optional features (front & REAR reading lights, huge trunk, good stereo), and highway gas mileage (28). Major gripe: If you want a sporty car this is not it. On straight road it is great. BUT smooshy on curves (just like a Buick). Minor stuff: City MPG could be better. Buy used not new."
"problems  i have 45,000 miles on the car. overall, i like it very much. three problems i have had and other customers according to the dealer. the rear electronic window shade motor broke. the dash board has split around the passenger airbag twice now, and some problem with the timing chain recently which causes a rattling noise during a cold first start. all of these were politely fixed by the dealer, no questions asked. my car has consistently got 24.3 mpg, according to the computer."
"I laugh at BMW buyers  I am a previous owner of a 2000 Dodge Intrepid ES with the 3.2l engine. For about the same price as I paid for the Trep in 2000, I have a fully loaded LE that has so far been almost flawless. Now after 50,000 miles, I am still impressed. Initially I was scared to try Hyundai after my sister owned a Sonata back in the 90's, and that car literally fell apart. This car has been rock solid and I have only had 2 issues, and all were replaced free of charge by the dealership. The fact that this car has an excellent warranty and free roadside assist sold me. The car looks classy but a bit conservative. It rides a bit mushy but my second set of tires (Goodyear F1) has improved handling."
"After 80,000 mi. Its still like new  I drive a lot, and at 6,4"" it fits me great. I appreciate the power, standard features, and quality of the bodywork and paint. I'm going to keep it until it falls apart, then get another one. After having a Toyota Avalon, and comparing both, I went with the azera. Dealer has been great."
"Trip odometer resets  Someone wrote a review about their 2009 Azera having problems with trip odometer resetting.  Check the battery connections.  Mine was slighly loose.  Enough, however to cause this problem.  Just came back on 700 mile trip running 70 mph with air & traffic.  I got 28.4 mpg."
"Still a ""WOW""  This car has the quality, reliability and performance of a Lexus for thousands less. In 3 years, we've changed the oil and 1 light bulb. That's it! It goes like stink (that might explain the gas mileage), does it quietly (allowing us to truly enjoy the car's great audio system) all the while feeling secure (even our son loves how the car handles). Incredible Bang for the Buck. 3 people have bought an Azera on our recommendation and love their car as much as we do. Hyundai's Best Kept Secret."
Awsome Car  Let me just say I have always thought mustangs were over rated. I never accualy owned one until now and I see why they are so popular. I traded my 2007 toyota tacoma in to get my 2014 Mustang convertible priemium v6. It is black with black convertible top and black leather seats. Its a gorgeous car. Nothing but complements were ever I go. It handles great and has awsome acceleration when needed. For a convertible it does not have much road noise compared to other hard top cars and trucks i have owned. Very solid builtbuilt with great entertainment features like ford sync and the interchangeable underglow coloring lights under the dash and the instrument panel.  Surprisingly larger trunk space than expected with a convertible. Only complaint i have with the entire car is the non rear seat space. Also got the car used with 32k miles but its covered still under ford warrenty plus the tyotoa delearship i purchased it at gave me an unlimited mile engine power train warrenty for life at no cost.
time for a new one  I now have 42000 on my 06 azera and am going to get a 09 I was going to trade it in but the value is terrible I do not understand this car had 2 problems a broken head rest clip and a seat switch they really should value this car more they have made a lifetime Hyundai buyer out of me I plan On keeping my 06 and letting my daughter use it why should i give up the 100000 Great car keep up the good work 
"2006 Azera Ltd... we like it!  Fast, fun to drive. Excellent build quality and a lot of room both in the rear seat and the trunk! Gas mileage is not good enough in today's market. I get about 21 city and about 25 highway. I have also had some electrical issues with seat belt light coming on and headlights flickering. Overall a great car for the money."
"Doubting Hyundai buyer  When you turn your car on, does your car turn you on? Mine does! The only problem I had was the position the highlights were reflecting on the road, but the dealership adjusted. This car is wonderful. From the sleek exterior design, the plush interior to the horse power under the hood. My husband forced me to test drive a Sonata, but when we went into the dealership and I saw this Azera I knew it was something special. Like other comments I've read, it's hard to believe there aren't more on the road."
"Excellent vehicle  This is an excellent car that rides beautifully and gets decent gas mileage (avg. 26mpg) on the highway.  On the streets of NYC, the mileage plummets and is very poor. The on board computer lists the average mileage in the city as 12mpg.  The car is comfortable and performs well.  At the parking garage it has been mistaken for a Mercedes more than once.   "
"From a Lexus to an Azera  I was very shocked when i got into the 2006 Limited SE Azera especially since I had a 1992 Lexus LS400. The amenities are great and the car handles fine. The gas mileage definitely needs improvement. I love all the bells and whistles, like when a large SUV gets behind me at night. The lights used to shine right in my eyes. Now I just hit the back reflector shade and the night time driving button on the rear view mirror. I drove up to NY from Fla in 19 hours averaged 68 mph and averaged 28 mpg. I recommend the car. Watch out for the maintenance prices to keep the warranty valid thought. "
"AWESOME AZERA  I purchased this car in late 2006 & have been amazed at it's build quality & comfort. The driving position is perfect for a 6 footer. I use it daily for work in heavy Washington D.C. traffic & 54,000 miles have proven it's durability. It's a pleasure to drive.The Azera has features that others in it's class can't match.I get about 22 m.p.g. in the city, & 26-30 on the highway & this car is fast."
"A lot of car for the price I paid.  Nobody thought I'd buy this car, including me, but I haven't regretted since.  A lot of power for its curb weight.  The other day, I had no problem keeping up with a Mazdaspeed 3 on the freeway going 90mph.  Like some people say, you don't realize how fast you are going because the ride is very quiet and smooth.  Of course, it also helps that Hyundai has such long warranties on it.  Haven't had need to take it back to dealer yet though.  Roomy interior and superb upholstery, though not leather, all the nice touches are there including the ""fake"" wood plastic finish.  Large trunk. Exterior styling is ok, but not the best.  But for a $23K car, it's not bad.  "
"Great car!  We have been driving 06 Azera for about a year and half and have been extremely pleased with the quality of ride. So impressed were we that when we wanted to buy an SUV (had a baby) we immediately bought a Veracruz LTD AWD. This car has more features, bells and whistles than other brands for a far lesser price. We strongly recommend Azera for anyone looking for a mid-full size sedan. "
"3rd gear ???  At nearly 50,000 miles, I can give a fair evaluation. My Azera has snappy acceleration that requires you to pay attention. The pro review that said they got 17.7 mpg is way off base. He must have done his review driving around in 3rd gear. I get 26 to 28 mpg combined mileage, about half city and highway. I am an All-American, but I love just about everything about this car. Easy on tires? I am just about to buy the first set of replacement tires, going to get 235's this time; it will be even better. This car will not disappoint someone who wants a very smooth ride. It's quick, very comfortable with a big trunk for all my things, and a ton of very usable features...Ed"
A cheap Lexus!  I have had this car for over 2 years now and am still impressed. I am also surprised that I see so many Sonatas on the road and so few of these! I was afraid to gamble on Hyundai after a bad experience in the early 90's but the warranty sold me. The first year warranty seems to replace ANYTHING (I didn't need to use it) and the roadside assistance package can't be beat. This car has a nice but a bit conservative look. The led tail lights make things stand out some. This car has a lot of power and it is easy to be going close to 100 without even feeling it. The car does have a little soft ride and corners a little sloppy for my taste but it is an impressive car overall.
Awesome Muscle Car!  
"A fond farewell to my Azzie!  With a bad hip from my 1st. sedan in a very long time, I'm getting back to a small SUV, with more of a straight-up sitting position, the 4-cyl. H-Tuscon will prolly be my next vehicle. With average 24 mpg on my Azzie, I can't complain at all.  This was my first luxury sports sedan, driving ~2500 miles monthly for a supermarket chain, all over 5 counties in Tampa bay area.  The overall comfort, power to pass/merge, and styling are it's strong points, not to mention pricing when comparing other imported large sedans.  Got a sit-in recently in their new Genesis, very nice.  But on this even larger car, they don't offer the power folding mirrors, my favorite cool-gizmo!  "
"Avid Over Azera  I was very skeptical about buying a luxury Hyundai, but Azera has surpassed all of my expectations. The ride is powerful, sporty and yet comfortable. The seats are amazingly comfortable and memory seats make it easy to switch drivers. Fuel economy is very good for a large car: 22-24 city, 27-29 highway. Service has been excellent so far. We compared ride to Avalon and found this less floating and more sporty. You feel like you have a fast car, but very good at holding road and over bumps. Great car- big surprise."
"His Seat Don't  Fit  I bought this car and I love most everything about it, but I have a problem. My husband hates my drivers seat, he can not get it to go back far enough. I took it to the dealer, two times and they say  its just the way it is, but after reading all the reviews, no one has complained about the seat, so that tells me, my dealer just blew me off or my husband is the only man who can't fit behind the wheel. I like this car and most everything about it, but I don't want to do all the driving, when we go on a trip.   Can someone help?"
"Looking at another Hyundai  I can't count the number of time I'm asked about the Azera Limited by strangers. In parking lots, gas stations stop signs just everywhere. The last one was at a gas station. The guy even asked to sit it in. Beautiful was his comment! Couldn't believe it was 2 years old. Loved the whole car and was going to visit a dealer soon.   I love the features inside, attention to detail is equal to those other high-end cars. Power when you need to pass. My son played with the auto shift. Cool he said! Nice wide stance, if looking for a sporty ride not this car, it's a comfort car. Keep it maintained properly and it will go way beyond 10 yrs/100,000 miles.  "
"45,500 Miles Not A Problem  The Hankook tires will just about make my next 5,000 miles which will be my first big investment in this car- new tires at 50K miles. Rain, sleet, snow and clear skies, the car handles well and is comfortable for both front and rear passengers. I've had the dealer just perform oil changes (wiper blades at 40K)and rotated the tires. No other maintenance required. The body finish has held up well and the car looks brand new coming out of the car wash. Everyone who gets in can't believe how comfortable it rides, quiet and roomy. Overall this has been one of the best cars I have bought."
"After 3 new Hyundais..This is my last  Windows go down instead of up... Dealer can't duplicate. Trip odometer resets itself. Dealer can't duplicate. Radio has no volume. Dealer can't duplicate. Mirrors self adjust. Dealer can't duplicate. Hood latch doesn't work. Dealer says you have to play with it. Air intake for electrical component cooling in rear wheel well... 5 miles on a dirt road clogs filter... Dealer says car not meant to be driven on dirt road. Tsb on rear sunshade says replace known defective gear... Dealer says not covered under warranty. Lack of concern by Hyundai consumer affairs. 100,000 miles on santafe... No problems 50,000 miles on elantra... No problems 70,000 miles on azera... Nothing but problems."
"dont buy if you have an Acura    I traded out of my Acura due to gas prices, on the rise, as it took premium and it was getting up in miles 94,000 but should have kept the Acura, as I miss the handling on the Acura.  The Azera limited  handling is unstable,and bouncy. I cannot do 120 mph comfortably, as it does not handle the curves very well.  transmission has difficulty shifting at times,  ABS does not work well in the snow,  I slid a lot with new tires.  I get 15 mpg due to my driving habits, and  any one who knows how to drive, and likes to drive, will not like this car.   "
"TWO YEARS AND STLL LOVING IT  While the exterior style is nothing to boast about, the cabin is functional, fun, and fancy. People are surprised by the roominess and style of the car.  The car has held up well in both city and highway use.  "
"Azera 2006  This car that I now drive is one of the best cars that in over 55 years I have owned. Most every manufacturers top of the line automobile ( the automatic truck opener) that needed a visit to the dealer near my home has been the only time I needed to visit the dealer. On the highway, real good gasoline mileage and just average in city driving in the winter when we are visited by loads of heavy traffic from the snowbirds. I use only Mobil one oil and have never added a drop of oil between oil changes. My car being one of the first of this model did not come with a navigation system, but has every other item one could ask for."
Goes Like Stink  We bought our Azera new two years ago because an Azera passed our Mazda going up a steep hill. We weren't used to that. Can't understand anyone who says this car doesn't go like stink.  There were two models available and we got the one with the V6 3.8 engine (the cheaper model had a different motor -- the overview doesn't mention that so maybe a Canadian option) and all the bells and whistles. The ONLY vehicle that comes close is the Passat and we leave it behind on hills. The passing performance is simply spectacular which we need because we pass a lot of big trucks on icy roads.  Fabulous car. More for comfort than performance? I think not.
"gotta have it green retirement dream car  I have always been a mustang lover since I owned a 69 mach1 when I was 17.  I was looking for a perfect vehicle for my retirement, and so I bought a 2014 mustang with the 3.7L v6 and am so happy with it. It gives me the performance when I need it and the fuel economy when I don't. I am getting an average of 26 mpg to and from work.  I get so many people looking at my car with the ""gotta have it green"". I know they are green with envy. Keep up the great work Ford."
"Azzy Rules  Traded from a Buick Rendezvous because driving it 80 miles round trip to work was too much $$$ for gas. While looking at Sonatas, a salesman said ""check out the Azera, it has as much space as a 7 Series BMW"" I sat in it and was instantly hooked.  Bought my Azera used with 18K miles, I'm up to 45K and loving every driving minute. I get 29-33 MPG highway and 20-24 city. Idling will drive that down.  With the possible exception of my 96 Buick Riviera, it's the best ride I've ever had."
"Great Car  Excellent car, my 3rd Hyundai, love the power and gas mileage.  22 MPG around town, 29 MPG highway.  Great leg room, five adults can ride comfortably.  Holds the road well and has excellent power. Better insulation would help with road noise."
"Better than expected  Had 13,000 when purchased. Complained about possible suspension issues, Hyundai replaced all 4 struts and shocks. Had some minor problems that were taken care of under warranty. Mileage has been very good, well over 25 mpg. Had a Toyota Avalon and Mercedes e class, but this is much better car for the money. I am 6,4, but have plenty of room. I get a lot of ""what kind of car is this"", it looks great. Will be anxious to see the new Genesis. "
"Hope they can fix or won't buy another.  Impressed by the fit, finish, and options for the money. Didn't like the way the transmission shifted from day one. Under light throttle at 20-30 mph it can't seem to decide what gear it should be in. Also, torque converter lock up frequently won't release under load on a grade without first forcing a 5-4 downshift. More recently, I have been experiencing an intermittent but pronounced bucking/jerking under light load at 25-40 mph. It appears to be related to torque converter lock up problems. Engine is noisy (probably piston slap) until fully warmed up. Suspension transmits a lot of noise over rapid bumps such as rail road tracks or rough pavement. Tire noise is apparent on smooth roads."
"Had enough of it  Like other reviewers have said, all I ever hear from the service dept. is ""that is normal"".  The transmission in this car is terrible.  It never knows what gear to be in.  It has slipped on many occasions especially after getting off a highway onto city streets.  The service dept. even told me that if my wife drives different than me than the car will not learn how to shift properly!! Who would make a car like that?  My wife will not even drive it any more, she hates the transmission that much.  Too bad because most everything else is good.  Getting rid of it soon."
"I have 2 2006 Azera Limiteds  I bought my first 2006 Azera Limited brand new in November, 2006.  My parents bought a used 2006 Azera Limited in Spring, 2007.  I bought another used 2006 Azera Limited with 14,000 miles in February, 2007.  I have owned 3 Cadillac DeVilles and 2 Cadillac Sevilles since 1995. Although the Azera does not have the Cadillac ride, I still like it better than the Cadillacs.  The gas mileage in town has been around 17 but on the road I get mid 20s.  Obviously, I am sold on the Azera Limited.  I hope the resale values are better in a few years. I look forward to the introduction of the Genesis this summer.     "
"Azera Problems  Gas mileage less than 12 mpg city; told car should have at least 10K   miles before you get good mileage. Had car in 3 times; told everything normal, ""that's what you should expect"". Combined city/highway only 17 with >50% expressway. Minor items: accelerator very sensitive on starting; doesn't shift to highest gear til 40 mpg (told normal); keys bump against steering column; no coin holder for tolls, parking meters; light beige interior shows dirt readily."
"Luv it  I love my Azera since I have had it, it has been great. We drive out of town a lot and it drives like a high priced car. It is fun to drive and is one of the safest in its class. I is very fast, handles great, rides smooth, and we love it.  "
Dead Battery  Gas mileage is terrible. No front seat drivers side leg room. Not a car to drive if you are over six feet tall. Battery drains after 3-4 days of being parked. Hyundai says that is normal(?) Transmission never knows what gear it wants to be in. No reason to buy this car as long as they are building Accords and Camrys.
"Why drive anything else?  I've owned many different cars in the last 32 years - all European, and I've kept an eye on the market. The Azera is, in my opinion, the best luxury car you can get for the money. To get a comparably equipped car from anyone else, you'd have to spend at least $5k more, and you probably still wouldn't have rain-sensing wipers. The Azera is very quick, handles well, and has clean, distinctive, styling. And don't forget the LED tail lights, as they afford those behind you an extra margin when you're stopping. Though city economy is not great, I've consistently acheived 28+ MPG on the highway. I just don't see how you could go wrong. This is the frugal buyers luxury car!"
"Black and Gold  First new car I ever bought for myself, V6 Premium with Pony & Comfort Package, Black with dealer furnished Gold Le Mans stripes. Constantly getting comments from people that think it's a V8. I've owned a bunch of 1st Generation Mustangs, including a 68 GT/CS, & 3 - 70 Mach 1's. This isn't fastest Mustang I've ever owned, but definitely my favorite. It's my daily driver and I've put over 32,000 miles on it already. I took it from San Antonio, TX to Sturgis, SD for the 8th annual Mustang Rally, even there among so many great Mustangs I got a few compliments. My V6 automatic would not have a problem beating a stock mid 60's 289 or 302 2bbl., but I didn't get even close to 30+ MPG Highway and they were lighter weight than current 5th Gen. Mustangs."
"2006 Hyundai Azera  I work at an auction yard, and drive all makes and models of cars, and the only car that can match the Azera is the BMW, but it costs to much money."
"Most Bang for the Buck  I have driven this car for about 14 months now and have no complaints or gripes. and it is $4000.00 cheaper than it's nearest competitor. I test drove all the vehicles in it's class,domestic and foreign, and found nothing better in that price range. In the categories listed above. I was a local car salesman so I have driven a lot of cars from Maserati's to Yugo's and I love this car. I have gotten out of a lot of tight scrapes and dangerous driving situations with this car,It saved my life in handling. This car does what Hyundai says it would. The advertisements don't lie. hmmm! a auto dealer than doesn't lie, a car commercial that tells the truth, amazing. Rick and Werner Eden"
"A Cheap BMW!  I have owned this car for over a year now and it has been worth every cent so far. I was scared to trust a Hyundai after my sisters experience with a Sonata back in the 90's but the warranty made me take the risk. This car has operated flawlessly since ownership. Like all cars, there are good and bad but this car has been a winner. I am a previous Dodge Intrepid owner and was impressed with the quality, performance and comfort. My only gripe with this car is the shadow that hangs over the driver side low beam headlight. I have heard others complain about this and am still searching for a fix. Other than that, avoiding tickets is my main concern with this cruiser."
"My Azera..  One problem, a ""dead battery"", @ 2,500 miles.They came out within 25 minutes to jump start.I took it to dealer, and they checked it out.Found no problem. I put it on a 24 hr charger, and have had no problems since! ( This happened January, 07) Bumpy ride over rough roads. Very Quiet interior, I sometimes try to start it after it's been running, due to no engine sounds inside the car. Overall, it's been the ""best car"", I've ever owned. Very spacious interior. (I also own a Lincoln, and a Corvette, also bought new.)"
"Impressive Hyundai  I've owned my Azera almost 9 months and have enjoyed every minute.  I was prepared to buy an '07 Sonata but after test driving some leftover '06 Azeras on the lot, I was hooked.  I ended up paying about $1200 more than I would have for a new Sonata and got a heck of a lot more car.  People can't believe it's a Hyundai.  It's not a tight ""sporty"" ride.  Handling is a bit drifty, but it's a bigger, softer car.  BUT, with 263 ponies under the hood, this car is NOT shy.  Styling is sharp and contemporary.  Not one ""cheap"" element to this vehicle.  I just don't understand why Hyundai has so heavily marketed the Sonata when this gem is out there.  Just test drive it!"
"Fast, but you pay for the power  We have put about 26K on our 2006 Azera SE.  Bought it for about 22K.  Lots of zip but overall gas mileage right about 21.5. Have had some issues with it (a/c compressor overvoltage, rear windows not going down, crack in dash) but dealer has been very good about fixes.  As with most dealers, service dept tries to make a lot of money.  Saying that I had to flush and fill transmission at 30K to keep warranty. 175 dollar deal.  Easy to change trans fluid yourself on this car. Finally pinned them down and flush/fill not required to meet warranty, just drain and refill.  Keep receipts for trans oil, of course and use special Hyundai oil like the book says. "
"Love the Azera  Due to illness I drive very little. But my experience with the Hyundai Azera has been just fabulous. I've owned Cadillacs, Mercedes, Volvo etc., but none as given me  more pleasure than this car."
"AWESOME  I bought this car in early 2006. Not really knowing what to expect, I was a bit shy about Hyundai's reputation previously, but was willing to take a chance. I am overwhelmed at it's performance & great looks. Well assembled, it will shame most cars on the road today. I prefer driving it over my Cadillac."
"Great Vehicle  Purchased used 2006 Azera Ltd. with 15,200 miles.  Tremendous car.  I miss the smoother ride of the XG350 I previously had, which was sacrificed in the Azera for better/sportier handling, however; I knew that when I purchased it.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the combination of handling, quiet ride (it's still very smooth) and performance/fuel efficiency from the 3.8 liter engine.  The interior features are all top notch with tons of space for comfort.  Six air bags and electronic stability control add some peace-of-mind safety features."
"Nice...but still need improvement...  I been drive azera for little over a year. very nice car for money, but still need improvement, such as performance, gas milage, interior lay out, etc. Before i buy this, i did alots research... azera is best car for 30k and under, but doesn't feel like or compare to lexus nor infinity. i'm happy with azera for now, but in future i may trade in with lexus GS... "
"Great Car!  My first Mustang was a 1984 GT.Wow, they sure have come a long way in 30 years.My '84 had 200-225 HP and a carburetor.This has a 6 cyl. automatic and 305 HP!While this won't rule the drag strip, it has plenty of power.Interior is equipped nicely and is very comfortable for my 5' 11"" frame.SYNC is handy, radio sounds nice, auto up and down windows are cool.Reaching behind me for the seat belt would be my only complaint.Leather wrapped steering wheel is very comfortable.Switching from comfort, standard and sport steering is a nice touch. Sport gives you a great feel for the road. The optional thumb shifter for sport I find unnecessary, but time will tell.I have owned the car for 2 years now, and all I can say is WOW!This has been one of the most reliable cars I have ever owned and still performs beyond my expectations.It turns heads wherever I go and am getting compliments continuously on the ruby red clear coat paint.Took a 500 mile road trip and was impressed by the comfort over my other cars (mostly SUVs)."
"You'll be pleasantly suprised  After over 230,000 miles on my Toyota Camry LE wagon, I began looking for a replacement that would not only be as reliable as the Toyota, but also well- made and safe.  I looked at several comparable vehicles and consulted many consumer resources (kbb, edmunds, JD Powers, Consumer Reports, etc.), and chose the Azera as the best value overall.  I have the Limited Edition pearl white exterior with the light gray interior, leather seats, beautiful wood trim, sun roof, rear sun shade, with dual climate control.  The ride is very comfortable and quiet, with minimal wind/road noise.  The fit and finish is comparable to models with higher price tags.  People have asked what import model I drive! :-)"
"won't start  I was very pleased with this car at first. After 4 months, all of a sudden the car wouldn't start. The A/C also wasn't working right. The dealer kept it a week . They replaced a switch for the a/c & another switch for the neutral disable . Well, about a month later, it's not starting again. I'm very discouraged."
The Azera Experience  I had never heard of this car but drove by a dealership and saw it sitting in the lot and I loved the sleek design and styling.  I stopped to look and at first thought this is way too expensive for me.  I loved it from the minute I sat in the very comfy leather seat.  The best thing about it to me are all the features and how comfortable the seats are and the smooth ride.  I am a new owner and hope that my experience with my Azera is an enjoyable one.
Poor company response to safety defect  The head lights are of poor design and make driving the car unsafe at night. I drive emergancy vehicles and have been trained for over 26 years. This car makes it so you over drive your headlights at night and is unsafe. The company response to the problem is very poor and not owner friendly. They do not seen to care about the safety of their buyers.
Exactly as Expected...  I bought this car for my father to replace his ageing '99 BMW 540i. He seemed skeptical in the beginning but within a week he was in love with the Azera. I did my research beforehand on it's competitors and am pleased with my decision
Clean Ride  Compare
"Best car I've owned  Sad that Hyundai USA will not be importing the Azera anymore. Best car I've owned. Perfect for long trips, cruising. Beautiful styling, looks. Comfortable yet not soft. Powerful yet refined. Need I add I'm sad?"
"Great Car  This is the best car in the market for price, comfort and safety features. By far the best car I've ever owned for the money.....Sorry to hear Azera is being discontinued for 2018."
"Hyundai has a Luxury Sedan, WHAT?!  Yes, This is a luxury sedan in every way.  It's outward appearance wants to be a sports sedan, but it is not.  With that being said Pros: Good Gas mileage on regular gas, cup holders are located perfectly, LARGE truck, dual zone HVAC, Heated and cooled front seats, Heated back seats, ONLY CAR (not minivan) I know that has an electronic rear window shade and manual passenger window shades(my kids LOVE them), tilting side mirrors in reverse, steering is fluid and great turning radius giving you the sense you are dirivng a lighter and smaller car.  CONS: not a sports sedan!, steering is fluid and has a little over steer especially at high speeds, window controls on driver side are too far back(I need to push my elbow into my gut to get the rear windows down), sunroof is complicated to work. Even with the 19"" wheels it rides well, at 6' tall I can sit in the back seat comfortably,  cool interior lighting at night.  It sucks that I don't love the outside as I wanted a sports sedan (last car was an infiniti q40) - but I do really like this car. The technology package is a real bonus, but I did buy the extended warranty."
Not an Avalon  
"2014 Black on Black   This is my favorite Ford car yet. I got a great deal on it and used the savings to add fog lights, black wheels, and quarter-window louvers. Even with the V6 and 2.73 rear end, the acceleration is unbelievable. It is not real fast until it hits high rpm's, so off the line it is not winning any races, but soon afterwards it will throw you back in your seat. The select shift is useless unless you shift at higher rpm's. In the low rpm range (under 2000), it will say you shifted on the dash, but it is lying. I love the layout of everything, especially the dash. The overall interior and exterior are beautiful, even in the base trim. As for mpg's, I averaged 29.8 in the first 6 months."
"Excellent choice...  Previously had a 2009 Genesis 4.6 - great car but rear wheel drive was a problem for Indiana winters.  After four years, switch to another brand auto, but neither the car or the service was what I had with Hyundai.
The Azera is the only front-wheel drive from Hyundai that is in this class.  Extremely comfortable, fun to drive, great features, and extremely good value.
This is our fourth Hyundai, and their customer service is equal to or better that what I experienced with my three BMWs, one Infiniti, and one Acura - I have absolutely no reason to go to another brand."
Azera junk!  I sent a review the other day and I have since heard from Hyundai customer service. Nothing has changed. They still sell junk and call it quality. The selling dealer is no better. I will not buy another or even keep this one. Bad tires ( Michelin ) terrible ride. Road noise is terrible. Don`t forget you do not need Miller Hyundai in vestal New York. And you do not need a Hyundai from anywhere. 
Michelin tires  The tires on this car are very noisy. The car rides very roughly. Next time maybe try a sonata.
"Looks Great, But.....  This is a great looking car. Performance is very adequate. However, the ride is horrible. I don't know why some peeps find the ride so good. Mine is like a buckboard. The rear suspension is so rough till I cringe every time I hit any bump. This car feels EVERY expansion joint on an Interstate. I don't know if I'd buy another one at this point. It would have to be a vast improvement, otherwise I'll stick to my wonderful and dependable Toyotas."
"This car can't be under $28000.00  Had this car for past 4 month. and the car drives like it my wife's LS430. I love the handling and ride quality. But best thing about this car is it only cost  me 1/2 of my wife's car. PRICE! It's like Korean, it takes over every thing. TV,DVD,washer, almost every thing at our house is Korean company (Samsung or LG).  Bottom line is Hyundai finally got it right and I""m sold."
"Real value  Bought the black on black.  Looks very good inside and out.  Drives like a very high-end luxury car.  I am very satisfied with my purchase at less than $26,000.  Unfortunately, I already got two small scratches down to the metal.  I don't know if it's the paint quality or just fate.  Seats are very plush at first, but I found I needed to shift my weight around after about an hour of driving to be comfortable.  I don't recall doing this in other cars."
From Mercedes to Hyundai  I have owned a Jaguar a Benz and a Lincoln. I love my Hyundai. For and entry level luxury sedan it's well worth it. I bought it used with 33k on it. Now have 40k and it feels fine. Runs strong fast comfortable just and all around great car. Haven't had the rough idle and plan to keep maintain
One of the worst car that I have ever bought  Warning Do not buy Hyundai Azera. It has engine problem the stupid 10 years warrenty is worthless. I own a 2012 Hyundai Azera it has engine problem I took it to the dealer several times for the same issues. The problem with the car is that it’s shaking it vibrates they call it rough idle when it’s turn it on when you drive it you feel it less but when you stop at a light or park it while the car is still on the entire car is shaking. Long story short they put a brand new engine in my car guess what? I still have the same exact issue with the car. At the end the corporate said there is nothing els they can do.
Hyundai Azera  I really enjoy driving this Hyundai Azera. I have had it for a year and a half  without any problems. I am looking for comfort and reliability and my Hyundai Azera has it. I drove my Azera to the state of Washington and back. It was an enjoyable trip. I really love this car and would definitely buy another one.
"Style, Comfort, Reliability  5+ years, 50K miles. Still runs great, rides comfortably, and very low maintenance. Main issue after 5 years of ownership - the technology changes that have occurred in the auto industry since 2012 are significant.....This will make someone a great used car when I trade up."
"Not bad   I just got a 2014 mustang it's my first brand new car as I'm only 17. I love it. It drives well and handles great. Not to amazed by the interior. Looks cheap. Also had a squealing noise in the the transmission well I think that's where it's coming from. It gets louder in reverse and drive. But over all I love the car. Not to happy about the stock wheels Ford hands out the car. I know it's a base v6 but cmon it's a mustang. I'm purchasing new wheels for it soon anyway. It's an automatic, there was no choice for automatc v6. "
"2012 Hyundai Azera  I bought this used 2012 Azera just a week ago. I have only had this car a week and I absolutely love it. I am probably driving my friends crazy with that look at my new toy, look at it, lets drive somewhere attitude. Before the Azera I owned a 2005 Hyundai Sonata GLS which I bought in 2006. I loved that car and did my best to give it the TLC a car needs and it has lasted and lasted and still turned heads. But I was more than ready for a newer car with updated amenities and the 2012-2014 Azera model Really captured me. Also I never see this model and trim on the road which made me want it all the more. This car is simply gorgeous in every way its Pearl white with the black glass top and 19 inch wheels and a camel leather interior. I love the lines, the curves and the sharpness of the interior and exterior. I am over the moon with this one. Its super comfortable and very roomy. I'm 6'2"" as I sit in the driver seat I then get out and sit  in the back seat to see how another tall person would feel, it sit has ample leg room. I love everything about my 2012 Hyundai Azera Special Edition. My only complaint is the GPS/voice command isn't very user friendly, but perhaps I'm just not doing something right, I have only had it for a week."
"Love the car - but......  Everything everyone else writes is correct and I don't have any complaints about this car except....
 There will be times when I put the car in drive or reverse and all of a sudden it gives a VIOLENT jolt as if you were just hit by another car. Its rather scary. 
 I found where a few others have posted online about this but unable to figure out the problem. The also gave me a  loaner and it also did the JOLT. 
 Please comment if you have experienced this in your car, once or more. 
 I took the car into the dealership and they have been unable to trace the cause of the problem, and Hyuandai also shows nothing in their records of this problem. TRUST ME, it exists - "
"We could not be more happy with our choice  We have been thoroughly please with our Azera.I have not had a car that I love to drive like this one.We love just going for rides.This thing is fast!! and if we want to take it easy on freeway on 300 mile trips we get 30 to 32 mpg.Our overall average is 22 with city, freeway, going easy and punching for fun moments.Seats are way way comfortable.My wife loves how the passenger seats automatically adjusts to any height or position she wants.I am 6' 3"" and she is 5' 4"".our other car when she is in passenger seat sits way below me.Like below I could go on.We simply could not be more pleased."
"This car will convert Hyundai snobs!  I just turned 5,000 miles on my new 2012 Azera and I love it more every day!This is the best entry level luxury car there is.The body design, coupled with the lighting screams nothing but class.Premium comfort comes from within on this car.The controls are laid out very well, and the all around the cabin accent lighting in a nice touch.Plush seating is very important to me and this ride has it in spades.Being that you can get all that for well under $40k, it is an unbelievable buy!Lastly, on a trip from Virginia to Texas using only interstate highways, I averaged 33 mpg!"
Can't beat the value for the price!  Impressive roominess in the cabin with far better seats then the over price would suggest. Nice comfortable ride with MPGs to spare.
"Did I really just buy an Azera? It's the 8th wonder of the world!  First off we have found ourselves only buying German cars as far back as I can remember. I bought 3 new Mercedes and 2 new BMWs and really was a bit of a snob when it came to the Hyundai brand. I told my friends my criteria for the new car that I wanted to buy and they told me I HAD to at least test drive the Azera. It came down to another 3 series, the new Lexus ES350, the Maxima, a Ford Taurus and a comparably equipped Buick. Hyundai was my last test drive and I knew it was the car for me and bought it on the spot. The tech in this car is nothing short of amazing and I felt so responsible for the first time after buying a car."
"2012 Azera with Tech  It has been a week since i picked up the new Azera and so far it has been a pleasant experience. I have only purchased Japanese premium brands until now. I was looking for a large sedan or a CUV (I have a two year old boy) for greater space for the family. I looked into Avalon, Edge, Explorer, Venza, etc but none of these cars could even come close to matching the amenities and the build quality that of the new Azera. I have to give it to the hyundai for vastly improving and becoming one of the market leaders in many areas including build quality, warranty, reliability, etc. Overall I am quite satisified with the purchase."
"Highly recommend this car  I have never owned a car as wonderful as this one, and I have had over 50 cars in my lifetime.  Even better than a Lexus I had a a few years ago.  The things I like the best are the side monitoring system (its way above average), the backup camera, the comfortable seats (with heat and air conditioning), and the sound system.  The technology is so easy to use especially the GPS.  Really, there is not 1 single thing I would change about this car.  It rides like a big car and handles like a sports car.  And the gas mileage has been in the 30+ range."
"2016 discount dreamboat  Actually just picked this thing up today and have to say when they put this together they really thought of everything and then some. The outside appearance of this car is very elegant with sexy slooping lines and accents in all the right places. The interior is well thought out and even without the limited you get a truckload of features that comparable cars dont unless u spend thousands more. And they've thought of nice small touches to make u notice how amazing it is. For instance when you put the car in park at night the floorboards illuminate so you can see things.the infinity sound system is nothing short of amazing  and is very crisp, capturing everything. The motor is slightly underpowered for the car but definetly provides adequate pickup while the transmission provides smooth shifts. So far we've averaged 23.5 mpgs average with both hwy and city driving and being able to whisper to each other at highway speeds. To add to it handling is everything you'd expect from a premium sedan and you can literally turn the wheel of the car with your pinky sitting still... so not for handling junkies but for those that want to enjoy the ride. Backseat room and comfort i feel is 2nd to none. There is so much room back there we had no 2nd thoughts aboht trading our 2017 Traverse on this. Plus the trunk is HUGE so llenty of room for storage. Great job hyundai and bring this baby back with unparalleled marketing to make it sell!!! Why u got rid of it i dont know... but most wont know what it is unless u explain it so market the crap out of it and bring it back (with an AWD 2.0T)."
"Overlooked Mini Genesis  Great car, but right in the gap between Sonata and Genesis. I am now on my 3rd Genesis, a 2017 G80 Tech 6cyl; the past 2 were 8's. We just bought a 2016 Azera Ltd to replace my Wife's 2012 Sonata. The Azera has almost all the features of my G80, and few I don't have. If you are looking, and would love to have a front wheel drive car, but like the Genesis, look at the 16+ Azera Ltd"
Friends don't let Friends buy a Ford  Just purchased a new Mustang and already back for repairs. Needs New lower control arms and bushings. Noises coming from drive tran. Missing pieces that were left off.  Costly junk..I ll never buy Ford again.. Corporate office of Ford is rude and could care less if they made junk. Local dealer not much better.   
"1 Year with My 2016 Azera  I'm now one year in with my 2016 Hyundai Azera Limited and I still love it!  This a fantastic luxury automobile without the luxury price tag.  Like others have stated, I don't know why Hyundai has not talked about this car.  I've never seen an ad for one and actually discoverd the Azera when I visited a Hyundai dealer a year ago to look at a Genesis.  The salesperson recommended the Azera because I could get all of the Genesis luxury features at a significantly lower price point.  Of course now that Hyundai is launching it's luxury Genesis brand seperate from Hyundai they are not bringing the Azera back for 2018.  This decision allowed me to buy my Azera at a deep discount which was a win for me.  This car has everything you could ever want in a luxury sedan and it's beautiful inside and out with sleek styling and a very well thought out cabin of comfort and conveniences.  Living in hot Texas, I love my ventilated seats and automatic sun shade for the rear window.  I don't think I can ever drive another vehicle that doesn't offer ventilated seats!  My only gripe with this car was the oversensativity of the lane departure warning system.  Luckily, the car gives you option to deactivate lane departure warning which I did.  I might've liked that feature more if it actually corrected the stearing rather than just beeping at you.  Blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic control with the backup camera are terrific features.  I would also have preferred the front seat adjustments to be placed on the side of the seats as in most cars rather than on the doors and slightly difficult to reach and adjust while also sitting back at the same time.  You won't find a better luxury car in the price point."
"Never before, have I had such an incredible car.  Geez, where to begin on this car?  Everything I have ever wanted in a car.  The Limited model is truly a luxury car.  I mean the outside is just plain oozing with style.  It is gorgeous and makes a statement, and definitely makes an impression on the road and in parking lots.....it is just such a ""sleek"" design.  The interior - reminds me of high-end BMW's and other cars with the ambient lighting across the doors and the dashboard (I didn't know it had the interior ambient lighting until later that night after I drove it off the lot.......I already was impressed with the car then I saw that added little thing - it just further blew me away.    I swear - I am finding new things on this car every day - until recently I didn't realize the car has a ventilated glove box!!  I was like what??  The car drives and handles like a dream - the technology is outstanding, the way the interior is made is so sleek and gorgeous - again ""oozes"" with style.  Honestly - I have had my share of ""lemons"" and other cars in the past....I have owned sedans, SUVs, and trucks, and the Hyundai Azera stands out by far from all the rest.  I mean it when I say it has EVERYTHING.  I love the detectors (blind spot, collision, rear cross-traffic alert, a huge screen for the backup camera) - I love how the car is just ""smart"" and is truly, such a pleasure to drive.  Why Hyundai doesn't advertise this dream car is beyond my understanding - I live in a big city and I think I have seen maybe 2 or 3 other Azeras on the road in the last 10 months I have owned the car.  If you are considering this automobile - DO IT.  Just do it - you will NOT be disappointed.  Way nicer and full of amenities than a base model Genesis, and way more value and is just better in my opinion than competitors like the Nissan Maxima or the Toyota Avalon.  Did I mention the huge panoramic glass roof?  It is a dream on wheels - I will not be trading in anytime soon - again - the Azera is everything I have ever wanted in a car, have gotten NUMEROUS compliments from people on it, it will NOT disappoint.***Update as of May 2018 - still own it - still love it - still think it’s the best car I’ve ever owned."
"Outstanding Car  We've had the car nine months and we both like this car very much of different reasons. She's 5'2"" I'm 6'2"" and finding a good driving position is not a problem even before getting in as the switch is right on the door as you open it. Once started it is very quiet, so quite at times I'm not sure it's running without checking the tachometer. Before we leased we went to several dealers checking out the larger Buick, Toyota, BMW and Lexus, Toyota was the closes but ended up being about $3000 more. After driving all and keeping them for three days or so we both decided on the Azera Limited and we're very happy we did. Yep some of the other claim to get better gas mileage but have found Hyundai was quite honest on the mileage. Most reviews say 19 in town, we see 21. Not sure what anyone would want on a car that isn't there. For me that extra would be the sun shade for the back window, didn't think I'd ever use it but I pick up kids from school so I sit and wait. Our former car had black inside like this one and with that shade it's cooler inside. The back door windows have manual shades and the back is power, kinda wish the doors were the same. Everything on this car has been problem free and when the least is up unless major problems arise we will buy.                     Now for things that are odd. Control for seat is an odd place for someone with short arms, on the upper area of the door but you get use to that. Not crazy about the tires that came on it, tracking it not true so these tires will be changed, likely Pirelli. Two USB ports would be nice in the front, a better range of air flow from the center stack."
New Car  Traded in 2013 Santa Fe Sport base model. Wanted something nice but also with a little more power. Drove the Chrysler 300 and Dodge Charger and the Impala. The Azera beats them all on value. You get a fully loaded car for the same price as their base models. I love this car and recommend to anyone looking for a full size sedan that is also a luxury sedan
"The 2016 is even better...  We had a 2014 Azera(base model) and were quite pleased with the car...but there were a few features that were not on that vehicle - mostly safety related - that I would like to have.  We found a 2016 Limited with everything that we wanted.  The driver's information and NAV systems have been significantly upgraded.  Safety features like blind spot, rear parking sensors, and adaptive cruise control are a real plus.  The 2014 is a good car, but we like the updates and the upgrade to the 2016 Limited model...well worth the value to us."
Good alternative to the new Genesis  This new model came with all the technology features I was looking for in a slightly upscale sedan.
"Our 3rd Hyundai  We have owned a 2007 Santa Fe Limited and a 2011 Hyundai Azera Limited (both ourchased new)  previous to purchasing our new 2016 Hyundai Azera Limited.  We have never had a problem with either of our previous Hyundais.  Very low maintainence (Oil and filter on a regular basis) and superb reliablity.  Comfort and high mpg on long trips (4000 miles or more) was a plus.  They are a great value compared to automobiles in the same class.  The Azera Limited comes with everything.  You do not have to go through a pick and choose with options.  They are already there and part of the total price.  This is a comfotable sedan with plenty of room and beautiful styling.  As for our dealers, couldn't ask for anything better."
"comfort & safety  The car is comfortable, very roomy. The technology & electronic features are over whelming..Not easy to set up."
"You Bought a What?  I have owned many of the upscale brands including Mercedes to Lexus. I am very pleasantly surprised at how the Azera stands up to the higher-priced spread in comparison. The exterior style isn't necessarily a show-stopper but my black and tan Limited with 19 inch wheels stills looks pretty cool coming down the street. The interior is top quality with heated, perforated leather seating, a great sound system and plenty of room -- front and back. The 293 hp engine has plenty of acceleration and gets up to cruising speed on the highway very quickly and smoothly. And a big, big plus is high 20's mileage with regular gas. I considered a pre-owned 5-series Beemer but am very happy that I chose the Azera. This car has all the bells and whistles for under $40K... hard not to give it a chance."
"A Shockingly Luxurious Vehicle  You get a lot for your money buying Hyundai. The Azera is an excellent example.  The competition cannot come close to the size,  speed,  comfort or amenities of the Azera at the price or even at a higher price.  One thing to note is that the Infinity sound system is pretty good but lacks a bit on the high end,  thoughyou can make up for that using the equalizer.  The functions of the stereo are quite common sense and well laid out withactual buttons for many functions.  The competition seem to rely far too much on the touchscreen. I don't find that I have to use the touchscreen at all for most actions as real buttons handle most common tasks from running the climate control to changing the volume.  A lot of perks also exist,  such as the automatic headlights. Not only do you never have to turn your headlights on manually,  but even the brights are automatic.  If a car is approaching head-on the brights deactivate rather quickly and reactivate once the car has passed.  The timing of this feature is absolutely perfect.  You COULD also manually control the lights and bypass the automatic functions,  but the computer and sensors handle this so well that you won't mind relinquishing those tasks.  All of the tech is bypassable including the smooth and responsive automatic transmission. The option exists to use the stick shifter to change gears manually in a small mini gate to the left of the main automatic selection gate.  This can really make the large sedan feel sporty,  rocketing from zero to sixty in a respectable time under 7 seconds.  Of course,  one also has an economy mode.  I was able to squeak out 32 mpg highway and 28 mpg in-town while still driving a bit aggressively and fast. It will hold 80 mph at 2000 rpm,  so you have plenty of room to achieve higher speeds.  At 80, the fastest I went,  the sedan feels remarkably connected to the pavement while also somehow feeling a bit light.  It is like flying nore than driving given the smooth suspension.  But cornering ath higher speeds was nonetheless snappy and the body did not noticeably roll.  The wet road handling is OK,  though the wide tires feel uneasy in heavy rain and the wheel wells really fill up with an alarming effect if you hit a large puddle.  Still,  the car never hydroplanes,  the braking and suspension instead compensating well for the excess power that might otherwise be problematic in unfavorable elements.  It does indeed have that Asian import look (many are US built),  but the exterior style is well executed and modern.  Not a boring car to look at. Rather the playful fins sculpted into the rear harken back to the 1957 Chevy while the aggressive hood and fascia definately remind you that this vehicle exemplifies the future.  Somehow the sculpted wavy lines all work together to make for a sporty yet elegant body.  Vastly prettier tha an Audi or BMW,  and more exotic than a Mercedes or Cadillac,  the exterior will make the owner quite happy and satisfied. You don't seem to get used to looking at this car. It sticks out in a parking lot,  unapologetically shaming more expensive luxury sedans for being so boring."
One owner  I bought this car spankin new and i still am In love with this car.  This car hugs the road and does whatever you ask at a moments notice.   The only thing I have had to fix is the alternator.   Of course there are repairs like tires and brakes. This car has gone all these years and no mechanical breakdown!   How many cars can you say that about?This car is GREAT!
"One Super Car  Bought my 2006 GT with 5,000 miles on it and in absolute perfect condition. This car is a blast to customize and an absolute head turner.  "
"2014 Mustang GT/CS  I got a new 2014 Mustang GT/CS with the 6-speed manual transmission. The power of this car is amazing. I got the navigation package with the heated mirrors and pony lamps on it. If I keep my foot out of it, the gas mileage is not bad. I have been getting 23-24 in mixed driving and 25.5 when not having to run the AC.The car rides much better than expected. Driving it 4 hours for a trip to the beach was every bit as comfortable as riding in my wife's Honda Accord. I like the retro look of the 2014 better than the more modern look of the new 2015. Ford did a great job in the design of the 2014."
"In love with my Azara Experiance  I can't say enough about my over all satisfaction with the 2012 and now the 2016 Azara.  In 2012 I trade in my BMW 750L for the Azara, I was worried that I would be greatly disappointed but I wanted to save some money as I had to kids entering college.  I was worried about NOTHING; the Azara was such a plesant surprise, it is chuck full of high end technology, fantastic look and feel, an increadably comfortable ride.   With all honestly, I did not miss a single thing from my BMW.  The price value was amazing and the ownership experience was even more of a pleasure.  In fact I loved is so much I just picked up my new 2016 Azara Limited. I just know I'm going to love my 2016 even more then my 2012.   If you have not considered an Azara you are truly missing out!"
Classy Car  Great performance. Plenty of room for occupants to stretch legs.Smooth ride.Good value and looks and feels classy.
"Azera - Hyundai's Red Headed Step Child.  This is our 2nd Azera, replacing our 2012 Ltd. For some reason Hyundai does not advertise this car. In the 4 years of owning out first Azera, we only saw one TV ad for this car. I my opinion, this is the best car in it's price range - bar none.  The styling is great, quality is fantastic, great acceleration, the back seat is like a limo, and the value for the money is unbelievable. The only minor problems we have with the car is the stupid placement of the control for the power seats, up on the front part of the door instead of on the lower part of the seat bun where they belong, and the gas mileage. It get about 20 MPG around town and about 27 on the road.  I thought it would be better, but it does have 290 HP, so I may be dreaming expect more.  This car is best deal going too.  We got ours for almost $8K off list, which made it to good to pass up, but it was deal at list. If you are looking at something in the $35K range, check out the Azera - you won't believe the value."
Beautiful car  A great looking car and has a very smooth ride.
"Nice  Quiet, comfortable ride, loaded with useful features"
Faux Lexus  Had everything that the Lexus ES 350 except the nameplate and price.
"Got this used for almost half sticker price  I think I found a heck of a deal: 40k miles, 1.8 years old, half of original sticker price in really good condition. Car was a rental, everything works as it should, nothing broken. I traded my beemer because I was starting to get tired of fixing something small almost every other month. Now I should be good for a while. I like the engine and no joke, driving very conservative on Economy mode at ~60 on speedway I was reported into 35mpg by the computer - need to verify that at next refill! In city driving I got over 22mpg. The only thing I'm missing it is a moonroof; found one while shopping but it was 2 years older and more than 2K extra. I am not crazy about the Infinity sound in the high end, controls of the front seats and how the transmission downshifts when i brake. I think the Azera it is a hidden gem in the Hyundai line with luxury for the price of regular. Even my son will ask to get the Azera out for a walk every now and then... Happy Hyundai family here: I drive Azera, my wife a Sonata and my son a Genesis coupe 2.0, knock on wood no problems on any of them so far!"
"Awesome 2015 Limited Azera  This is my first Hyundai, and I had my doubts. But this has been, by far, the most pleasurable car that I have owned. I'm at the point in my life where I am looking for comfort over sharp driving characteristics, and this car has far exceeded my expectations. I know that it has received criticisms for steering and cornering, but honestly, I don't experience it as lacking in either. In fact, I find it quite sure footed in normal driving conditions. The navigation system has both pros and cons. It is a big step up in terms of clarity, but it is annoying that you have to type in a complete address. Even my old Prius had more intuitive software than this. But the whisper quiet ride and fantastic audio system more than make up for this shortfall. And the automatic high beams are a real plus in more rural driving conditions like we have in Arizona. Buy it and don't look back. It's been 9 months and still couldn't be happier with the car. Long trip which were excruciating in the Prius are pure pleasure in the Azera. Also, much better than expected mpgs on the highway. I average over 31 mpgs during long highway stretches. Truck is cavernous- again, making long road trips a pleasure."
"Not the luxury cruiser I hoped for  A number of things attracted me to the Azera. We own a CUV for basic transportation, I was looking for a luxury cruiser for extended trips. I was torn between a Chevrolet and the Hyundai. There aren't many cars in this price range that offer V-6 performance with front-wheel-drive. In the end I think I just preferred the looks and interior of the Hyundai over the competitor from General Motors.After owning the car for a little more than one year there are no surprises. Engine power combined with the auto/manual transmission produces the performance I was looking for. Gas mileage is right on with the manufacturers numbers. Highway mileage runs very close to 30 mpg seemingly regardless of speed. The seats are quite comfortable while traveling for long periods. They also are heated or cooled depending on preference.While I have been pleased with the car, I am disappointed with two things. The ride is severely hampered by the low-profile tires making the ride to harsh for the luxury vehicle class. Something I should've taken into consideration when comparing this vehicle with the competitor from GM. I've also noted excessive wear on the driver seat in the bolster area. It appears the ""imitation leather"" has worn off from sliding in and out of the car. How is that possible after just 14,000 miles of use? It's not a huge problem but one that will likely get worse as the car ages. That truly has been extremely disappointing in a vehicle that stickers close to 40K.In hindsight I'm not exactly sure where this vehicle fits. It's not a sports sedan and the ride certainly doesn't qualify as a luxury cruiser. On the plus side the trunk is quite adequate, the climate control works well and the interior is spacious. I don't think this model has much of a future as the sales numbers have been dismal. Consequently the resale on this car is also not exceptionally good. It's doubtful I would buy this vehicle again but it may offer a great buy as a used vehicle.Update:  Mar 2017Just put 4,000 miles on the car in under two months.  Lots of Interstate driving at high rates of speed.  The vehicle performed beautifully haven't experienced any problems to date other then excessive wear on the driver seat fabric.Update Apr 2018I've only put 3,000 miles on the vehicle since the last update.  Why, because I prefer driving our compact SUV.  The car was purchased for long distance trips which we've reduced to almost nothing.  Not to take anything away from the vehicle, still love it and continue to recommend it for those interested in performance."
Very happy  Very happy with this car. Check for recalls to. Very comfortable car. Impressive for the price.
"I am in love....  I bought the '14 base model Mustang. 0$ in extra features, but I say base model loosely. Base model includes a very good sound system, HID headlights, LED tail lights, electronically selectable steering feel (sport, standard, and comfort), electric everything except for the seats, side air bags, and I'm sure a ton else I cant think of right now. Additionally, this is the most fun car I have ever owned. Despite the V-6 it has 305 horse power stock and rockets off the line. Handling is significantly better than I expected, freeway on/off ramps are so much fun in my Mustang! Out the door I paid $18,100 before tax and license, sticker was $23,500."
"Wish it had better MPG but at least it’s fast  I bought this car used as my first car to get me through college (long trips back and forth to home). It now has 144,000 miles on it and it’s still reliable! So far I’ve had to replace the brake pads and rotars(normal) and a few tire balances but that’s it. Now it is an 11 year old car so there are a few things wrong that aren’t worth fixing such as the front passenger door lock won’t always work so you have to push it on or off manually, and there’s a clean crack on the dash, and there’s some sun damage on the interior paint (none on the exterior). But considering it’s age, and that I’ve never had to pay for any major fixes, this car is a great value and very very reliable. Of course I wish I got better gas mileage but it’s a powerful engine so I got what I asked for I guess."
"One of the best cars I have owned  I bought this car used in 2010 with about 15,000 miles on it. I have owned the car for over 7 years and have never had any major problems, although I did need to replace the brakes at about 50,000 miles. Now with 80,000 miles it needs tires and a battery, which I think is a reasonable life for these items. The car is very comfortable and a joy to drive - peppy, smooth and secure handling. The Infinity sound system is outstanding, although it would be nice to have XM or the ability to play music from an external source. It came with a lot of standard equipment that would likely be optional on other similar vehicles (heated leather power seats, power sunroof, etc). The trunk is massive! The other thing I like is that you don't see a lot of Azeras on the road, so it has a feeling of uniqueness. I will most likely replace my Azera with another Hyundai/Kia model."
"Ten years old and running great!  Bought it used in August '09 with 38k miles on it.  Eight years later it has only 108k on it.  No major repairs during that time.  Combined mileage runs a little over 23 MPG in mixed driving (mostly city and short hwy miles).  It is very roomy and has a nice, big trunk.  With routine service I expect it will last another 100k, at least.  The engine is 263 HP and runs strong."
Azera Rocks  Trunk is enormous and it has been very reliable.
"Great car great reliability  Only drawback is they're known for the dash cracking on the passenger side where the airbag is located and mine did too.  Very roomy, even in the back seats, I'm tall with long legs and have plenty of leg room.  I like the heated leather with 5 settings of heat too."
"Engine Fire...2007 Azera  I owned this car for 3 years.I am 2nd owner.The 2nd owner only gets 5 year, 60K mile warranty.I was about 3 weeks past the 5 years when the engine caught on fire while sitting in a parking lot, turned off.It was a total loss... and also for others parked near by...as they too lit up.The fire started in the very front of the engine compartment.Hyundai denied any assistance or responsibility for the engine fire.They were not interested to investigate.I am just so thankful it happened out in the open, rather than back in my attached garage.I will never own another Hyundai or Kia again.I value my safety and that of my family first."
"Update 1 year later  I'm updating my review from 1 year ago. Since then I have encountered more issues. My dashboard has cracked on the passenger side, where the Airbag is. The cracks are basicially in the shape of where the bag is. Also the rear window shade has gone out for the 2nd time. The paint is fading. I e-mailed Hyundai Usa, and they directed me to a dealership. I have 1 month or 5,000 miles left until the warranty expires (5yr/60k). This is something that should be covered even after expiration, I feel they are both safety issues. Unfortunatly I have to go back to a dealership that lacks customer service and follow-up. I had such high hopes for this Car, but am disappointed in the build/reliability"
"A Good Car Overall  I've had the car since new.Quiet, good performance and decent mpg.A comfortable ride that's been on quite a few long trips.The only problems I've had are an undercar protective panel falling off on the highway (covered under warranty), the Michelin tires lasted only 30k miles and, now, the dash has cracked (I assume the dealer will also cover under warranty).I only have one little occassional rattle but don't they all have at least one?I've enjoyed this car and intend to keep it until at least the end of the warranty period.I would recommend Hyundai to all buyers."
"Issues with our 2007 Azera  We bought a our 2007 Azera new, and have had several issues with the car. I will list only those that I consider more than nuisance value. Cracked dashboard, much like all the other customers. Sound barrier/shroud bolts under car came off like others, dragging from front to back. Latest issue is a failed rear winshield screen motor, which the dealer says has been impossible for him to fix...Car also gives off a tremendous amount of heat under the car on both sides and the rear.Overall, the car has been nice to drive but has so many what seems to be design flaws that it's now clear to me why hyundai does not advertise it or give it showroom floor space."
"2007 Azera Ltd  on 02/24/1119:08 PM (PST) I had both Plastic engine shrouds fall down while driving. I drove it home with them pointing forward hitting the ground. I unbolted the remaining bolts and removed them and took it to our dealer( Poor Customer service), and they questioned me, but I showed where they broke. The car radiates a lot of heat when you get out of the car, by the drivers door, from underneath. I had the Door panels replaced, the Rear shade replaced, the rubber around the sunroof replaced. The battery replaced after 2 years. The ride can be rough, but the power is great. "
"420 HP is Awesome  Just upgraded my '03 GT to the 2014 GT.What a difference.The HP and ride is amazing.Bought one fully loaded with 6-speed, Nav, leather, & GT track pack.I have loved Mustangs since my 1965 in high school.I'm now 58 and like this one the best.Smile on your face every time you get in.After 5000 miles of driving car is still running strong.  No issues at all.  Best performance car value for your money and did I mention the 420 HP is awesome.Ford has really outdone themselves at this price range.$3000 rebates help.Not a fan of the '15 yet that is why I grabbed this one.Sterling Gray color with black leather."
"Great car  This is a great car for the money.  My last two cars were supercharged GM products.  This car has more pickup and more comfort then both. So far I'm getting 26 + miles per gallon with all that power.  It has 60,000 miles on it but runs like new.  Can not even tell that the engine is running.  I love this car."
"Another Cracked Dash  I was a big advocate of my Hyundai azera. I didn't complain about having to wait 6 months to correct the recall on the front seat belt. I didn't complain when the dealers were telling every owner they needed to change the interior air filter? I didn't even complain about the dash cracking. But when I found out that it is a design flaw with the passenger air bag and that hundred of 06 and07 cars have the same problem. That Hyundai changed the style because of the design problem in 08. And, that I can't even get it repaired because of the liability. I complained to Hyundai consumer affairs---they blew me off and won't even return a call! "
"More car for the $$$  The 2007 Azera Limited is a fine car for the money.  This vehicle is compared in construction to some of the BMW series and won!  The Korean car maker is certainly headed in the right direction by providing a luxury vehicle without the high price tag.  The door handles are nicely designed and convenient.  The Infinity sound system rocks! Areas to improve:  Car is heavy when applying brakes, emergency brake light needs a sounder to alert the driver, no auxiliary input for your mp3.  The leather seating is too thin but lumbar support helps.  If your electronic gizmos starts to go wacky, try changing battery first before spending $ at dealership if your warranty runs out. Enjoy your Azera!"
"Yin and Yang  Great car for the money. Looks and sounds high-end. Great engine, nice stereo, acceptable mileage, very quiet inside, transmission is fine. Suspension is rough over bumps yet not firm in the corners. Rear sun shade is nice touch, until it broke (fixed under warranty). Rear mirror fell off. Big car but seat doesn't go back far enough. Trunk does drip in water when opened but that doesn't really bother me. Great trunk w/cargo net & split folding seats. Good in stop/go and on highway. Leather isn't super supple, but is durable. No problems with build quality, rattles, or peeling trim. No mechanical problems. Lots of safety features."
"In the snow  We were recently caught in a bad snow storm in MD and WVa.  The Azera outperformed all the other cars on the road.  It went right through those huge snow drifts, did not fishtail on slippery roads, and all in all was safe and sound.  I love this car and think it is underrated."
"Azera - Great Value!  I needed a car that was not too pretentious, and wanted a car that felt pretentious.  This one solved both items.  It's a fun car to drive and I feel very safe in it.  It doesn't like to go just 35 mph and loves to travel on the open highway. It comes well equipped and the fit and finish is very good.  I've had to have several minor things fixed under warranty, but that was another major selling point of the Hyundai.  The warranty is the best in the industry, and I've had great service from the dealership."
"Great car for the money  Overall this is a great car. Big comfortable well appointed interior. Great performance and mileage for such a large car. Wonderful seats, sound system, climate control, etc. Enormous trunk but opening designed to leak in rain. Mushy suspension which appears to be unfixable. Metal trim in console marginal, fake wood trim peels oddly. Warranty covered halogen foglight bulbs repeatedly, but when plastic panel under car falls off for no reason this was alleged to be ""body damage"" uncovered by warranty. Overall fit and finish excellent but Hyundai seems unwilling to support and stand by car at level which would expect with such a luxurious vehicle."
"What-a-car  I bought this car with 3k mi on it, original owners decided they wanted the Limited. I have the 3.3lt engine which provides 253HP. Very quick and nimble,20mpg in town and 30+ on the highway! Kind of wish i had the 3.8 engine but mileage would suffer. It could use a little more noise dampening and that's about it. Its a full size car, lots of room with a large trunk capacity. Terrific car! "
"Best car I have owned  Of all the cars I have ever owned, be it new or used this is the best one of the bunch. Only problems I have to report are that after three months I couldn't get the XM radio to re-cycle and the pearl white paint seems to chip a little too much for my tastes. A dealer fixed the XM radio in less than a minute. One more thing, tires seem to have flat spots in them until they warm up. Otherwise a great car. I was impressed enough to buy my wife a 2009 Hyundai Sonata, solely on the strength of the Hyundai name. They have come a very, very long way since their first exports here years ago. "
"2007 Azera  This was the the first truly new car we every purchased.  We really like the cars exterior green color and light beige leather interior. The car performs very will and we get about 26.5 MPG on the highway The biggest problem I have with the and maybe I should say the tires that came on it, is road noise.  at 17,000 miles the dealer Car City St Joseph MO replaced one the tires but that really did not solve the problem. Now at 30,800 miles the dealer is saying the tires are cupped.  Telling me its my fault for not rotating then every 7,500 miles.    "
"Absolutely Love It!  My last 'Stang was a '96 GT.My V-6 is faster, and more fun to drive than that car was, though I loved it as well.Acceleration is excellent.More than enough to get me into or out of trouble.I took it on a mountain road, and it cornered great great.Always predictable. IRS will be nice, but I went fast enough to have some fun. I'm not Jeff Gordon.If you're looking for a fun to drive dependable car with plenty of power, and allot of looks, and comments, you'll love this car!Ya, the GT hauled, but I'm getting 29-33 MPG with my V-6.How fast do I need to go?Back seats are ok for 5'9, and under. Don't like Ford's Sync, but it was hardly a deal breaker.I love this car!!"
"Stu's Azera  Purchased this car new. Has everything on it.  At 30,333 miles, I'm getting 32 highway (doing 65mph) and 26 city on the 3.8L engine.  This car was designed for the Korean executive market, and truly has an upscale look and feel to it.  For the dollar, it's a keeper (I'll keep it 10-15 years)!  Do the research on this...you can applaud the Korean auto maker on a job well done!"
"Dissatisfied  We were so excited to own our Azera until the tires went bad. We had only had the car a few months. It became very noisy. The ride is bumpy. Then the rear visor would get stuck and make the most atrocious noise. The handles fell off, the dash cracked. The battery repeatedly died for no apparent reason.  The trunk is awful. It was poorly designed and rain water falls in and wets all my paper documents inside!  I'll buy a Honda or Toyota next time!  "
"warranty issues  The 2007 Azera appears like a great buy due to the features and warranty.  However, the car seems to be built with cheap questionable parts and design.  We've had trouble with door locks, airbags, and accessories.  All were under warranty.  Then the engineer covers under the car actually came off while we were on the highway -- huyndia is not covering it.  So, buyer beware."
"It's the little things.....  Awesome car when it comes to horsepower, handling, and comfort. Sketchy when it comes to overall integrity of the car. Little rattles everywhere! One major metal to metal noise under the car that I can hear through the console that is driving me nuts and my dealer can't seem to hear it! Checked a TSB and found that mine had a ""fix"" for such a noise but it didn't help it at all. My dealer seems lost and now won't agree that there is a noise! Taking it to another and it gets fixed or it goes."
"will buy another  Great car for trip, drove to Niagara Falls Canada average 28 plus mpg around town getting 24 mpg, my sons want to borrow it when they are going on trips "
"love this car  I have owned my Azera for 3 months. We went on a 1700 mile road trip last week. This car is fun to drive, comfortable, quiet, and very responsive. It has the 3.8L V6, and it only has 3500 miles on the odometer. It should get better mileage when it is broken in. I checked the fuel economy and got 28.3 mpg. It holds the road well around curves and when you need to pass on a two lane road the response to a little pressure on the gas peddle is awesome. In conclusion, for the price you can not beat the Hyundai Azera in my opinion. This car is sweeeeet."
Great in the sun not in the snow  Car is very Nice love the comfort and design and very sporty not very good in snow and paint starting to chip near wheel Wells tires not good in rain or slush or very little snow steering wheel wood grain  finish coming off like is chipping 
"Love my Azera Limited  In the past I have purchased/driven Honda Accords, Toyota Avalon, VW Passat, Mazda 6 but this Hyundai Azera is the best car I have had yet. A friend who has a new Cadillac STS drove my Azera and could not believe how much it was like his Cadillac. I call the Azera my poor man's Cadillac. Drives wonderful in the snow and ice (good tires). Current mileage at 11,000 miles is 19.6 mpg. But it runs great on regular unleaded, saving me the cost of premium fuel. A few bad paint spots, paint seems soft. But beautiful gold color, etc. No problems at all. Purchased with Ultimate package. "
"Azera  I have owned Hyundais since 2000, and my wife has since 2006.  I opted for the Azera as my most recent option, and I have been pleasantly surprised with the comfort, style and general reliability of this car.  I've come to expect more from Hyundai, and they deliver."
"2007 Azera Limited  As compared to other vehicles I have driven or owned, this one is exceeding my expectations. Features such as fit, form, feel, function and comfort when compared to similar vehicles is what I consider to be best in class and a value standout. Hyundai is/will be an OEM to contend with. They've raised the bar to the benefit of the end user. "
"Fun Car  I haven't had a ""fun"" car in 30 years due to family & company car requirements.My 2014 basic 6cyl manual is a totally fun ""toy"".I use the Mustang for daily cummute & weekend erands.The car gets an amazing 25.5MPG & the attention the Mustang gets at the gas station is surprising.The 6 speed manual is more fun the longer you own the car."
"azera  Love the car overall, however, lettering on headlight and windshield wiper switch very faint and almost illegible compared to other vehicles in Hyundai line, such as the sonata--trying to find out why--dashboard also replaced as it cracked."
very loud road noise  I never expected to buy a new car and can not hear the radio for road the noise. We talked to the dealer about the problem 2 or 3 times. Funny they say they have not heard that before. We found a talk site on cars and guess what that was one of the biggest complants with the Azera. I do not think it is the tires. I think it has no insulation or sound deading in the car and also has a bad suspension under the car. The bad part is once you buy or lease this car they or done with your concerns.  Beware   David
Hit and Miss but still a great value  Some love the suspension-some hate it. I'm one of the latter. The suspension was good for the first 3-5K then started to feel wore out. Hyundai replaced the shocks and it felt good for another 5K but now back to feeling wore out. Hyundai issued a TSB knowing that the shock were crap but the replacement shocks are still crap. The suspension is noisy and the car wallows and bounces over less than perfect pavement-makes for an annoying ride. Hyundai USA CEO was quoted as saying the Azera's suspension was designed with the Korean market in mind. They should have researched US driver's preferences before marketing in US. This car has a lot going for it but the suspension is not one of them IMHO.
2007 Limited  Now have over 12000 miles with no problems or complaints. Completed a 5000 mile trip in May and averaged 26.5 mpg using air 90% of the time and highway speeds around 80mph. Ran up to 500 miles some days and never felt fatigued. Great passenger comforts and enough luggage space. A wonderful auto for the money. Beats my previous Caddy. 
"Lives up to all of the hype.  I have had my Limited with the Ultimate package for just over a year now.  Everyone who first sees it always asks what the car is.  I got tired of explaining it's a Hyundai Azera, so now I just tell everyone it's an Infiniti.  The car has been getting better and better gas mileage as the engine ages and since I put in a K&N air filter.  I get between 28 and 32 MPG running 75 to 80 MPH now, where I used to get 24 to 28 for the first 10,000 to 15,000 miles at those speeds.  I love the LCD tail lights and the overall look of the vehicle."
"Outstanding Car!!  I researched a bunch of cars, came close to buying a Toyota Camry vs. Nissan Altima until I read about the Hyundai.  I went to the local dealer to look at a 2009 Sonata and ended up falling in love with a used 2007 Azera.  This is by far the best car I've ever owned for a fraction of the price I paid for Mercedes, BMW, Volvo, and Audi.  Congratulations to the South Koreans for producing an outstanding car!  In contrast to other reviews I get about 20 mpg around town and 28-33 on the road."
poor fuel performance  This is an excellent car as a whole . Great radio . Rides smoothly and has excellent pickup. Automatic climate controls work nicely. I have had this car since Nov 07 and have driven 4700 miles since then.
2007 Azera Limited  Traded in my Cadillac while on vacation.  This car is roomy and has a trunk as large as my DeVille.  Fun car to drive and it will get up and go. Very nice leather interior and I love the white pearl exterior.  Engine is exceptionally quiet as well as powerful. Heated seats and folding rear seats and exterior chrome accents make this a special car. 
"hyundai is the way to go!  I traded my 2004 Maxima with only 27,000 miles for the 2007 Azera limited w/ultimate package in August, 2007. My purchase was based on the features included with the car, especially 8 airbags! The Azera outshines my old car in everything wanted or desired in an automobile. The turning radius is unbelievable compared to my trade-in. My wife loves the way the Azera handles, as I do."
"Stiff Seats  I bought my Azera last spring after researching a number of comparable models.  I chose the Azera because of its Consumer Reports ratings compared to other similar models, and the value for all the goodies I wanted. My only complaint is that the seats are incredibly uncomfortable. I thought the seats would soften up but after a year they're just not any better. I found my MPG got much better after my 15 month tune-up when they did the injector service.  I'm now getting about 24-25mpg, with close to 28-29 if I do nothing but highway driving."
"V6 Auto base model  One reviewer said he was looking at Ford because they didn't take government money. I admit that was a consideration for me. I went looking for a Fusion but found they were pricey. I will have to drive the mini van in the snow but that's a necessary compromise in the Midwest. I have 1500 miles on my Mustang now, I'm getting 23 mpg so far (the same as my 08 Grand Prix) and this car makes me smile every time I look at it. You can modify a 'stang but I think mine looks great as is. I'm glad I didn't get a boring car. Bucket List! PS-I do have the auto tran but that wasn't an option for the review. Cost-under 22K. I get the feeling you can get an even better deal if you bargain better than me."
"Just a nice face  I am getting about 20.5 mpg in city driving,slow to down shift.  On mildly rough roads this car is a handful, even after the dealer replaced both front shocks, I still feel every bump in the road. I also own a 2004 Sonata, however, I am going to get rid of this heap ASAP    "
Awesome Ride  Best car for the money. First foreign car I have owned. I purchased a limited in December of 2007. I got the golden beige. My wife liked it so much we bought her one. She got the XM steel Gray. I have almost 7000 miles on mine. Best car I have ever had! Very quiet. Plenty of power. Infinity sound system rocks. I had all the tires aligned and ha nitrogen put in them. No issues with the michelins. Drives like a dream. My wife's car is a program car with 22k miles. She loves it. The entire buying experience was unbelievable. Great experience with dealer. The entire sale was negotiated over the phone. I truly believe that the azera is the most car for the money on the road today!
"Very poor instrument panel poor fuel  The instrument panel lighting is so poor in sunlight can't see odometer or trip meter or Cruise set indicator. Tires have vibration. Poor fuel 23 mpg. Transmission does funny things, as if it does not want to release when coasting.  Should have bot another Buick Lesabre, 27 mpg over 68,000 miles. "
"I love my Hyundai's .....but  Good price, and lots of goodies for the price. Great ride, and if you take care of them, they will not only turn heads on the higher end vehicles, but also keep going for years to come.  I kept my XG350 and continue to drive it in tandem with my Azera.  However, Hyundai does a poor job in transport.  Visually inspect any new purchase very closely.  They are poor when it comes to care after it leaves the plant.  Deep scratches and sometimes missing clearcoat spots seem to be a problem with Hyundai and the attitude extends to it's dealerships."
"Azera Vibrations  The Azera has a vibration issue related to the 17"" Michelin MXV4 tires. Michelin dealers won't replace the tires even after 2 dealers found problems with them, because they didn't sell them. Hyundai won't replace them (300 miles on the second set. Two sets vibrate!)and customer support won't discuss it beyond saying it's Michelin's problem. 17"" low profile tires require nylon that remembers the flat after parking especially in cold temps. Shipping from Korea really puts a flat spot in them that won't come out with driving. Tech bulletins reveal the problem, but Hyundai will not resolve it. Very poor customer relations from Michelin and Hyundai. Demand non-factory tires before buying."
Rocket  The gas mileage is around 20 mpg. The acceleration is awesome. It is easy to hit 100mph just passing a caron the interstate. I got a ticket the first time I went out on the highway.Love this car.
"great value  Very little problems in the first year of ownership.  Service departments are topnotch and will consider buying a Hyundai in the future.  More dealerships would be helpful, it is 45 miles to closest dealer."
"3-Month report  I now have 8,000 miles on my Azera and have loved every minute of driving. Currently showing 26.5 average MPG. People who ride in it can not believe how quiet the engine is and the back seat leg room. "
"Great Car  The Azera is definitely a model I would buy again.  It is comfortable, decent gas mileage, and very quick acceleration.  It is a pleasure to drive."
"Azera Rocks!   After reading thru these forums,I decided to take one for a ride. I was hooked. I traded my beloved 2006 VW GTI which was a blast to drive, but didn't have the amenities the Limited has. First thing I did was to take it on a 8 hr. round trip to Philly thru some real nasty winter weather on I- 81. The car performed flawlessly even though it is shod with all season's instead of winter tires.The seats,ride,power and comfort are just amazing. Also...the  Infinity sound system makes highway cruising a pleasure. I will update after piling on some miles. Take one for a ride...trust me...you won't find better bang for the buck."
"'14 GT, no options  After taking my time and driving all manner of ""budget"" performance cars, I've purchased a brand new '14 GT, $0 in options. No auto trans, no apps, no nothing. V8 with 3 pedals. Bluetooth would've been nice, but not for $1500. You can do better for way less. Cloth seats are great, sound is decent from stock radio. Stock radio reads data MP3 CDs, so if you're thinking of going stock radio don't be deterred because it lacks the USB input. Standard HID headlights and LED tail lights are awesome. The car handles bumps and turns well with stock suspension. If you need a 4 seat car, forget this. [non-permissible content removed]."
"Quick Initial Review - long term to come  I just bought my Azera back in December of 2007. I (like many other owners) researched car after car, month after month, & I finally decided to go with the Azera. It represents a good value for the dollar & a seemingly reliable & quality car.  Though I've had it for roughly 2 months now - I have over 4000 miles on it (mostly if not exclusively highway) and I've become quite accustomed to my car.  Though it needs some improvement to it's fuel economy - I have to admit that it has gotten better over time (in the beginning averaged 19-20, now averaging 22-28). It does have good power but is slow to down shift (unless you use SportShift). Could use an improvement in handing BUT it's sound"
"Terrible Fuel Milage  EPA ratings must be a joke to the Koreans. A loaded truck will get better fuel milage than I am getting with the Azera with 6500 miles on it. I have also had to get the rear window shade repaired. The dealer had to order parts, it would seem that since they have had so many with problems they would just stock parts to repair them. "
"Perfect if ride is fixed     Updated review of Limited with Ultimate package.  At over 7,000 miles and 10 months, everything works perfectly.  Still has the best interior layout of any car I have looked at and exterior is very impressive.     The ride is good, except over road bumps and imperfections.  Even with new shocks, I still feel bumps in the car seat when I hit them.   Tested 2008 Lexus LS 460 and Infiniti M35 last week and still prefer my Azera.  LS rode much better and M35 was somewhat better.    Fun to drive would be a 10 if ride was better.  Get anywhere from 28 to 32 MPG on the interstate at speed limit plus 5 MPH.    Hyundai dealership in Anderson SC has been outstanding and very cooperative.   "
"grandfather car  After owning a dozen new cars I finally found, in my dotage, a car that is comfortable, powerful and smooth-simply a pleasure. it lacks some of the new gadgets as back-up TV and geographic locator but look at what you get for the price of a Camry? So far, fingers crossed, it's a winner."
"Love It  We were deciding between the Hyundai Azera and the Buick Lucerne.  After driving both cars and reading the reviews in Edmunds.com, we decided to purchase the Azera.  The milage is as advertised as we got 29 MPH on a round trip from Phoenix to LA and back. In town we are doing 23/24.  The performance is outstanding.  I really have to be careful not to push it because it is so quick.  The ride is smooth and quiet.  The car is really sharp and we get a lot of comments on how well it looks. "
"BETTER and BETTER EACH DAY  I research this site among others before buying and I definitely am happy after 3 months.  So glad I finally decided to get rid of my volvo s80, which was always a headache. I get 28mpg on highways on my Azera, which surprised me.  I love the sound system, xm radio, seats wipers and auto dimming on mirrors. I bought a garmin gps which tucks neatly into the open storage under the radio.  "
"No apologies: One nice car!  This car is excellent. I hate to say ""for the money"" because that sounds like compromise; Azera makes none. The design is tasteful, classy, elegant and understated, the interior is comfortable and fully appointed, and the driving dynamics are quick, smooth, nimble and competent. No torque oversteer. 5-speed transmission + VVT 263hp V6 turns the car into a ROCKET. Every safety feature in the books. We liked my wife's so much I bought myself one two months later. Feels as good behind the wheel as a GS, 5 or E, for 2/3 the price of an IS, 3 or C. Like I said: NO APOLOGIES! Hyundai has EARNED major respect from a car nut here, and I'll certainly be in line at the dealer when Genesis arrives!"
"Korean Rolls Royce  I am impressed with this car. Great handling, nice ride, awesome performance. Early days yet, but the best car I have owned so far and my fourth brand new one. My last new car was a Porsche Boxster, which was OK. This car for the $ is just awesome. I never enjoyed my Porsche. I am a tall guy - 6ft4, and this is just the perfect fit for me. My first new car was an Opel Monza, then a 95 Accent, Vauxhall Corsa Diesel, Porsche Boxster and now this Azera. I had plenty of used BMW, Mercedes and Renaults as well over the years."
"Love It!!!!  I was looking for a car I could drive 25,000 per year and was fuel efficient. I was looking at the 2008 Sonata and to get the features I wanted I had to get the Limited with the leather. The salesman asked me to see if I would consider another car so he showed me the Azera. I am so glad he did.  This car has tons of room and extremely quiet. Co-workers have quickly commented on how quiet it is. With about 1300 miles on the car I am averaging 27.3 mpg according to the trip computer. I love the cloth seats because living in Florida with leather can be a challenge for the bottom. The seats are very comfy The A/C cools the car quickly. I would highly recommend this car!!"
"Hyundai Finally Reaches Luxury Class  Traded my 2000 Lexus GS300 on this 2007 Azera.  The Azera is of solid  build, very quiet in the cabin, has very comfortable seats, and pretty strong amenity package.  Whilst is is not quite as luxurious inside as the current mid & upper end Lexus', not quite as fun to drive as the BMW & Mercedes, at $10-15K less, it should cause anyone stretching to buy one of these vehicles or one considering an Infiniti or Acura to take pause and review this car.  Even my kids asked who Hyundai was until they rode in this very roomy car.  It is truly a winner and will put Hyundai on the map of near-luxury and luxury cars in the future!!! "
"wow  Wanted something fun to drive without pretentiousness just good old fashion American muscle. Initially picked Ford because they didn't take the government handout and glad I did. This mustang BOSS 302 in race red color is simply outstanding. If I drive it the consciences way to maximize mileage I can achieve the advertised mpg....but with this fantastic motor I just can't resist the power, exhaust note and the fun. Sure the interior is just so-so and the radio it's mediocre but the exterior styling and powertrain are awesome. Thank you Ford."
"SO FOND OF IT  This is it. For this value, Bill Gate would drive Azera. I am completely satisfied with 07 Azera because it drives so smooth and powerfully. Infinity audio system is better than Bose system of FX 35 my wife drives. I test drove ES350, 300M, BMW 530i and so on, but this is the BEST! I look forward to meeting Genesis ( advanced from Azera, I hope )  "
"Actually it's not a cheap car!  Being a Korean, I had many cars from Hyundai before comming to US 10 yrs ago. This one is the best of all (including Avalon I owned in the US). Silky ride and super quietness and the reliability also seems to reach the level of other big name brands. Let me tell you one thing. Some folks even compared this one with Lexus GS, but that's actually not a super surprising comparison. When I visited Korea last summer, I found that the MSRP of Azera GLS (Limited edition is not even available) is around USD 4k in Korea. That said, this car actually is not a cheap car at all, just provided in low price to get into the US market. "
"Amazing Car For Price  This is a comfortable, smooth riding, luxurious car with loads of standard features that would be optional on many vehicles. This is my second Hyundai, and I'm thrilled again.  I researched cars extensively before purchasing the Azera Limited - nothing came close.  You get so much car for the money."
"pursuit of satisfaction  Azera provides the best value in the entry level luxury family sedan segment.  As you purchase it, you will inevitably pursue satisfaction.  The best value and satisfaction come with: quiet and roomy interior driving fun from high-torgue engine no worry with 10 year warranty sophiscated exterior styling etc.  Upgrade yourself with upgraded Hyundai  "
"best value  Hyundai Azera provide the best value for the segment.  For the price, it is the best equipped with a well defined interior space, nice and easy driving, and a good torque.  You will have a continued satisfaction as you drive Azera.  Just go for it."
"2007 Azera  Great car.  Only things I would fix are simple.. Trunk lid drips water  into trunk when you open after washing or rain..  Windshield washer devices mounted on hood are distracting... car feels top heavy when cornering but have not flipped it yet.  Actually has too much headroom.. I'm 6'1"" and I have at least 3 "" of clearance.  Overall milage is 27.3 m.pg  which includes 90 % highway miles at 70 mph +   now have over 24,000 miles in 1 year.  Wheels protrude a bit so junk and rocks etc. tend to hit sides of car.. small mudflaps would help or the design could enclose the wheels better.  Wiper controls are complicated.. when you figure it out they are great.. "
"No excuses & almost absurdly high value!  I am an all-around car nut, been through 3 BMW 5-series, two Tauruses, a Volvo, two Buicks, 3 Jag XJs. This car makes NO excuses. It is not groomed enough to be a full-blooded European sport-luxury sedan but its powertrain, suspension, steering, aesthetics inside & out, and feature set, is every bit the equal of Japanese and Swedish competitors. If you expect a quick, smooth ride, with a silky-smooth transmission, reasonable fuel economy, and a ton of features that make you happy every time you get in the car, then this car is a 10/10 across the board. I give it such high ratings because it does what it says it does almost to perfection. My wife doesn't miss her Vanden Plas one iota!!!"
"I'm Still Smiling  After the issues that I've had with my dealearship, I'm still very happy with my purchase.  The car rides beautifully!  Although other say they get 20-23 mpg I'm only getting 17.5 but maybe because of my lead foot or either an issue with the display.  I tell everyone that I know that I have an Azera and they say a what???  I'm in a way glad that I'm not seeing myself 1000x's on the road."
"The Azera is a great car!  Having owned a number of luxery cars that were far pricier than the Azera, I really think tjhis car is a great value. The interior is very nice and upscale. The ride is soft and smooth, and this might be the quietest car I have ever driven! Plenty of power, good handling... what else could you ask for? I have read many of different reviews on the various Azera forums and have experienced none of the problems that have been discussed. "
"Snug as a bug in a rug  I was looking for a full size and safe car (grandson). Everything I read or researched said this was the car for me. I love it. Smooth comfortable ride,quiet as an atheist in church,plenty of oomph,safety can't be beat. On highways or good back roads it is a dream. Sometimes on rough roads or going over expansion joints on cement roads there is an intrusion of noise into the normally dead silent interior which usually simply engulfs you with serenity.  No hint of looseness and a smooth push of power when you need or want it.  I assume the safety features work as well as the rest of the car.  I have zero regrets in my choice and I am sure I will like this car just as much years from now.  "
"Stock doesn't get any better  I made the mistake of test driving the GT after owning an older V6 mustang. Night and day difference in terms of performance. Without trying you can get your pulse up in just a sec. Not just a straight line car though. Very tight and handles great through the turns. Wasn't looking for the premium package, but the refinement was quite nice. Very comfortable leather seats and nice materials throughout. Gave what I thought was a long shot offer to the dealer and they accepted without even countering. Very pleased with several thousand off MSRP with one of the first 2014s out of the factory. Great fun to drive, plus I can still get around 25 mpg on the highway. Looking forward to driving more."
"Simply Outstanding Value!  This vehicle is simply outstanding. I have the Limited model and am very pleased with it.  The ride, comfort...the technical amenities.  This car is loaded.  You can't ask for more.  I only have three issue with the car...and I'm really nit picking to find two of them.  One is the hunting around gears 3 & 4 when climbing a hill. Two is the visibility of the Radio/Navigation screen during a specific time of day as the sun goes down...it becomes difficult to see due to glare.  The final one...gas mileage, I feel, is more of a byproduct of the ""class"" of vehicle the Azera is trying to compete with.  Big luxury cars usually do not have good gas mileage and this one is no different.  While not the worst MPG on the planet, I've been averaging about 28, it is still about 5 mpg lower than I would like.  A positive spin on the MPG is at ""least"" the vehicle takes 87 grade octane and not the 89 or 91 the other luxury brands call for.  Definitely helps in the wallet.  Other than that, this vehicle is money.  One suggestion that I HIGHLY recommend...make sure, if you buy this from any type of dealer, to purchase whatever extended warranty they are offering.  With this much technology and various bells/whistles something is bound to go wrong; nothing is perfect.  That stuff is super expensive to repair so make sure you are covered.  I bought my car from CarMax with a little over 37,000 miles on it.  The warranty added an extra $40/month to the payment for the top warranty but I'll have no deductible and will get everything fixed, bumper to bumper, for the next 100,000 miles.  One final note.  If you want a ""driver's car"" then do skip the Azera...this is a get from point A to B car in supple comfort, quiet and enjoyment."
"110,000 reasons to like my Azera (Updated 10/5/17)  The '09 Azera has been a great car.  The car itself is a sleeper in value and performance.  You get a luxury car, lots of extras, great materials at a reasonable price.  I really like it and will continue to keep it.  The only drawback I have is that the nav system changed from one manufacturer to another and Hyundai didn't contract to have the updates available.  Therefore the maps haven't been supported in the last half dozen years or so.  I'm sure the newer models are updatable but mine isn't.  Upkeep has been routine, nothing out of the ordinary.  However, tomorrow it goes in to have knock sensors replaced.  The check engine light came on and the remedy is $600 for the dealer to replace the sensors (buried deep in the engine).  I'm not happy about it but after all these years, I'll keep it maintained.  I sure won't be trading it in any time soon.  I would buy another '09 Azera that has been well maintained without hesitation.  BTW, I bought it ""new"" in 2010.  The '09 and '10 are identical and the dealer was anxious to get the older inventory off the lot.Update 10/5/2017 -  It's still going strong.  Now being driven by my son-in-law.  The only repair was a driver door handle.  Took 10-15 min to replace.  I purchased a 2017 Azera Limited.  It has all the bells and whistles but to be honest, I still like the handling and performance of the '09.  Having the '09 with the '17 technology would be the best of both worlds.   I haven't changed and would buy a well maintained '09 Azera in a heartbeat."
"Best Car I've Owned So Far!  I've had Volvos, Chryslers, Nissans, and Subarus. But, I've owned my Azera Limited for about 2 years now, and it is the best car I've ever owned, hands down. It is comfortable, powerful, fuel efficient, has a great sound system, and is SAFE! Consistently averages about 25-26mpg at speeds of 80mph, close to 30mpg around 70mph. I was also rear-ended at about 50mph in this car, the appraisers and auto body employees said if I was hit at any higher speed the car would've been totaled, but I came out completely unscathed! No whiplash or even a backache! It also performs very well in inclement weather, remains sure footed in rain, and the ESC system helps a lot in the snow as I have never gotten stuck and rarely slide around. It is also an extremely reliable car, I have never had any issues with anything on it. This is definitely a diamond in the rough car for Hyundai, and I will proudly buy more Hyundai products for many years to come because of my experiences with this one!"
"Great car but not for snow!  I had my Azera for over two years and I absolutely loved it! However, with any kind of ice on the road, the car became completely undrivable. I had really good tires on it and even going down straight, smooth, flat roads with any type of ice on them, the car would fishtail all over the place. Ultimately, I decided I had to trade it in or risk winding up in the ditch in the winter. If I lived where there was no snow, I would have never given this car up! I was told by a dealership that even with studded tires, the car would still act the same way. It's a car meant for cruising and that it does very well."
Azera   My wife is the major driver and she loves the car and the features like heated seats etc. After correcting a tire problem the car is once again riding very smooth with good handling capabilities.
"A finer car than I imagined  I was looking for a comfortable, quiet good handling car, and the Azera exceeds my expectations.   On two recent longer trips the mileage was between 27 & 29 mpg, which for a 3.8 liter engine running on regular fuel is very respectable.  Wish the ""around town"" mileage were a bit better (at around 22+).   The quality and features are outstanding and are the equal or better than cars costing several thousands more.   Great power, great sound system, comfortable seats, and good visibility.  Hope Hyundai retains the Azera along with the new Genesis. I can certainly heartily recommend this automobile."
"Best car I've ever owned!  I spend a lot of time driving since I commute 4 hrs per day. Thus, I have already put 29K miles on this car in only 11 mos.  I am 59 and have owned/driven a lot of cars, including some very expensive ones (both foreign & domestic).  And this car is, without a doubt, ""the best"" car I have ever owned.  Hyundai is producing some great products at a reasonable price.  The closest equivalent car would be a Toyota Avalon; but the Azera rides better, is more powerful, quieter, and more responsive in handling.  Yet the price of an Azera is thousands less than an Avalon.  Great workmanship & reliability: like I said, I have put 29K miles on this car already without any mechanical problems. Great car!"
"Great Car  This may be the finest car I have ever owned.  I bought fun it new during the year end closeout, and have enjoyed it since day one. The mileage I have experienced actually exceeds the EPA estimates. I am getting is in excess of 30mpg in highway driving, and the car is not yet fully broken in. It is quiet and comfortable, and is fun to drive. It has plenty of ""oomph"" at all speeds."
"Few Faults With This One  I've had the car 5 months, put over 5,000 miles on it, and have found two faults. Sunlight falls on the navigation/audio screen with near blinding effect, and substantial road noise occurs at interstate speeds. That's it. I enjoy driving the car so much that I usually regret reaching my destination. Initially the ride was hard but the cause was simply over inflated tires. Unexpectedly at 5K miles I have had a significant uptick in mileage and now get well over EPA average. I am so ""sold"" on Hyundai now that I expect to move up to the very quiet Genesis with my next purchase."
"Just bought it and love it!!!  I was actually looking at the new Genesis, but financially the Azera was a better fit for me.  I think it is a mistake for Hyundai to discontinue this car because it fits right between the Sonata and Genesis on price point, but oh, well...........  Very happy with my choice and Hyundai of New Bern is the best!!! I love this car.  "
"I Love my Pony car  Allow me to start by saying I bought mine used. I have always loved the S197 model with its call back to the 60s. This was my first convertible. I live 30 miles from the coast here in Texas. This car is perfect. With 305 hp, this pretty girl will get me on and off the freeway with no worries. You can feel the power from the Solid Rear Axle. At 70 mph,  if you need to pass, then give it gas. It still pulls with muscle. Mine is sterling gray, so named her Storm because she looks like a storm on the horizon. (Plus,Storm is a stripper name and she takes her top down) I had an issue with her going to limp mode after I got her. Took Lee in under the 90 Day dealership warranty. Turns out she had a bad molded lead frame (the computer brain and sensor panel for the transmission. I paid $60 dollars on a $1200 dollar job. Being a used car, I say that’s more than fair. Now she runs beautifully and is perfect for driving the back roads down to the coast with the top down. With a little mood music or a good playlist it turns a commute to a mini vacation."
"Great car-Poor MPG  This is one great car except for the city MPG which I am getting only 13-14 mpg. On a trip to the Hyundai factory in Montgomery AL. I averaged 27MPG which is  respectable. That plant is really something to see and worth the 650 mile trip each way. My poor gas mileage is on file with my dealer, Maybe I have a lemon which I am following up on. "
"All  I hoped for, almost  It is possible to find faults with this car.  At interstate speeds road and wind noise are substantial. Sun light falls on the audio/navi screen making it almost unreadable.  Otherwise the car is a pure delight to drive.  I normally regret reaching my destination. The car is attractive, comfortable, powerful, and has many amenities.  Cabin and trunk are spacious also.  Just what I wanted excepting the two features mentioned above."
"Concert Hall on Wheels- a Real Gem  This is an amazing great car with unmatched value. My wife and I absolutely love it. Our friends are very impressed. We've owned it for 4 months and I waited until now to do the review. At 3500 miles, with majority (~80%) highway driving, the long-term mileage has been 24 mpg. As the flagship for Hyundai until the Genesis, one clearly senses that a whole lot of thought had gone into the design, and care into the build of this car. So far, this has been the most issue-free car I've owned, including Camrys and Accords. There are people who would rave about this car if it was a luxury brand, but are more reserved as a Hyundai product. The Azera should be continued, to convert these skeptics. "
"More BANG for the buck!!  We bought this fine vehicle on August 4th,2008 and been very satisfied with it in all respects except one - a bumpy shift from lower gears to drive. While I find this to be irritating it still does not diminish my enjoying my Azera.  "
"One Great Car  I purchase the Hyundai Azera Limited after having a Camry for only 15 months (which also was purchsed new) The Azera Ltd. has much more power with just scacrificeing a mile or two MPG.  The ride is top knotch and the sound system is awesome.  Braking is aggressive.  The ""manual"" shift mode is fun on the twisty roads.  Fold-in mirrors is a great auto car wash feature.  I found out that the Sun Screen in the back window is not only good on sunny days, but also a benefit when the guy behind you has his brights on.  So far this car has been a pleasure to drive and own."
"Great Car--Not Great Car for the Money  Having come from a heavy Lincoln Town Car with a 205HP engine, I can say that I would be happy with the 233HP engine. With the 263HP engine, it's a rocket. The drive-ability is amazing. It's very sure footed, even in the rain. It's not unusual for me to drive over 500 miles in a day. This car is comfortable on those long hauls. With slightly more than 20K miles on the car, nothing - nothing - has gone wrong!"
"Unbeatable for the price  What a beauty! One option package includes everything. The fit and finish is excellent. Whomever rides in it has nothing but raves.I have had this car for only 21/2 weeks and have not found a thing wrong with it. The price with all thw whistles and bells is so far below the competitions price. The public does not know what they are missing. It was the top of the Hyundai line but probably will be replaced by the Genesis which goes for about $40,000.  Too bad! I'll write follow- up in 6 months and see if I still love it."
"Disappointed by the little things  While the fit & finish are nice, I find the front driver's seat to be extremely uncomfortable and I'm only 5'9"". The auto headlights are sensitive enough; the auto windshields wipers behave erratically; the heating- /A/C defaults to A/C ""compressor on"" and most of the settings on the trip computer reset every time you start the car. On top of that, the Check Engine Light came on after only 24 hours with the car. had it only 3 weeks but considering a trade in. On the whole disappointed by the little things."
"I LOVE IT - LOVE IT - LOVE IT!  This car is amazing! I have a 1999  tiburon - which I love. That was the best car I have ever had - so I knew I wanted another Hyundai. I was looking at the sonata - then I spotted Azzy. There was no going back! The price - for all the features was terrific. I did look at the Genesis - just for fun - but to tell the Truth - I still preferred the azera. I have had no problem with the suspension. Best of all-this is a car that ""fits"" me. The controls for the seats - with a memory is amazing - and the pedals move too!  I don't have to try to get my seat perfect time and time again after ""he"" drives it. ""He"" insists he loves his ugly Chevy truck - but he jumps in my car every chance he gets!"
"Bought another Hyundai.   This will be my 3rd Hyundai. My Son drives my old 2003 Sonata with 160K on it. I traded my 07 Santa Fe AWD for this car as I commute to work almost 100 miles a day and need better MPG's.  I didn't need or want the Limited as the GLS have all the options I preferred.  I have owned it only a couple days and the mileage is 25 mpg but that is a lot of highway.  I expect even better once the car is broke in. If you are looking for an Azera, the deals are out there. I got about 5K off the MSRP. "
"Bought it new, falling apart  The 2006 Mustang v6 Coupe is my 7th Mustang, I bought it new off the lot, and it's left me stranded all over town--thank God I have roadside assistance!  After two years of ownership a dead battery left me stranded out at work at midnight, in March I'll have had the car 3 years and I just had to put a new transmission in it at 68,000 miles. The Ford dealer said that since I hadn't had the transmission serviced at 30,000 mile intervals like the manual says I need to, they can't help. I've not had the oil changed exactly every 3,000 miles, does this mean the engine is going to blow?  Very poor quality."
"The bottom top  The support bar for the top in back has a cap that fell halfway off a week after I purchased my new Mustang, and I snapped it back in place a couple times over the next week or so. After about two weeks I found a small hole in my top, drivers side and 5-6 inches up, it was shaped like a little finger nail. When I took it in to have it looked at, Dewey Ford in Ankeny, Iowa, the serviceman said he would have to take pictures and send them to Ford. A few days later he called me and said Ford wanted pictures from the inside, the sides and as it is raised and lowered. The serviceman took pictures as requested by Ford, stopping several time on the way up and down, and he took several shots up close to the hole I was having checked. When the top was put back up there was then a second hole that looked just like the first one. The serviceman took several close up shots on both of the holes and sent them into Ford for evaluation. Several days later he contacted me and told me Ford said it is not their responsibility because ""It is vandalism"". I ended up having to go through my insurance company and it cost me $200, I have a very low deduction rate. The plastic cap on the support bar was missing some screws, but when it was repaired they just put a couple zip ties on it to hold it. When the top was replace with an original ford top I had them screw the cap on like it should have been do to start, it was the Chevy dealer that replaced it."
"Lots of research paid off  From the initial test drive, the car didn't inspire a lot of ""oh-wow!"" comments, but it was an interesting design. Seats leave a little bit to be desired in terms of thigh support, and the leather stitching on the black (gray) leather is ugly. But, I basically love this car. Bluetooth works great. Trunk size is very good. I have some problems with the transmission at slow speeds, as I drive the Washington DC beltway each day. But, overall I would definitely buy this car again. Without doubt, this is one of the greatest values available."
"1st Years Fun Azera Diving Experience  This past year's 15,000 mile driving experience  has been extremely enjoyable in our new azera ltd/ultimate. It gives great performance on regular gas. It included a 4700 mile trip of the maritimes (24.6 mpg), a 2667 mile trip to Baton Rouge, la. ( 23.8 mpg), and a 1961 mile to branson, mo. (22 mpg). On regular gas, the 5 speed automatic transmission, plus the dohc 3.8 liter al block v6 was much lighter on the front end, and performed better than the supercharged 3.8 cast iron block (premium gas) 1997 olds lss (4 speed automatic) car it replaced. In over all fact the much more completely featured azera was purchased in current dollars for less than my cost for the (new) 1997 olds. Great buy for the money."
"Good value, nice vehcile  Have owned a 2009 GLS with the Premium Package for 2 months/1,600mi.  Didnt need the extra bells and the larger engine, so saved a few $$$.  Comfortable ride and generously sized for 2 teens in the back seat.   Does not feel big and is easy to park and maneuver in traffic.  Plenty of power on hills (we live at 6,800 ft in Colorado and go up and down in elevation constantly), plus an average 21-22mpg on about 50/50 city/hwy driving.  (yes, I do drive it nicely)  There is plenty of power available if you choose to use it.  I was quite surprised when I jumped on it the first time-got up to speed in no time!   We did look at Honda, Toyota and Nissan and are happy with our decision."
Better than BMWs or Lexus for the price  I wanted the Azera ever since they came out and finally purchased the loaded Limited with navigation.  The car is fantastic; fun to drive. great firm suspension with a sports car feel; interior is top notch.  The many features you get with the Limited would cost a fortune if purchased with a BMW or Lexus.  I'm looking forward to t nice road trip to the Florida Keys in April and expect to get 27 or so MPG.  The 3.8 ltr engine is real quick and powerful.  Passing on the interstate is easy.  You have to remember to check the speedometer because 80 and 90 mph comes up before you realize it.  You can't go wrong with the Azera.
"Watch out for this car suspension!  The driving is fun. Powerfull car nice well finish lots of details making this car amazing. The suspension is not so great, is very stiff so if you don't like the feel of the road ""Do not purchase this car"" I can't wait to trade in for some other and remember I purchase this car not even 3 months ago."
"'09 Azera Limited  My '09 Azera Limited offers alot of bang for the buck.  I have owned 6 Hyundais previously, including a '99 Elantra, '03 Sonata, '04 XG350L, '05 XG350L, '08 Sonata GLS and an '08 Sonata SE V-6.  The Azera is second best only to the Genesis.  I love the features that the Limited offers including the 12 speaker Infinity sound system, smooth 3.8L V-6, roomy interior, smooth ride and great handling in the snow and on the ice.  This vehicle has LESS wind and road noise than an Infiniti M45x.  "
"A Happy Day  After two weeks of reading automobile reviews and visiting showrooms I came to the conclusion that the vehicle that had the most to offer for a very reasonable price was the Hyundai Azera. This sedan has everything that I was looking for, style both inside and out, performance and price. We bought our Azera Limited in early August and already have driven it over 4,000 comfortable and enjoyable miles. It is, in my opinion, one of the best values available to anyone in the market to buy a new car today.   "
"Couldn't say enough good things.  I did the research online and with Consumer Reports.  Came down the Azera or the Toyota Avalon.  Drove the Avalon, nice ride but handling was way to mushy. The Azera was much tighter, lots of power. Car has every option except bluetooth. Incredible trunk space.  Drove it from Colorado to my folks in Nebraska with my Wife, Daughter, SIL and Grandson. Babying it on the interstate I got 31mpg, coming home with that load and 100lbs of apples at 75mph constant I got 27mpg.  I would have like more mpg, but the available power is incredible. Haven't driven anything this much fun since my 71 Firebird.  The heating/AC is great, dash and instrument layout is great. 10Y/100K warranty, closed the deal."
All I Expected & More  I researched and drove all of the competitors in the full size market. None compared favorably with the features and creature comforts that the Azera offered. It was as much or more comfortable. The interior touches and controls are logical and well designed. The reported issues with the suspension and noise are non-existent in my 2009 LTD. It is exceptionally quiet and the sound system is awesome. The rear sun- shade and memory driver seat make it a joy to drive.  
"2009 Hyundai Azera Limited  After hearing so many of friends rave about their Hyundais I finally decided to investigate when I needed to replace my 2000 Volvo V40. Well, I was equally impressed, with both the reviews and the car. I wasn't planning on buying right away but the value of price & luxury that the Azera offered was too tempting & I have not been disappointed at all after having the Azera for just a week. I have put on over 600 miles on it already. Plush seating, fantastic sound system, more than ample interior space, plenty of power when needed along with stylish looks. This is by far the nicest most ""decked"" out vehicle I've ever owned & it didn't break my bank either! It blows my old V40 away in every way!"
"What a RIDE!!!  The only problem I have with this car was FORD decided to place 1st gear and REVERSE together.  Having learned and used 5th gear for REVERSE for years, I couldn't get comfortable with it being in 1st.  Lots of stops with sudden movements BACKWARDS!"
"Update  Just a quick update since my post of 06-01-2008. I am still happy with my decision. I have since had the chance to take the car on a thousand mile trip. The car rode very well and my MPG was 26 @ about 80 to 85 miles per hour. So thus far the car has worked as advertised, I am very pleased."
"2009 Azera Limited  Just got the 2009 Azera Limited two days ago, thus far I am pleased with my decision. Being an old mechanic I had a hard time making the decision to buy a Hyundai. I always told my customers to buy Toyota, Honda, or Nissan, but after doing some research and driving the car I will add Hyundai to my list of cars I recommend. I was considering the Toyota Avalon Limited, but for about $6,000.00 less I got a comparably equipped Hyundai. The only difference I noticed was the Avalon had a quieter ride, but not enough so to justify the price difference.  "
"A shadow in the night  Have you ever been outside on a hot July summer night. The street is warm, and the wind is at a stand-still. Then all of the sudden a car whisp by and you don't even see it. That is what happpens when the new Hyundai azera comes through. People don't know what happened. The design is one of a kind. It has a 3.8 liter, or 3.3 liter. Enough hp's to throw your head back. The leather is smooth.   Really if it had a Honda or Toyota tag, the dealership could not get enough models in stock. So I recommend this car. You shoul go drive drive."
"Our second Azera- better than the first-  Only available as a used car- this model has been discontinued. It is a comfortable and thoughtfully designed car.  Ours is the Tech model- the extras are really worthwhile e.g., heated and cooled seats, rear windows shades-power back window shade, ""panoramic"" sunroof. Great storage and seat comfort: a really good highway car. Rough pavement bounces are felt. Highway 29-32 mpg.                           Precise steering and very good handling on road."
"Review from a pro  I am a ride share driver. I drive 2,000 miles a month. This car is extremely comfortable to sit in and drive. Besides looking terrific you want to be comfortable in your car. With the technology package or the Limited trim, this car has everything that a 12 cylinder Mercedes and stretch limo has. Ventilated and heated seats, rear side window shades. Rear window shade that automatically goes down when you back up. Enormous panoramic sunroof. Widest driver seat ever because the power controls to adjust the seat are on the door and not on the lower left side of the seat. Therefore they didn’t need to leave an empty space for your arm to fit between the door and seat to access the seats power controls, thus they used that room to widen the seat. Very comfortable. Lots more bells and whistles, but as many as a $70,000 cars.  Enjoy yourself when you drive!!"
"Wonda hyndai  Great car but visibility bad for short people, sold it for suv for better biew."
Great first 2 years  Has declined over the last three years
"Excellent - watch out Toyota  We have two Azeras, a 2006 Limited and a 2013 Tech. The attention to detail on both is very good. The 2013 is a great travel car and the back seats are very comfortable, we have yet to discover a problem with this car. The panoramic sun-moon roof functions as expected and the heating/cooling is even. The rear window power shade is a great feature.  Highway mileage is ~30 mpg.  Instrumentation is thoughtful. It is unfortunate that the Azera will no longer be manufactured after 2017."
"Snazzy Azzy  I am a previous owner of a new 2006 Azera Limited. That car was newly re-designed and different so I gave it a try .....with NO regrets! I still own that one and it is running trouble free at 160,000 miles with very minimal service of any type. I admit I sometimes skimped on oil changes too! When the newly designed 2012 model came out, I was so impressed by the ""look"" that I kept my eye on them. As an excuse to go shopping again, I gave my 2006 to my oldest and purchased a 2013 from a dealer with 44,000 miles. This car has it all! I looked and found a ""midnight blue"" which is spectacular! It actually looks like different colors depending on the angle of the sun. A bit hard to keep clean but it is beautiful and sets off the chrome accents around the car. The 2006 Azera came with the 3.8 L V6 while the 2013 has a 3.3 L GDI V6. The smaller engine seems almost as smooth and powerful as the larger but it has increased horse power and I can get 32 MPG highway at 80 MPH! The cabin is more like a jet airplane with great materials and feel. Seats are extremely nice and the AC cooled seats really give a nice effect when you're hot. There are a lot of options in this car and it took me a few weeks to learn them all. The technology package throws in the kitchen sink. The full size tinted panorama roof is IMPRESSIVE! This may overwhelm people who prefer more basic controls but I love them. The sound system is 550W and powerful. May think of upgrading the speakers. The car even has a cooled glove box!! One of my biggest complaints about the 2006 Azera was poor headlights, even with xenon bulbs. My 2013 has pure white HID low beams which really improve visibility. One thing to note is that in USA, a used Hyundai 100K mile warranty reduces to 60K but that still beats most makers and I had any warranty issues on the 2006 fixed immediately and for free every time. My main issues with the 2013 are (improved) but still numb feel at steering and road noise and feel on rough roads with the stock tires. If this car is as reliable as the 2006 then I will be back for a third Hyundai in the future. If you like to be unique and stand out in the crowd, and impress all who ride with you, this car has the most bang for the buck and can be found reasonably priced in the used market. This car is for someone who likes to be different from the crowd and I personally think the 2013 Azera looks better that the newer Hyundais or Genesis models."
Good for the buck  I love the curves of the car. I love the many options that it came with as standard. I love the price and the power train warranty. The audio is terrible though and the ride a little bumpy.  I am getting about 16 miles to the gallon instead of 20 for city driving. Will keep an eye on that especially as I have it on ECO.
I love my mustang  Great value for what you get. I will buy another one
"Big Value for Price  I am 27 years old and I have only owned luxury cars: Mercedes and BMW. When I was ready to move on from my BMW I walked into the dealership knowing I was going to leave with an Acura TLX. I drove the TLX and a Kia Optima but they did not have everything I was looking for. My boyfriend suggested I drive the 2013 Hyundai Azera (used obviously). I was hesitant because I have never heard of it but after driving I was unsure why I have never heard of it!! The exterior looked sporty yet luxurious, the inside was spacious (front, back and trunk space), the interior design was so impressive (comparable to anything I had with my past luxury PLUS some!). I drove it like I would everyday and it was smooth and fast. The cabin was so quiet. The mpg was a huge consideration for me which the Azera did well for a luxury car. And the price for what I was getting was amazing to me!  I was sold. I left that day with it. I am almost 5 months into owning it and I could not be happier. I have not had any issues with it and I was in one small fender bender where the other persons car was damaged but mine was not at all which was very impressive. Every time someone gets in my car they ask me ""what kind of car is this again? This is really nice!"" I had someone get upset after I told them what I spent for it and they felt stupid for buying their car for way more and getting way less. I love my car! This car should be talked about more."
"Going back to Nissan!  I had a 2002 Nissan Maxima SE and I loved it. What a super car and my oldest son recently turned it in to purchase his first Car. Back in 2013, just after I turned 50, I decided I would join my wife and get a new car. I liked the way the Azera looked, test drove it and decided to buy one. I wish I hadn't. The pros: the ride is decent, the car looks good, and it is roomy. The Cons: cheap interior(Trim on the steering wheel is peeling), the Bluetooth is (awful had to get it replaced once and people always complain it is hard to hear), Black soot is present in the exhaust pipes(Since Day 1 and I have seen other Azeras with the same issue) and the BIGGEST CON..the finish on all four 19"" inch Alloy wheels is peeling and Hyundai(nor my dealer - Burns Hyundai in Marlton, NJ) will not replace them. The car will be sold shortly and I will be going back to Nissan."
"Bought First Hyundai in US. Hyundai's Ever Since  I and my family have owned Hyundai's for over 29 years. That's right ""FOR OVER 29 YEARS.  Hyundai entered the U.S. market in 1986 with the introduction of its subcompact Excel. Our family has bought and enjoyed every Hyundai we have purchased since that time. We have owned over 8 Hyundai's since their conception in the United States. Long story short, 'ALL' have performed exceptionally well with minimal and or no repair required. They have improved exceptionally over the years and in my opinion, Hyundai is one of the best keep secrets in the automotive industry and one of the best vehicles on the road today. All of us are committed to Hyundai and will but nothing else. As far as my current vehicle, the 2013 Azera, 'FANTASTIC' . Friends of ours have had their Chevy' s and Fords in the shop multiple times for repairs. Not our Hyundai's."
"I hate this car  This is probably the 15th car I have owned and I have had only a few clunkers, but this one takes the cake.  It is not the ""big"" issues, I have not had any mechanical issues, but it is the little things.  If I can recall them, they are:>  The placement of the power seat controls are on the doors near the C(?) pillar so that in order for either the driver or passenger to recline the seat or move it all the way to the rear you have to maintain a sit up until the operation is done.  Ditto when you want to return the seat to its normal position, a sit up is needed.>  The GPS is difficult to program, and it has a tendency to take you on strange routes, going from our home to my daughters in Dallas the last 20 miles it had us on narrow two lane roads when there were major 4 lanes and decent two lanes available, and it would have been shorter, faster.  Even on moderately near destinations, 50 miles or so, it has a tendency to misdirect you right as you near the destination, it has had us turn West when we should have gone East on X road just a half mile from the destination.  A terrible terrible system.  It does not show the roads you are coming upon   either.  I suppose it does tell you many POIs such as rest areas, but I would have had to take out the manual to find out how, gads this bloody thing has at least 3, yes 3, manuals!  The piece de resistance though is that in most cars with the GPS factory installed have a hood surrounding it so the glare from the sun is minimized.  Not this car, there are times during a sunny day one cannot see the display.>  The sound system has an awesome sound I believe it has 12 speakers, an infinity system.  BUT, it is not intuitive on how to program stations you want to save.  It is nice to be able to save, what is it 18 stations per band, BUT, when you push the steering wheel control to move to the next station it only allows the six stations shown.  To get to the others you have to take your eyes off the road to select the next 6 and so on.  On my GMC it flows from channel to channel and once you have gone through all the channels you can reverse.  I will say though, the saving grace is the voice command.  It works well.  (I never did figure out how to instruct it to get directions via the GPS, I only used it to find me a station to listen to).  >  I have heated and cooling seats in the front and to heater work fine, but after the first summer season the cooling seats for the driver were minimally effective, I could live with it, but when I first got the car it made me cold, not now, though I am comfortable but gee.  >  I lived in the Detroit area for nearly 40 years and learned to drive there.  I was livid to find out that I had wheel locks placed on the car.   Not one, not one person I know anywhere has lost a wheel to thieves, not in Detroit or here in Ohio where I now live.   The key was gone when I first went for a rotation and was asked for the key, I was nonplussed.  I had to order a key for $15, and could not buy new lug nuts as in the infinite wisdom of Hyundai the lug nuts are not a standard size I had to have the dealer replace the lug nuts for another 20.  This is not an option I would tout if I were them.  Can you imagine your spouse having a tire issue anywhere and not being able to take your wheel/tire off because it is locked?  Whew!>  It seems to that Hyundai has an issue wherein you press on the gas and the car thinks for 3-4 seconds before it responds.  Drives me nuts, and of course the dealer comes back, ""it is normal we find nothing wrong""  I compained 3 times. I have driven for nearly 40 years and have owned multiple cars and vans.  My brother worked at GM in engines as an engineer, this is not normal.  I am not a fool.I expected this to be the last car I would buy as I am now in my 60s. but I am going to get rid of this damn thing and buy something else.  I am sure there is other issues, for instance I do not like the keyless entry and start feature, but my wife does.  The big issue for me is that when I am exiting the car and press the lock button if I am still coming out it will not lock.  I don't like that, but my wife has no problem so i mention it but it really is not too big an issue."
"My other Mercedes Benz  After owning 3 Mercedes E-Class sedans, we bought this car for $22,000 less and after driving it for 4 years and 43000 miles I say it is better than the Mercedes. It doesn't cost $2000 per year to maintain. Doesn't need new brake pads at 23,000 miles and tires at 30,000 miles and on and on.Now have 37,000 miles and it is 3 years old. definitely the least expensive car to maintain that I have ever owned. Can't say enough about the quiet comfortable ride."
Great Buy!!  Best choice and Hidden Hyundai jewel.  My car  has nothing TO ENVY to the expensive make and models out there. It it's fully equipped and handles great.
"Great MPG, luxury for less, awesome stereo  I buy new cars about every 2 to 3 years, i get bored with them, i have had Lexus, BMW, Infiniti, Honda and Toyotas all good cars but nothing more, but the 2013 Azera had the look, paint color, nice looking wheels, plenty of leg room and back seat has a lot of room for adults not just kids, consistent  mpg 21 city and 30 to 32 on interstate i normally set my cruise 5 above limit and leave it,  a V6 with great passing power and merging is a breeze always has plenty of get up and go power very smooth six speed auto transmission never wanders looking for gears like my last Lexus did, the heated and cooled seats are great and work awesome also has rear heated seats that my kids love,  what sold me on car was the Infinity car stereo plenty of bass and clear crisp music 550 watts sounds are amazing that come from this stereo satellite radio is works great unlike some past cars, and the quiet interior and great ride also surprised me, only thing that really bugged me is the fact that remote start is not on a $40,000 car, and have to pay over $300 a year for bluelink if i want remote start from a phone. The panoramic moon roof is very nice i never liked moon roofs before always thought they were to small but on this Azera its huge.   The Navigation is a clear crisp picture not grainy like most, easy to use and read, the bluetooth for phone is very easy to use and setup. The trunk has enough room for 2 full size suit cases, 2 kids suit cases and a full size cooler and still have room in trunk.  I have not noticed any difference in fuel octanes 87 or 91 engine always runs smooth and same mpg, unlike other cars i have had that say 87 octane is ok to use but run better and smoother on 91, I never thought i would ever drive or buy a Hyundai but dont knock it till you at least drive it, before i bought the Azera i test drove 2013 Lincoln MKZ and MKS, 2014 Lexus ES350, Infiniti m series, 2012 and 2013 Toyota Avalon, 2012 Nissan Maxima, 2012 Acura TL,  2013 Accord V6, 2014 Impala LTZ, and fell in love with a Azera features and comforts.  Began experiencing problems around 50k new timing chains, timing chain tensioner, new cam phasers, oil leaks, misfires on numerous cylinders after that they finally decided to put in a new engine at 55k just got it back today so time will tell"
"My Azera has really changed my opinion of Hyundai!  My wife and I were in the market for a new car.  We looked at Maximas, Fusions, Camrys, Avalons, etc... and could never find a car that we absolutely fell in love with.  I mentioned a Hyundai Genesis that I'd driven as a rental while traveling for business.  We decided to give Hyundai a look, but wasn't really expecting much.  We found the Azera and were instantly blown away by every detail!  This tech package car has it all....sleek/sporty looks, plenty of room for a family of 4 (was very surprised by how much space the interior has), premium leather, Infinity sound system, Bluetooth tech package/navigation system, panoramic sunroof, power back glass shade, great power heated AND cooled seats.  While all this was nice, we needed something that would be economical.  To our surprise, we are able to get anywhere from 26 to 30mpg in this!  Plus, this car drives like a sports car!  If you haven't tried one, you are DEFINITELY missing out!!!"
"Very comfortable to ride, but not to drive  We have owned this car for 2 months, and mostly drive it in the foothills of Smoky Mts. The car drives firm. At low speeds it instills a sense of confidence. The ride quality is one of the best  quiet and very comfortable, suited best as a family sedan. But some glaring shortcomings in driving experience show up in hilly roads. The car drives and steers  sluggish in the ECO/Automatic  modes. In the Sports/ Manual  mode, the car is somewhat more fun to drive. Yet, Azera is best suited as chauffer-driven limo, where one can enjoy astounding rear-seat comfort, fantastic leather, and the panorama of the sunroof, and forget the shortcomings in the driving experience. "
"Loving my Azera!  I absolutely love this car! I have the Smoke Grey Metallic w/ tech pkg. You rarely see it on the street unlike the Sonata which is everywhere. It's so much car for the money, perfect for business or a night out on the town. Loads of room and I am so glad that they included a 40/60 folding back seat as this does come in handy for those of us with kids. The leather is beautiful and the heated seats are great.Now for the critique: for a car of this price you should not have to subscribe to a service for remote start period Hyundai really dropped the ball with this one; it should be standard period! Also at 2500 miles I am still not getting the advertised mileage but I am getting closer."
"LOVE LOVE MY PONY!  I have always wanted a Mustang Convertible! I did some research as to what I wanted, I knew I didn't want brand new. I found this baby for not only a great price but in perfect condition. I did have her detailed as the dealers just don't do justice for a wash. She is beautiful and I didn't think I would love a car as much as I love her! She just wants to go when I am on the open road. I live in a beach town so the convertible is a must and turns many a head! I am sure the gas will go quicker as I love to just drive her. There is not much room in the back for large adults so if you have more than two people on a regular basis, I would not go for this. But the average adult once in awhile will enjoy it as much as I do."
"Unexpected Find  Was in the market for a Cadillac, we test drove and was very disappointed in the ride of the vehicle. Owned several Hyundai's in the past and currently own two. None of the cars we owned ever given us any major problems. We to car lot to look at Santa Fe's, Tucson's, and Sonata's when we discovered the Azera. I have always thought that the Azera's were priced in the same category as the Genesis. Long story short love the look, style, and comfort of this vehicle. And it made my wife smile which was the number one reason I Love it.."
"Great Valued Sedan  My wife and I just bought a 2013 Hyundai Azera after coming from a Nissan dealer, test driving their Maxima. We are old Nissan owners and have owned two Altimas, two Maximas, and two Infinity G35's. This new Azera reminds us of the Infinity G35 Sport Sedan we bought in 2004, except it has many more features. The Bluetooth and stereo are awesome. The interior room and the leather seating are great. We highly recommend this car to anyone who wants a great sedan at a great price that is comparable to a Lexus or BMW or Cadillac."
"From a practical enthusiast...   I have no desire to race my car from stoplight to stoplight.I have no desire to zip thru canyons as fast as possible.I DO like to have ample power for typical driving situations (highway passing, merging, etc.).I DO appreciate a car that handles well.This car delivers on all fronts.Typically, I drive the speed limit +5mph in the city, and +8 to 10mph on the highway. Driving I-10 to LA westbound (against the wind) at an average of 80mph I observe 25 to 27mpg.Eastbound (with the wind) I see 29 to 30.Practical mileage with ample power, luxury, and incredible sound system to boot.Love this car.Side note: big guy 6'2"", long legs, 250lbs and completely comfortable for long trips."
"...it's a SLEEPER folks!  Wife purchased this car because ""it's sexy, looks like a Lexus, has more features than a Lexus, costs thousands less, has twice the warranty and offers a panoramic roof!"".. Ok, can't argue with that.So with that she drove home a 2013 Hyper Silver with Black interior Azera with the optional ""Tech Package"" which gave her the HD Nav screen, Pano roof, heated/cooled seats, 550W Infinity sound system and a list of other features.I do have to say that I'm impressed!I've owned/driven 5-7 Series BMW's, Lexus ES, Toyota Avalon, Cadillacs and this car is truely amazing for the money.I can't believe they don't sell more of them.Quiet, smooth, enough power and SAFE - 9 Airbags including knees!"
"Probably Best in Class  In a class that includes cars such as the Toyota Avalon, Nissan Maxima, and Buick LaCrosse, the Azera is probably the best. I leased a 2013 Azera with Tech in Feb and have put about 2,500 miles on the car so far.The car is amazing, especially compared to the 2011 Sonata GLS base model I upgraded from. The base model Azera comes standard with features that you have to get pricey options packages on the competitors in order to have. The Tech package adds a lot of cool features as well. This car is very nice to drive and it stands out visually when placed next to its competitors. There aren't very many Azeras on the road so it is also relatively unique."
"Great Car for the Money  As a longtime Infiniti driver, my friends gave me quite a hard time when I traded my Infiniti M35X for a 2013 Hyundai Azera with the technology package. Let them laugh as I laugh all the way to the bank. This is a luxury car in everything but name and price. For well under $40K I got a better ride, more features and much better fuel economy than the Infiniti I traded in. I test drove quite a few cars including Audis and BMWs but based on content and build quality I just couldn't justify $20 to $30K more for a name. Engine is smooth and responsive and the leather is as butter soft as in any other ""Luxury"" car that I could actually afford."
love this car!  I was looking tired get a new car and get out of my '09 Accord EXL V6. I test drove the new accord touring model and then the Azera. I had already fell in love with the looks of the Azera. But after driving it I was sold! While the new accord was much improved over the previous model the azera had all the creature features I wanted. I'm 6'1 and this car is very roomy.
"Just bought a 2013 Azera  Unbelievable value for the money.Love driving it, great bluetooth for phone and easy to use navigation. Comfortable leather seats, seats 5 confortably including tall adults in the back.Wish the steering wheel could come out a little but more (an extra inch would have been nice)Overal, great buy, great MPG with potent V6. "
Our fourth new Hyundai-all have been excellent  Higher performance than looks would indicate. Gas mileage not its strong point but OK given engine performance
"Hyundai Hidden Engine Failures Bit Me  There is no reason for my 2011 Azera with 42,200 miles on it should have a  #3 connecting rod bearing fail.  I believe Hyundai in their ads wants people to believe that the early disasters that were called cars by  Hyundai and sold in the US in the 1980 mistakes of the past and they build a quality product now and their 10 year warranty on their 3.8 L V6 was evidence Hyndai engines were quality prducts.  WRONG!  It is a fact that no late model car of any manufacturer sold in the US should experience connecting rod bearing failure at 42,200 miles! Modern oils and bearing materials allow properly designed and built engines to run over 100,000 miles with no engine bearing problems.   I have been driving since 1954 and at no time since then have I experienced or known of anyone having engine bearing failures - that is until I bought my 2011 Azera in January, 2014.  It was a like new used vehicle,  with 30,000 miles on odometer, bought from a local Hyundai dealer, and was in great shape, under the remaining Hyundai warranty,  and properly maintained using synthetic oil  for the 12,200 miles I drove it.  In December, 2017  I experienced the rod bearing failure and  contacted Hyundai about a goodwill warranty coverage because engine bearing failures in modern cars just don't happen!  But Hyundai  turned me down!  So be advised, Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, and Subaru may have shorter warranties but they also have engines that don't self destruct in 42,200 miles of use either.  Save yourself grief and big bucks fixing Hyundai's mistakes by avoiding any and all Hyundai vehicles.  You know Hyundai,  -  the Company I believe that sells  cars with V6  engines so poorly designed and made that they self destruct around 42,200 miles.  And I think they know what I say is the truth!"
"FUN TO DRIVE/. Update 8/2018  I bought this new in 2014 as a retirement gift to myself.  I have had a lower back fusion and cervical fusion.   This car was easy to get in and the leather seats were comfortable and were heated if needed.  I loved the look of the  66 Mustang so the retro look was perfect and it  was changing in 2015.  A Convertible is the only way to go and the V8 was to costly.  There are so many aftermarket  goodies you can really make it your own!  Gas mileage is disappointing if your heavy on city driving.  It is fast. The select shift gives you a fun feeling of a manual transmission and really makes it quick and fast!  The 2.73 auto transmission is a bit sluggish, so if you can find a performance package it will take care of that.   My water pump went out around 30k miles but the warrant covered it.   The Synch Bluetooth system can be sensitive but with time you will learn the do's and don'ts.  It takes regular unleaded gas, looks sharp and is se"

"Most overlooked car in the US market  I had never heard of the Azera until a friend of mine with a Genesis let me drive it. I was impressed and went to the dealer to check them out, but the one thing I didn't like was RWD--thus a test drive of the Azera. It was the last of seven cars I test-drove and turned out to be just what I wanted & thousands of dollars less than I was willing to pay. All the cars I drove were either German or Japanese. My second choice was the Avalon, but didn't think it met my needs like the Azera. My Azera now has over 1000 miles on it & am truly amazed at the quality for the price. It's not often the least expensive is my favorite. It is a far superior car to the Buick I used to drive."
"My best car  My last cars before my azeras were Jaguar & Lexus. I just traded my 2009 azera limited for 2011 limited. I liked the 2009 so much that I wanted another. The 2011 is even smoother & faster with the 6 speed transmission. The trade in value was excellent & I am very happy. This is more of an automobile than the jag & Lexus could hope to be, and for thousands less. I test drove the sonata & Genesis. The sonata was too small & the Genesis is not as smooth & comfortable as the azera. The azera is just the finest car I have ever owned. "
"Great car  Had a 2006 new azera and loved it. traded it in at 40,000 miles for the 2011. and i love the 2011 even better. took a 160 mile trip and averaged 30.2 miles per gallon. i have the nav. package and xm Sirius radio. everything is working beautiful. I'm just surprised there aren't more being sold. i must admit i came close to buying the 2011 sonata but went back to the azera and am not sorry although the sonata was just as beautiful. "
"Nice car!  Just bought this car.  Haven't driven much yet, but so far, we love it!  It is very stylish, and I like that I haven't seen another on the road.  Roomy, fun to drive.  Lots of pick- up.  Mine is loaded, so all the gadgets are very neat, especially the pop up rear window shade!"
As Good as a Genesis  This car is better than a German and much less expensive with a superior warranty.  Very elegant.
Great value!!  Simply the best car I've ever owned.Cannot understand its lack of popularity with the public. Extremely reliable and not overly pricey for Hyundai's top of the line (at the time) model.
"Going to 300K....CURRENTLY 215,000  I have had an unbelievable experience with this car----did regular maintenance only------215,000 with only front axles replaced ($600).  Car still drives/rides great...little mushy but am replacing shocks struts soon.  This was a former rental car when I bought it w/19K on 6/09.  Long distance driving is GREAT (Charlotte-Boston three times; Char-Chicago twice; Charlotte-Raleigh sixty times; Raleigh-Atlanta 6 times).  I ""feathered"" my  gas pedal, drove 70-75mph from Raleigh to Charlotte and got 33 mpg----WOW.  The engine is simply awesome for power. Sound system great; seat, gas pedal personalization is great.  Big trunk, backseat and much much lower price than Lexus.  Love this car...."
"Low cost luxury  Hyundai Azera has a good value in regards to comfort and ride.But not so good on the brakes,fuel economy and resale value that should."
"Where are these!  I have been interested in the Hyundai Azera's for a while and finally found a good price on a used one.With 78,000 miles on it I still cant believe how well it looks and drives.What really surprises me is how little these gems sold in America.For the money I don't believe there was a better buy in this class.All cars have issues and for what you pay for this car, and the amenities you receive it is amazing.Ican't wait to buy one of these brand new some day.Great job Hyundai and Kia!!!!!"
"Love the Car... but  Good:  Fun to drive.  Love the electronics.  Love the Handling.  Good gas mileage.  Great classic look.  I'm 6' 4"" and although the car is snug, it is comfortable.                    Bad:   Although the engine has loads of power, the automatic transmission is worthless.  Takes at least a full second to downshift or upshift when accelerating.  Also, the car is electronically limited to 110 mph.  I've read this is because the driveshaft will fail at higher speeds. Have had two problems with the car.  Had an oil leak at the input shaft to the rear axle.  Also had a check engine light for a bad valve in the EVAP system.  Both repaired under extended warranty."
"Excellent Car  A few month ago I have bought a used 2008 Hyundai Azera Limited (Canadian Edition) with 68,000km. Since then, I have driven about 10,000km and managed to get a consistent/avarage 28MPG (25MPG city and 30MPG highway). The car looks good, fun to drive, comfortable and no reliability problems whatsoever. I have purchased an aftermarket DVD/GPS unit with rear view camera to replace the factory radio, so now the vehicle is complete."
"The Azera is a great family car!  Purchased used in 2009 w/17,000 miles. It has been very good with no maintenance issues. I wanted a Toyota Avalon but they cost thousands more for the same car. Also chose this vehicle because we have had such good luck with our Hyundai Sonata. Everyone that rides in it loves our car. This is a nice luxury vehicle with great features that is very affordable. Hyundai has a great warranty & they have always been very good to deal with, we will buy another Hyundai next time-possibly a Genesis."
"Still the best value in the land  Still the best value.  Bought my Azera only six months ago and already put 12,000 miles on it.  It's a dream.  What a value for the bucks (less than $20K).  And I always get looks and comments.  Minor annoyances: driver's seat doesn't go back far enough; bumps are over exaggerated.  But all in all it's more than likely the best car I've ever owned (and I've owned about 15).  Nothing to think about.  If you're looking for a great car at a great price - Azera's your only real choice.  I'm even thinking about getting another one.  "
"Replaced Michelins with Bridgestones  OEM Michelins with lots of rubber were driving me nuts with their noise.  Replaced them with Bridgestone Turanzas Serenity.  Holy Crapola!  What an upgrade in so many ways; it drives like a new car.  No more noise and hippity hopping down the bunny trail anymore. And the car drives like it is on a track, unbelievable.  Got the tires out the door for $400.  Great deal; great tire; finally great handling and cruising and silence - blessed silence.  Those Michelins were driving my buggy.  Those are the only Michelins I have ever had on a car and they will be the only ones.  SemperFi"
"Excessive road noise inside  I've had my 2008 Azera for 9 months, and have noticed the road noise inside the car to be very loud, compared to the 2006 Azera I still own, and my wife drives. I have adjusted the tire pressure on the Michelin tires, and still see no improvement. Both cars have the exact same tires, and maintain the same tire pressure. The dealer says ""it is what it is"", and couldn't explain why both cars would vary so much in road noise. I still have 1000's of miles wear left on these tires, and hope when the time comes to replace them, it will make a difference"
"Poor Quailty vehicle no care fromHyundai  Guess the frustration is everything gone wrong seems to not be able to be repaired or not covered under Hyundai warranty. In 2 years CD has gone out, not under warranty, head gasket blew, not has a battery discharge short they cannot find and been in shop for 4 times same issue for a month. Hyundai won't return calls to me to discuss the issue and shop says they know it has a problem but don't know how to repair. While I enjoyed this car at once as a company I now have to give Hyundai an ""F"" for consumer assistance and standing behind their product. They are not a brand on my do not buy list for any reason."
"Best Car I Have Owned  This is our 5th Hyundai and they just get better each time.  Great car to drive back and forth to work everyday (50 miles so comfort and safety are paramount).  The leather interior is luxurious and the wood trim gives a sense of elegance and opulence in an otherwise very affordable car. Such a smooth comfy ride, reminds me of my Mother's 1978 Cadillac El Dorado."
"Been there Done that  Looked at Hyundai in 1986 and didn't buy. Had 2001 Audi A6 which I sold and wanted to replace with a newer model. Drove a Sonata on a dare and enjoyed it but wanted a more powerful luxury car similar to my Audi Quattro which was the best handling car I've ever owned. The Azera that I bought was $6,000 less and 2 years newer than a comparable A6. Mileage at steady 80 is 22 mpg at 53 mph was an astonishing 29 mpg. Very comfortable ride, excellent handling for a FWD full size sedan. The dealer in Delray Beach treats me like gold and has replaced shocks, turned rotors above 30k miles. I've driven all types of cars in my over 40 years and this has to be one of the best. Definitely will buy again."
"Own a 2006 & 2008 azera  Bought a used 2006 (1st year model) limited edition, with 12,000 miles. Now has 103,000. Gave it to my wife, when I bought a used 2008 azera with 12,000 miles, now has 30,000. I have owned over 25 cars in my life, and these are among my top 3 all time favorite cars. You can't beat the quality and features for the price. Dealer service is the only way to go. They stand behind their cars 100%. If I have to complain about something, its the amount of road noise on the freeway. My 2008 has navigation, but it is outdated, and not user friendly. Hyundai is updating the nav in 2011. Two friends have bought azera's, after driving mine. "
"Long-Term Update  This is a long-term update to my earlier report about 16 months ago when the car had about 20,000 miles. I now have about 60,000 miles on the car and I still love it. No question that this is one of the best cars - definitely the best value - I have ever owned. I have only had only one unusual problem - had a broken tooth on the timing gear, it was replaced under warranty. Otherwise it has been perfectly reliable. As you can tell, I spend a lot of time in a car covering al-ms in technology sales. I often will drive over 3 hours in a stretch and I arrive still feeling good as the car is so comfortable. "
"Love my Stang  Wanted a ""newer"" mustang for quite a while.  Found the perfect car for me.  Right color, deep impact blue, convertible a lot of bells and whistles.  Price was very good for a low mileage, spotless car."
"I'd look at a Sonata  I own a Sonata.  Mine went in to the shop for a recall and I got a 2008 Azera with 20k miles on the odo. It rattles like crazy and you hear the back end. The transmission is terrible and doesn't shift right. There is cheap plastic and door handles are plastic. My Sonata is so much nicer and roomier. I don't understand. Was looking forward to driving this car. Like Hyundai, but I would look at a Sonata.  Mine has twice the miles and no rattles.  Oh, turned the radio up so I couldn't hear the rattles and the Infinity radio is pretty bad too.  This one pulls to the right, maybe it's been wrecked since its a loaner car?"
"Best Car I've ever owned  Previously owned a Pontiac Bonneville, didn't ever think I would find a car as comfy as my Bonneville, but this car has surpassed it in the Comfort Zone! I test drove 7 different cars before I drove this car, and it was by far the best!! The steering is so precise you feel like it's doing all the work for you! The power side view mirrors the heated seats with lumbar support for the driver and passenger, the adjustable pedals, the auto settings for the mechanical steering wheel for 2 different drivers,the back seat has great leg room, I just can't say enough about how much we are enjoying this car!! This is definitely a Luxury Car!!"
"Unhappy Owner  I bought this car used Aug 09. Had 28k miles on it. It has developed a quite load ticking in the engine. Worse on cold days but can be heard always. Tried twice to get dealer to fix under warranty. They refused. Said until something breaks there's nothing they can do. What good is a warranty if they won't honer it. I actually am starting to hate this car.  Its has a noisy, jittery ride. I just have a feeling in another 20k it will be a hunk of junk. I will get rid of it somehow this summer when it warms up and the ticking sound is not a obvious."
"Very Happy  I bought an '08 Azera Limited yesterday so this is my initial review.  I'm very impressed with the car's ride, overall quality and appearance.  I bought it with 16,500 miles.  I paid $17K + my 2002 Sonata that was essentially a write off.  I'm very happy with the deal I made.  $17K for a $30K+ car is awesome.  It's comfortable, SAFE and classy.  I don't see any reason to pay the premium for other brands.  This is my 3rd Hyundai and there probably will be a 4th."
"Very Good but no Great  This is my first Hyundai. I had done loads of research before purchasing this car. I've been a Toyota man for 20+ years and it was difficult to change brands. The low resale value of this cars helped me to purchase the Hyundai. I'm not sure if I regret this decision or not, but, time will tell. I don't believe it is the same quality as Toyota, but, it's close in many areas. The performance is excellent, gas mileage is very good for 263 hp. Seating comfort is a little lacking due to very short seat bottoms. Many many lxury features, but, they haven't changed much at all since 2006. Needs a major updating."
"Disappointed - Not for Everyone!!!  1) After first week, I felt the car pulling ...took to the dealer and they aligned it. 2nd wk still pulling...took back to the dealer and they found that the left front tire was defective and replaced for free... 2) After ~13K miles vibration upon applying brake...dealer stated that rotors needed to be ""turned""...I was outside of 12K miles for what Hyundai calls ""adjustments"" and so had to pay 3) Dashboard cracked - KNOWN PROB WITH AZERAS- this was what was stated by dealer-My car is garaged and was so very disappointed/frustrated that yet another prob-replaced under warranty 4) Loud noise in Engine. Dlr ran diagnostics & checked front end.Could find nothing wrong...hoping nothing awaits me next"
"SURPRISING  I was in the market for a 5 series BMW and decided to a take a friends advice and check out the Hyundai Azera. Very glad I did, it has all the features of the BMW with extras such as folding mirrors, telescoping pedals and steering wheel. The entry and exit from the vehicle was also easier than the 5 series bmw body. The HP on the Azera is surpasses the BMW 525 as well. Warranty was also much better. 6yrs/60K compared to the 4yrs/50K BMW. The Azera is very stable at hugs the road well on turns. OVer all very pleased. "
Very Pleased Azera Owner  This car will not disappoint you.  It offers many luxurious features at a fraction of the price in comparison to Lexus.  It is truly a pleasure to drive.  It is equipped with ample power for safe passing and responds well on hills and navigating turns. I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a car with style and grace - it more than measures up to Lexus or BMW. 
"Dont Believe the Hype  After 6000 miles, I have had several problems, mostly electrical. The air bags were broken 1 week after purchase, and my driver seat moves backwards while driving. The finish of the dashboard is separating around the airbag housing. The car drives well, but I fear that it will be falling apart in a few years. After this experience, probably wont buy another Hyundai."
"Don't look any further!!!!!  This is my third Hyundai, my two others were Sonata's. I loved both of those but after upgrading to the Azera this is by far more bang for the buck than BMW,Lexus or any other high end car this size. I'm getting 28-30 mpg on rural roads at 45-50 mph and 32-36 highway at 70mph.Powerful 3.8 ltr and great mileage to boot! Try and find one coming off lease and save big$$$$$."
"Love my Stang  Wanted a ""newer"" mustang for quite a while.  Found the perfect car for me.  Right color, deep impact blue, convertible a lot of bells and whistles.  Price was very good for a low mileage, spotless car."
"WOW What a Car  Have had Taurus's since 1986. Went to look at a new Sonata and saw this used 08 Azera. We fell in love and a short test drive was all we needed. I've driven BMW's, a Lexus and this is right at the top with them, only less expensive. We can't say enough about the car. Ride is smooth and quiet. XM Radio and stereo system is top notch. Power fold mirrors are the cats meow. Driver 1 and 2 position seting should be on all cars. So many features We are very impressed. If you are looking for a car and a value for your money you should drive one of these and purchase it. Oh, by the way.... The wife hardly lets husband drive it......it's hers."
"shoot this car  I loved this car for the first two months. Since then I have had nothing but problems.  So many rattles and clicking noises.  I hate this car now. I have had it in the shop so many times I have lost count. I am sick and tired of the dealership telling me the car is fixed and then driving it home, the same noise occurs.  I am ready to shoot it and put it and me out of misery."
"One Helluva Car  I never, never ever thought that I would buy a Hyundai.  But, I did.  And I am forever so glad.  I have owned over 40 cars including Lincoln, Lexus, Buick, Lancia, Karmin Ghia, Oldsmobile, Ford, Volvo, etc.; and by far this 08 Hyundai Azera drives circles around all of them.  I traded an 07 Buick Lucerne CXS after only 9 months of shear frustration with all of the problems including a bad vibration whenever the engine was doing 1500 rpms regardless of the speed of the car.  And the turning radius was horrendous.  And you could not see the instrument in the daytime.  And the front seat belts were nonfunctional (would not lock up).  And on and on and on.  This Azera was an answer to my prayers"
Nice car for a nice price  Purchased used from dealer (executive car with only 22K miles) It was extremely well taken care of and looks and drives brand new...still smells new!  It now has almost 30K and I'm still pleased with it; plan to keep it a long time.  I get lots of compliments and now that I have one I'm starting to notice them on the road more.  You can't beat it for the price...however the Genesis is very tempting.
"dont buy an azera  I bought a 2008 azera on june 1st of 2009. It was a program car and had 8,400 miles on it.  It cost a little less than a camry, and had a better warranty, but that's the only good part. It in no way matches the quality of a toyota camry. I've read these reviews and have decided that they must have been written by hundai dealers.  My overall gas mileage is around 18 mpg. I guess that's good if you compare it with a hummer. I took the car on vacation and the throttle sensor went out 22 times before i could get it to a dealership to fix it. The mechanic who fixed it said that he had fixed several of them, and he didn't know why they didn't have a recall on them. I'm very disappointed in the car."
"AUTOMOTIVE EXCELLENCE  Traded an 07 Buick Lucerne CXS in on this Azera about a month ago.  I had been researching and test driving earlier versions of it.  Traded it in on an 08 Azera Limited with the Ultimate Package.   The Azera is a driver's car; it performs and handles excellently.  I have added mp3 (wireless) and a lip spoiler, etc.  Gangbusters.  SemperFi"
"Best Value  Purchased used (rental) with 13,500 miles at more than $8,000 less than a new '09.  I looked at all options in the mid-size/full size (new & used) and settled on the Azera when several became available from the rental fleets. Traded a 2005 Maxima.  I use for business (sales) and needed something that was safe and comfortable.  The Azera wins hands down! I have averaged around 25 mpg (75 highway/ 25 city) and find the freeway drive exceptional.  Trunk & rear seat offer plenty of room.  Ride in the city is a little sloppy compared to the Maxima.  "
"Purchased Used and Thrilled   Purchased used with 17,000 miles. avg about 25 MPG in mixed (mostly Hwy).  Very comfortable. Great car!  We will probably purchase another.  We know a lot of tall people"
"No Better Near-Luxury Car for the Price  I traded a 2006 Sonata GLS 4-cyl for this car.  I was also looking at a 2009 Sonata 4-cyl Limited.  After driving the Azera, there was no comparison.  I got the Azera with 15k on it for $1,000 less than the Sonata Limited would have been; even after $4,500 in rebates.  The Azera is a solid car with a quiet ride.  Only over certain types of broken pavement could the suspension be a little more supple.  The 3.8 liter engine is very quiet and goes almost unheard up until 4,500 rpm.  The engine is very strong throughout the powerband.  The 5-speed auto is smooth, though shifts could be a bit more swift.  The gas mileage averages only 2-3 MPG less than my Sonata 4-cyl."
"a good car but not up to luxury quality  I have only 10,500 miles on this car I find it Nice to drive but not up to the standards I was expecting.  The gas mileage is disappointing but does fall within Hyundai's spec when using gasoline without ethanol which lowers the mileage by around 3.5 mpg. I find the wind noise a little excessive. Handling is great it is hard to clean the paint.  I have problem with slight shake while car is cold goes away as soon as engine warms.  The am radio has very very limited reception dealer says this is normal. Overall I find the car not worth the price.  I have driven many cars many thousand miles  I rate this one average. Walter"
"after years finally replaced bad airbags  safe to drive now, after 2 years air bag replaced. Took years to replace un safe air bags, dealer until bags were replaced offered me next to nothing for it. The first thing I did after car was fixed was to trade it off."
Anyone else have this issue??  All features work well and car handles well.  I now have about 13K miles on the car and the front rotors already show signs of wear.  The dealer indicated that this was due to the hardness of the brake shoes.  It would look as though the rotors would already need to be turned.  Has anyone else had this issue?  Gas mileage is less than impressive.
"A LOT of Car for the Money  I have 20,000 miles on my 2008 azera limited.  This is a lot of car for the money!  It is quiet, smooth, comfortable and with great performance from the 3.8l v-6.  It has been perfectly reliable.  There are no rattles or squeaks anywhere and it feels like it will stay that way forever.  My children love the back seat - comfortable seats with lots of room.  The truck is huge!   All of the controls are logically laid out and I did not have to go to school to figure everything out.   I Cruise at 72 - 78 on the interstate and the car is stable, quiet, great visibility all around and I average 25 - 26 mpg at this speed.   I love the styling, it is understated, but classic."
"Bang for the Buck  I needed a quiet, comfortable car that I take on long trips.  I looked at luxury models including Lexus and Mercedes. For about $15K less, the Azera compares favorably.  It's smooth and powerful, and most importantly, quiet.  Gas mileage is decent--about 21-22 around town and 27 on the highway.  Quality is outstanding.  And the engine is responsive and powerful."
"Just WONDERFUL!!  I (like others) went to get a Sonata. I'd researched the vehicle thoroughly and found it to be just what I wanted. I climbed in and thought it fine, but my girlfriend thought it looked a little small. the salesman then took us on a test drive of the Azera and it was love at first drive. The ride, comfort and extras teat come in the Lilmited edition put the car right up against the stiffest competition. I cannot say enough good things about the car."
"Love This Vehicle  Great value.  I'm not sure why, but I was able to buy this vehicle for about $3,000 below dealer cost.  I've never driven a new car off the lot and have the ability to go trade it in for a profit.  That aside, what a find.  Great power, smooth ride, awesome sound system, sunroof, navigation.  My wife drives a BMW X3 and I prefer to drive this vehicle.  That pretty much sums it up."
"High Quality Car  I bought my 2008 Hyundai Azera in June of 2008.  And so far with about a month and a half of driving the car, I still enjoy the ride and its features.  It took me a while to find out all the features it had. The ride is smooth and the comfort is great with leather seats.  I really enjoy the LG Navigation system, this way I won't get lost anymore.  There were a number of reviews I read before and after buying the car, and overall they speak well of the car, however they point a little about the steering.  I find the handling and steering to be fine. I guess the only thing I could complain about is that there are a few squeaks and rattles from the car when going over bumps, which is annoying."
"best deal  I spent a lot of time on line researching the purchase of a second car. Hyundai warranty is very persuasive. Had all the intentions of getting a 09 sonata limited with the navigation option. After a very satisfying demo of the sonata, I made the mistake of sitting in a 2008 leftover azera. This car wowed me right away. After some negotiating, I was able to purchase the azera limited, with the ultimate nav. Option for an "" out the door "" price of $27,500. This made it about $2,500 more than the sonata, and it is very well worth it. It is a beautiful ride, and you really need nothing more."
"What a great car!!  We went to the Hyundai dealership to look at the Sonata and while it is a great car, was not big enough for our family. We the looked at the Azera and drove it. We found that the car drove and ran excellent. More power than the Sonata, and my 6'1"" son can sit behind me in the back seat and still have leg room. The car rides excellent, looks great, and gets decent gas milage, considering it's size and horsepower output. At many thousands of dollars less than the competition, this car sticks out as an EXCELLENT alternative. The warranty doesn't hurt anything either! "
"Great Rental - might consider buying  An excellent car.  We rented the Azera for a trip around the Northwest. I was initially skeptical about having a Hyundai (even with only 7 miles on it), but that wore off immediately.  We could fit 5 suitcases, a full size stroller (folded) in the trunk and two kids in the back seat comfortably.  Our round trip was from Portland, around the Olympic Peninsula, to Seattle and back to Portland.  Whether cruising on 101 or climbing mountain roads to over 5000 feet, the Azera gave a smooth, comfortable, and powerful ride.  MPG was quite reasonable for a full size car."
"08 Azera  I love the car.  Drives really smoothly, and has great acceleration. All the safety features are great, because I pick up my kids from school, so now I can feel more comfortable knowing that they are more protected. Looked at the Avalon, maxima, acura tl, and merc. C300 series. For the price I got the most with the azera and I have the safety net of the 10 year warranty. Definitely give it a test drive and it will be on your short list as well. "
"RECALL**ALL Mustang Airbags could kill if deployed  Ford informed all Mustang (and potentially other makes and models) owners in June 2015 that the airbags need to be replaced. Since, I have been calling to see where they are at on this situation as I do not want my children in the car, let alone myself, where the very function that is supposed to help you in an accident, ""could result in serious injury or death"" (as stated directly in the 2nd recall letter I received last week. I called Fords service division to discuss what they will be doing for their customers, and they said nothing but simply having us ""wait another 6 months for the part to slowly come in."" As the service lady stated on the phone to me. I think this is very irresponsible on Ford's part. Having their customers drive around a car that could put them at greater risk in an accident than the very accident itself. I feel it is unfair as a customer to be forced to drive under these conditions, or choose to sell or leave the car in the garage knowing the risks of driving it. Ford should allow customers who bought cars to return them or provide us with safer vehicles in the meantime until these issues are fixed."
best  I get so many people that look at my car. I get mileage in the high 20s. And now they have the option of the navigation. And its great. Love the wood and the power folding mirrors and the rain sensing wipers. I also like the seat memory for the mirrors and sterring wheel. And the sunshade in the back is great. Best price for this much stuff.
"Azera is a Good Automobile  I have driven my new Azera for 3 weeks. So far,I love it. Powerful,smooth,noiseless ride. I wanted the white ,But not in stock. I purchased the Titanium Blue. How lucky was I??? The blue is soooo rich looking. To own a car for 10-20000 dollars less than I was expecting to pay is a huge bonus. Hyundai makes a fine product. I ...Will write a comment in about 6 months,after the break in period. "
"Great car so far  This will be my third Hyundai. We have come up the line from elantra,sonata and now the azera. This is an excellent riding vehicle. Very quiet. There is some road noise but I'm attributing that to the tires. Not a lot of people who rated this car like the michelin mxv4 plus tires. I will be taking them off. It handles well,great pickup from the engine. Very,very roomy. Great trunk space. The basic stereo system could use more power. The XM portion doesn't come through very loud. The steering wheel volume control are kind of hidden. Still these are minor problems that wouldn't stop me from buying another azera. It shouldn't stop you either. Take one for a spin. "
great ride!  I'm 23 and I like my 08 azera. It is a nice pearl white but very hard to keep clean. I like the power of the 3.3 liter 234 hp engine. Spins its tires easily. Love shiftronic is good for redlining it.0-60(timed myself) is 7.8 seconds. Ugly alloy wheels.
"Luxury for Less  The 2008 Azera Limited (with the Ultimate  Package)is one fine automobile.  You can own an excellent, reliable, comfortable, powerful and safe auto for thousands less than the other ""driveway dressing"" brands. You'll turn some heads (and leave them at the starting line)in your Azzie.  It has so many upscale refinements. Very well designed and the mechanicals (transmission and engine performance) behave like a refined auto costing much more. Quiet, comfortable cabin. And a great warranty. If you're looking for a great car at a great price, check out the Azera.  Do your homework, give it a drive and you'll see...big bang for your hard-earned buck. "
great  This car has power for a 3.3 liter 234 hp engine. It pulls very easy and easy to spin its tires. Got 2 speeding tickets on a freeway going 110mph because it is so quiet in the car. Love pearl white paint and beige inside. My dad wasn't too pleased that i got this because he knows that i would fly in it. Wheels could be bigger. Never thought i would want a Hyundai.
"Awesome Family Hauler  We were lucky to find this van with low miles at a great price!  We've taken it on 3 long road trips and each time we return we're even happier with the van. It's roomy and very comfortable to drive.  This van has a ton of power!  Great for passing and for high speed driving.  Our only complaints have been the steering wheel shakes at higher speeds and there is a bit of a clatter when it's first started, especially on cold days.  Also having a difficult time keeping it aligned, always pulls a little to one side even right after new tires and alignment.  You can drive this van all day at 90mph and it's perfectly content, doesn't feel like it's even working hard.  The van also corners very well, feels very stable on corners.  It's easy to remove the middle row seats and the rear seats go right into the floor.  Great van!"
Creature Comfort  Great overall minivan.
"My Second Entourage!  I purchased an '07 Entourage after having a Dodge Caravan. Light years better! I use the vans for my dog grooming business (pick up/deliveries) so my vans are worked hard. I put about 30k miles annually, all city traffic. My '07 now has 140k miles and still going. I'm sorry Hyundai discontinued this model. The '16 KIA Sodona received bad reviews so I just purchased a used '08 Entourage with 41k mikes. I anticipate the same amazing quality and reliability! I love these vans. Great pick up on them too!"
"Stay away from hyundai entourage..run and never lo  This car has a defect with the starter and wiring..something defective with the antitheft system. You will regret buying so don't. We paid 11,000 and asked to trade in a month later offered 3,000 by the same joke of a dealership. Van randomly does not start. Ongoing issue since purchase. Key Hyundai service dept has been totally useless. Sales dept was not honest and upfront about the vehicle's issues. DO NOT expensive mistake our family made."
Drive It Like I Stole It  I got back into the Mustang as a retiree and do not regret it. It is a fun car to drive and fulfills all my needs as a daily driver. Ya gotta love the V8 using regular-gas. It is also easily personalized and that is what I am in the process of doing.
"My ""Gotta Have It Green"" Dream  I have always been a Mustang fan, and this 2014 model is as close to perfect for me as I could get. I purchased this convertible with 32,000 miles on it and have since put about 20,000 miles on it. It is very difficult for me to let it stand still in the garage. I love driving this car so much. I have driven a pick up, an economy car, luxury car and German sports car, and the Mustang is the best road handling of the bunch. The acceleration is incredible, the braking is strong, and the fuel economy averages about 23-24 in town. Driving with the top down brings you much closer to nature especially living in a place like Central Florida. It can get super hot outside, but it is difficult or me to not want to put the top down. This car definitely draws the looks of passers by and the admiration of others who have not realized their dream of Mustang ownership. So far, I have not had any mechanical issues to attend to. I purchased a Ford Factory Extended Warranty and so far it has gone unused."
"I wish they would build the Hyundai Entourage again!!  I LOVE this van!!!  I have almost 230K miles on it and I have loved every minute, every mile.  I really wish Hyundai would build it again.  I know someday I will have to replace it, but if history is any indicator, it won't be soon.  So, Hyundai, you have time to re-tool and build me a new one!  Go for it!!   Please!!!"
wonderful van  I've had my van for 5 yes I still love like it was the first day I got it I didn't really want a van but the family needed one and I'm so glad we did. I can fit 7 comfortably and it drives so nice. It doesn't feel like I'm stuck driving a van.the kids live the DVD and I love the sliding doors!
"A great Van!  I have over 84,000 miles on the van, and it is a vary dependable van.I go everywhere with it, and I mean everywhere. I plan on keeping itas long as I can.Everything works great. I chose the Entourage over, Dodge, Chevy, ford,etc."
"2007 entourage 04 SANTA FE  I HAVE 2 HYUNDAIS AN 04 SANTS FE W107K LX MODEL AND IT STILLS RUNS ALMOST LIKE NEW GREAT CAR. THIS IS WHY I TRIED THE 07 ENTOURAGE; IT NOW HAS 95K AND STILL RUNS GREAT. I NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS W/ EITHER CAR AND I'M IN THE MARKET FOR THE 11 SONOTA HYBRID.EVERYONE LAUGHED NOW WHO IS LAUGHING THEY MAKE ""GREAT CARS"" JUST LOOK AT THEIR LINEUP OF MODLES. AS FOR THE ENTOURAGE AS U CAN C BY THE MILAGE WE DRIVE THIS CAR. IT BEEN TO FLA 4X, HILTON HEAD5X AND VARIOUS PLACES. ON THE HIGHWAY 75MPH ISOUR AVERAGE AND WE GET 20+MPG WHICH IS GOOD W/ A FULL CAR WHICH IS 4600LBS. THERE ISN'T ONE THING I WOULD CHANGE, W/THE EXCEPTION OF HAVING A SUN ROOF LIKE I HAVE ON THE SANTA FE. "
"Best value in Vans  I bought my Entourage in 2007 after comparing it to the Dodge, Chrysler, Honda, and Toyota offerings.I had a 1990 Dodge minivan for 19 years and it still had more zip, and better handling than the Dodge and Chrysler vans.The Entourage has great road feel, plenty of zip, was nicely appointed and was $7,000 cheaper than other comparable models.The seat felt better than those in other vans and that was important because I have back problems and must do long drives.The only problems I have had in five years is a buzz in the AM reception that I attribute to had tuning, because FM comes in clear.The other problem is the passenger grab bar that came out when a passenger exited.I replaced the two small metal screws and have not had a problem since.Resale value is a problem for those who trade every few years.I keep my vehicles for ten to fifteen years and when I get ready to buy another Hyundai will be at the top of the list."
"LEMON LEMON LEMON  Where to start I dont normally write to forums, however I feel obligated to warn people of this vehicle. LEMON LEMON LEMON I first owned a 2004 Sonata amazing car, loved it, no problems whatsoever. So when we had our second child, I decided to invest (bad choice of words) in something larger. Test drove all the typical minivans, Dodge, Toyota, Honda but my bias of Hyundai led me to chose the Entourage. What a mistake. Heres a list of problems since Ive owned it: 1. Had to replace the DVD player within a couple weeks of purchase2. Had to fix broken arm rest3. Had to replace rotors twice and entire breaks once, not related to driving but defects4. The key ignition had to be replaced, had to get towed for this one. Happened at a movie threatre, we had a baby sitter at home, had to get a rental for 4 days until it was fixed they didnt cover the rental.5. There has been ongoing battery / wiring (unknown) issues. It is currently in the garage for a 3rd battery replacement. Approx every year the battery dies completely and wont hold a charge anymore. Last years fix was a computer s/w upgrade yeah right. Today they are saying it is a module recall for the side doors that they think is the problem yeah right and whatever happened to informing customers of recalls. I have a 2nd small car, 97 Toyota Tercel with 200,000 KM that I trust more than this vehicle.6. I also have an ongoing headlight issue. When I break or when the gears shift, there is a noticeable dimming (1 or 2 sec) of the headlights. I think it is related to problem number 5.7. Yes the powered side doors are great when or if they work. Someone told me when I first bought the van, having everything powered is just more to go wrong how true. I live in Canada, any amount of snow or frost; the side doors are impossible to open. This vehicle was to be our long-term family car. I wish this info was available before I bought. Avoid this vehicle or suffer the consequences. LEMON LEMON LEMON "
Overall Love  I bought this vehicle two weeks after it was on the market. Major issues have been doors jamming and mine are not automatic. I have had problems with both sides not closing. When my seats are folded into the floor the car squeaks loudly...annoying. Brakes are definitely an issue and my brake servicer blames the calipers. I have had a couple sensors fail that literally stopped my vehicle from moving. Fuel economy is not so hot but I did see that on the sticker upfront. This van does handle very nicely and everyone who has driven it is impressed and surprised. I have five kids and it is very roomy.
"Better than a Honda  If you are looking for an economical fully loaded minivan, I strongly recommend that you look into the Entourage.  My family and I thoroughly love our van.  We have family friends that own one as well and they love theirs as well.  My only knock on the vehicle is its gas mileage.  Other than that, it is an outstanding family vehicle.  Go drive one and compare it to a Honda.  Once you have driven both vans and you look at the cost difference, I am sure that you will understand why I recommend this vehicle.  By the way, this is the 7th Hyundai that me and my extended family (brother-in-law, grandparents and second for me) have purchased."
"Third Van, Sad it is not sold now  I bought my Hyundai brand new May 2007. Also owned Dodge and Pontiac vans, comparable to both.  Just turned 66,000 miles.  Commute 35 miles per day, can cruise easily at 70+ mph, consistent 21+ MPG,  will sometimes get to 80 mph+ without realizing it.  Plenty of room for big guy-I am 6'2"", 300 lbs+.  No kids, just 2 dogs, but wife and I love using the van to go tent camping and fishing with them.  Outlets very handy.  Never used DVD system, but sound system so good it must be used at less than 30% volume. Lack of parts availability for warranty work in Alaska frustrating.  Only complaints:  Remote door operation, fixed.  TPMS monitoring system, not yet fixed.  Driver's power seat a little rocky"
"Feeling luck I guess..  I read some of the reviews and wonder if we are all talking about the same van. After 3 years of driving we had very few problems, just some minor things fixed under warranty...pulley bearings, A/C compressor clutch. Original tires lasted 50K miles, battery 3 yrs. Power doors and gate work perfectly, everything is perfect except the fuel consumption could be better. Mixed city/hwy driving: Wife 18 mpg, me 20.5, long trip mpg about 23. "
"Dream Car  I have owned and driven a lot of cars over the years but this is "" the one"".  "
Happy With the Mom Mobile  Purchased this car after finding out that I was having twins.   We travel a lot and I needed a car that I could hop in the back easily.  This was the van for us. The interior is very classy with woodgrain and leather.  It has lots of cup holders.  Sound system is pretty good.  Heated seats get HOT! No troubles so far except a couple minor recalls.  Happy with our purchase and would recommend.
"should have painted it yellow  The van looks good and drives nice but don't let that fool you!  The fuel economy is no were near what we were told. The brakes are a disaster and needed replacing after only 35000 km rotors and all. The idler failed after 50000 km. Had to be towed for a computer failure. the latches on the side doors fail.  if you open the driver's door in the rain, you will not be able to close the gas cap door.  There are problems with the wiring in the back door.  there are always light on the dash that shouldn't be on , last being a problem with the air bags!!  If you don't live next to the dealer ship or want to keep the van past it's warranty, don't buy it!"
"Never again  We have an 2007 Entourage and wish we could get rid of it, the A/C clunks when you first start the engine, something a $28,000.00 new van should not do. After replacing the A/C twice, Hyundai finally said that was normal in all Entourage's, so live with it, and we found that when the Rep from Hyundai in California makes a decision, that's as far as it goes. Great company policy, if I were to lose my job, they would take it back, but have a serious problem with their product and it's tough! I have a 2006 KIA(sister company) Sorento with 17,000 more miles on it then the Entourage, and the KIA rides, drives and sounds better then the Hyundai. Did I mention it sounds like a tank when cold."
"GREAT VEHICLE  I've owned the vehicle for 2 1/2 years & have over 64,000 miles; the only problem I ever had was the sliding doors getting jammed; we just had them repaired (nationwide problem we were told) never had any other problems; dealership has great service; they remember me by name when I go in for service (oil changes regularly); the only thing I don't care for is the resale value; there is none; depreciates too quickly "
Disappointed...  I bought my 2007 Entourage in Spring of 2007.  Automatic sliding doors have not worked properly since I bought it.  Every time I bring it in for service I am told that nothing is wrong with the doors.  Only other problem is the gas mileage averages about 17 MPG - not what I had expected.  I want to get rid of it so bad - but the value has dropped so much - i can't get rid of it!!!
"Good van for what you need it for  I've owned this van for over a year now, and have not had any problems at all with it.  I purchased it used with 20k miles, and I've since put on 10k, mostly on the highway.  The van is large and spacious, similar to Odyssey, Sienna and Caravan (I've driven all of these).  The performance is very good considering it's size, and you have to remember that it's a minivan, not a sports car.  I think the build quality is good, not quite up to Sienna or Odyssey levels, but on par with the Caravan.  The 5 year 60k mile warranty is a reassuring factor, but I have not yet had to take advantage of it.  Also, I think gas mileage is pretty good, I get about 26 mpg on the highway, with a moderate load."
Hyundai messed this one up!!!  Bought used in Dec. 06 with 11000 miles.  It was Factory Reps vehicle.  Was sold on Hyundai because of previous experience with Elantra and Sonata.  This van has had 22 warranty claims since bought.  The van is very competitive with Toyota and Honda in design and function just not in the owner satisfaction category.  I feel that the biggest issue with this van in the dealerships service.  Hyundai dealers remind me of the Domestic dealers from the past big on selling just not on service.  You should not have to continuously take a vehicle in for the same issue and be told we don't know whats wrong with it sorry about your luck.  They have fixed everything except the whine in right rear speaker.  
"Do NOT buy or patronize this Product  Its not good to say that I was cheap because I just happen to get my money's worth paying less which is 10,000 to 15,000 dollars compared to Toyota Sienna or Honda Odyssey.  We bought and wasted 31,000 dollars for this PIECE OF JUNK.  After sales service is WORST.  They always advertise how great their warranty is, but, its just an advertisement.  Auto sliding doors are always jammed.  Instrumentation panel is not reliable.  Cruise control does not work properly.  Sharp edge on the steering wheel."
"Do NOT BUY a Hyundai Entourage EVER   We got our Entourage when it first came out cause we love hyundai cars, and needed a bigger family vehicle. We loved this vehicle until we started having major issues with it. We have already had to have the entire electrical system of the van replaced after only having it 11/2 yrs and it needs to be replaced again. Our power doors are a nightmare. They close then open right back up. When they actually do close the track keeps going even after the door is closed. When we pull on the door handles to open the doors they don't open. With in the last 9 months our van has been in the shop over 8 times, for the same things over and over again.Now i understand why you need the warranty they offer."
"Wish I didn't buy it!  We paid for the extended warranty and glad that we did! Brakes started squealing within the first six months, tires did not last as long as they should have, battery died after about 50000 miles. They have had to change the air compressor, the fuel sensor, and a few other parts. We have had to get it towed twice. "
"My dream car!  I've had my eye on Mustangs for years and now finally bought my dream car, and not disappointed.  It exceeds every expectation.  LOVE THIS CAR!
 It's got enough umph but also enough gas mileage (averaging 24).  Just the right balance.  Best thing about this car is that it's super good-looking and just downright FUN FUN FUN to drive!  
 You can't go wrong.  It's not perfect in every way but still head-over-heals in love with this car!  Oh, and did I mention that I love this car?
"
"Piece of Junk  Bought van 2 years ago and it has been in the shop 11 times.  3 new batteries, 2 new oxygen sensors, 2 tension pulleys.....it just goes on and on.  25,000 miles and the Michelins wouldn't pass inspection they were so bald.  Brakes were starting to squeal.  Decided to trade and even with rebates etc we lost 5 grand!  It was losing $1000 in kelly blue book every month.  Do not buy this van you will regret it and be so far in debt on it you can't get out!"
Great Car  I like the car very much. It is fun to drive. I also like the safety features. I like the room it has for hauling. 
"Luv the van hate the problems  I couldn't wait to buy my first brand new van. Have had this van for one and a half years and have replaced the timing chain 3 times, and it needs a fourth. Have had problems with the tpms also. The dealership has been extremely helpful. But how many times can it go in for the same part? "
Great Van  We purchased the 2007 Entourage SE in early 2007 with 100000 mile warranty and 2 years/24000 miles of free oil changes for ~$23000.  Odometer now shows 25500 miles.  We have driven between Colorado Springs and Boulder CO many times as well as 2 trips to Lake Tahoe.  I am very surprised at how many complaints there are regarding mpg - we get 25-27 mpg for our 100+ mile trips and 21mpg for my daily commute of 12 miles.  I am conscious of my driving technique and avoid mashing the accelerator or overusing the brakes.  I am pleased to report that the mpg display above the rear view mirror is very accurate - within .5mpg every time.  I always keep write down miles/gas every time I fill up.
"Don't Buy One!!!  We bought this van because of what you were supposed to get for the money. The van is very nice looking inside and out, however the problems just keep getting bigger.  Problems started with warning lights coming on then the A/C compressor, now it's the brakes and doors.  "
"Not what I bargained for  This car is fabulous in theory as a family vehicle.  Unfortunately I am taking it in constantly because of random noises such as creaks and grinds.  The fuel economy is ridiculous. COMPLETELY different than the sticker showed.  My battery died after 15,0000 miles and less than 2 years old and it was impossible to find a service dept available to help me.  I was sold by the price when comparing to competitors but I should have gone with something with better history for a little more money."
"Worst mileage...EVER..any car  Car drives and rides comfortably. Lots of conveniences and ""goodies"". But with gradual increasing noises. Dealing with Hyundai is impossible and mileage is bad beyond description. My 'truck' Toyota 4 runner gets 5 miles more to the gallon of gas and Hyundai say mine (entourage) is behaving as designed.... Wow"
Good So Far  Nice vehicle for a family of 5 and no troubles so far. Lots of Space. Own a GLS model which has many features available as Standard which are either Optional or available only on higher models with other Manufacturer's Vans. Bought the vehicle for the just over 20 grand price & due to it's higher safety ratings. We have made at least 5 long distance drives and surprisingly the mileage was 27 mpg on the Highway. City driving is around 17 mpg. We have traveled 16000 miles in the last 1 year and the van has served the purpose well. Struggles a bit going uphill. So far good experience with Dealership.
"""comfort mobile""  happy family hauler  It's a minivan.  It's bigger than a car and very heavy, like other minivans. For us it's an appliance like a refrigerator or washing machine.  Yes, the doors will close on little fingers- don't let your kids put their hands in closing doors.  Let them fear any doors closing. It will squeak.  Push on panels to reseat fasteners.  They will be quiet. Two minor issues repaired under warranty: Cold weather caused spring loaded parking brake release to stick, replacement of cables and pedal assembly resolved issue. Idler pulley bearing failure, replacement solved issue. Van will average 29 MPG on flat ground at 60 MPH with NO stop and go. Daily drives around town average 17 MPG."
GREAT VAN FOR THE PRICE  Drive the speed limit and you will get good gas mileages..drives nice and with good power...Have not had any problems with the van as of now.........do my own oil changes....
"Still a Great Fun Car for my 84 year old friend!  This is an update:  I unfortunately had to sell my 2017.  Became too hard to get out of.  I loved it in every other way, but was hurting my joints, the bucket seat is so deep and low.  I got a 2017 Honda CRV Touring new (#1 class rating), and I love it.  It's not a convertible (but has a sunroof). All in all, I really like it and my Aunt and Uncle liked it so well, for the same reasons, they traded in their Lincoln Town Car and bought a new CRV, the same as mine, top of the line. Apparently they liked it!!! Haha! PS - I got $24K for my 7 month old Mustang, paid $42K for it.  Terrible depreciation - 43%. KBB by owner price = $27K, which still stinks. Be forewarned: they allow NOTHING for all those extra whistles and bells. I expect the Honda to really hold value.  Still, was worth the taking the beating to feel and walk better.Original reviews follow: I had a white convertible, medium stone interior since I live at a warm beach.  This is an update, since I sold it to an 83 year old gentleman who is having the time of his life with it.  50K miles with only one A/C issue so far. I retired from work in Alaska, so I wanted all the fresh air and sunshine I could get to make up for all the time spent indoors up in the land of the great outdoors (like most everyone I knew).  This car fills the bill.  Road trips are minimal in Alaska, but after 30 years of travel commuting I am staying home except for a trip to Atlanta last summer. However, I plan to go to Seattle to see my son next Spring, and maybe more trips after that. For that and other reasons I bought a brand new 2017 Mustang convertible. Mainly, this is due to all the new accident avoidance technology.  Decided on the Ecoboost and I couldn't be happier.   I got the Ecoboost without the performance package (for a smoother ride), but all electronics for $42K. Straight line acceleration above usable for merging isn't most important at my age, but I did take it up smoothly to the electronic-limited 121 mph once. The rear diffuser makes it hug the road even more at high speed. Gets up to 32 mpg on highway. It is a wonderful car.  Even my BMW friends are jealous. The open top is the main thing, and the GT noise would block out the birds singing.  But, if someone doesn't have the money to buy a new one, I recommend the 2014 highly.  Lots of fun for the money. It got me to the beach for my every morning walk with the early rays of sun on the water, and along the waterfront under the stars at night.  My older friend is still loving it and he brags to whoever will listen.  This is an update and he still loves that 2014.  He has the old fashioned class with sports jacket and roadster cap and is a cool old man."
"deceptive warranty  Until about 6 months ago, I would have said that I was very happy with my van.  Now the slider doors are not closing properly (seems to be a common complaint), yet the service dept at our local dealership cannot find anything wrong.  The biggest issue is the water leaking from the sunroof, dripping from the control panel(dome lights/door openers,etc.  Also, water leaking from the dash when it rains, collecting water on the floor of the passenger side.  There are tons of wires down there, so I can't imagine what kind of fun I have to look forward to.  I am told that the warranty does not cover ""leaks"", I find it outrageous that Hyundai thinks that this is normal wear & tear."
"So Far, So Good  I have had the van for just about 10 months now.  So far, its been very reliable, and was surprisingly very fuel efficient on a recent vacation trip (24 mpg on highway!)  I have only had a few minor issues with automatic doors not closing properly every time and a passenger seat belt that likes to lock up.  I would recommend this van to anyone with a couple of kids who needs more space than cars are able to give."
"Reliable Hyundai Entourage GLS  My family & I have had this vehicle for a year now w/over 15,000 miles & have traveled a lot since then. So far, we have not encountered any ""major"" problems that other people have stated in there reviews. I spoke w/a Hyundai mechanic & he told me that this is a heavy vehicle w/a 3.8 Liter V6 engine. So of course the gas mileage is not great. Also a vehicle is considered broken in after 35-50,000 miles & that is when you will start having better gas mileage. But, it also depends on your driving style and terrain as well. My advice, save your money & stick w/a basic van. After reading other reviews, owners of vans w/more amenities seem to have more problems than others,ie. power doors 4 example."
"Quality of Interior Trim and Low Gas Mil  The imitation leather trim is starting to split.  The van squeaks, makes strange noise when air conditioner not on, and the gas mileage is terrible.  Door opens intermittently after closing. Dealer could find nothing wrong with any of these complaints.  Will never again purchase new model of any car/van.  Door closed on my grandson's finger. Limited driver and front passenger storage space. Third row seat cramped.  It is very inconvenient to have to place car in park to open rear doors.  When DVD player is open, it greatly limits driver's rear view visibility.  Van drives nicely. I trusted Hyundai name but will wait in the future for them to remove all of the bugs before buying a new model."
"Great Van  I am a used car dealer and just replaced my wifes Dodge Caravan with this used Entourage Limited with 13,000 miles. Let's just say that she is much happier with this than with the Dodge. It's not that I had problems with the Dodge, it's just the package as a whole she likes better. With all the amenities that this van has, it's perfect. It's a much better value than the Toyota or Honda. Your dollar definitely goes further. "
"Interior Integrity?  I have owned my Entourage SE for approximately one year and 14,000 miles.  The squeaks, rattles, and other pronounced noises are very apparent, especially in the cooler weather.  Caution! In your Warranty manual, you will find a section where as these obnoxious noises will not be covered under the bumper to bumper warranty. I feel that new owners are not waiting long enough before writing a review. I made this critical mistake. I should have spent a bit more money for the Honda Odyssey."
Very Poor Reliability   DO NOT PURCHASE (2007 model)  Problems to date  1) Power steering gasket blew (under 2 yrs old)  2) Reversing sensors are unreliable and do not work consistently.. Hyundai can not reproduce and therefore are not willing to replace under warranty (we have even sent a video of the problem to them).  3) Unable to start van.. power & battery OK.. had it towed to dealer... next day van started ok.  4) Brake calipers under sized for weight of van.. rotors wearing down fast and warping under heat.  5) Customer service a disgrace.  If anybody else in Western canada has these problems with Hyundai please drop me a note. 
"Very pleased  Love power this van has for its size. Love the way it handles. I got this van used with 9000 miles on it and it now has 11,700 miles and I have had no problems so far. Great van with a great price."
Very Poor Reliability  I have owned other Hyundai products and have loved them. The 2007 Entourage van has been a nightmare. It has stalled on us several times and has had various electrical problems. Trim pcs. and hardware in general are falling off and are of poor quality. Gas mileage is terrible (13 in city and just under 20 on hwy). Ouch!!! I would strongly recommend not buying the 2007 model and get the 2008 or 2009 as I would hope Hyundai has worked out all the bad bugs from the 2007 year. Avoid at all cost the 2007! Very disappointing experience to date.
"Watch out if you had kids!!!  My boyfriend bought the van over a year ago for him and his kids. He was sold on the ""safety feature"" that said that any obstruction would automatically open the side door. Since then we have constantly had problems with the power doors-- if you are on any type of incline, the power doors have a great chance of not closing as well as sliding forward on their own. His 9 year old son has actually had his hand crushed in the doors (that DID NOT automatically open) when he was reaching to grab his seat belt to buckle in as the door closed. Both of his children are now terrified of the closing doors and warn their friends to not touch the doors. I am almost 30 and even I get nervous about it."
"Happy Wife...  Got my wife an Ingot Silver '14 Mustang convertible a few weeks ago to replace her aging Taurus.Nothing but smiles every time she talks about it.Weather permitting, she drives everywhere with the top down and enjoys the comments she gets about her car.It is quick and smooth and the miles just melt away when going on road trips with the sun shining and the top down.Hands down the most FUN car in thirty plus years of buying cars together.Low front end caught her a few days ago when she pulled into a parking spot and drove the front end up onto a curb popping a bunch of things loose in the front end...minimum of $1050 to repair but still waiting to get it back and see the full bill. "
"Most bang for your buck  After a history of Saturns, it was time for a minivan.  Honda was out of our price range.  Grand Caravan seemed cheap inside.  We scored after finding this used and the dealer thought it was a base model (& priced as such!)!  Great power, 17 mpg seems typical, SO roomy, long warranty, lots of features, awesome safety rating, and everyone thinks it's a Honda at first glance!  We've owned it for 5 months and 6K miles.  We did have a dead battery and they replaced it with no problems.  Very happy with our local dealership.  After being a Saturn-only family for 10 years, our newly adopted Hyundai fits in just fine!"
Its a squeaker  My 07 Entourage is a squeaker in the back end.  Nothing the dealer does fixes it.  It has actually gotten worse since their last fix job.   I think it is a design flaw. 
Won't start  For the first year it was great! Soon after the automatic doors would pop open a few seconds after they were closed. Then one day it would not start. It has power but will not crank. It has been in the shop 5 times for not starting and it always starts with the doors acting funny. I also have the squeaks and rattles and the engine has an odd sound when the air is running. The gas mileage is not as great as claimed. I would not care about those things if I just had a vehicle I can get in and know it will not leave me stranded waiting on a tow truck and wasting an entire day. I have started the lemon law process. I hope Hyundai does the right thing and gives me the van I thought I was purchasing.
"Excellent minivan  We have the minivan for 8 months now withou even a minor problem. Everything was much better than we expected. We tried all the well know minivan such as Toyota, Honda and Chrysler before we brought the Hyundai, but none of them compare well with the Hyundai in the same price range. Everything were so well designed, they may be standard in many minivan now, but Hyundai did it well too. "
"Spend more, go for Honda or Toyota  We have had nothing but problems from our 2007 entourage.  It has been in the shop for 26 business days (m-f only) and 5 times (8000 mi).  We have the same knocking noise others have mentioned, which it has gone up in smoke for (a/c burned out) and stranded us on the interstate w/ my 4 mo old.  We have rattles/creaks etc.  Poor gas mileage.  The a/c is knocking again and we are claiming lemon law.  Just yesterday after picking it up from being at the dealer 2 weeks, the airbag light came on.  We were told they couldn't get it in until Friday (it is wed) but not to drive it b/c we won't have airbags in the event of a crash (no rentals avail). And Hyundai warranty does not guarantee a rental."
"into 9 months  Had dodge and vw minivans before, this is the best one.  Great size, best pick up and comfort. At 6ft4 I'm most relaxed on long drives. Cargo is more than adequate.  I just wish the mpg was higher they had gps standard."
"Disappointed  After much research and test drives we chose the Entourage because of its comfort, long list of features but most of all, the safety rating for our 3 children. After only a short time we began having problems with front end knocking and vibrating. The brakes wobble, the rear end squeaks and the check enging light frequently comes on as does the air bag light. I've lost count of the amount of times the van has been in the shop but the condition of the van is the same and getting worse. It's obvious now why there is 100k warranty. You definitely need it with this very undependable vehicle. The dealership is useless and the service department is awful. "
"Looks great, can't beat the warranty  I thought I'd buy a Honda and be like other good mom's driving an Odyssey.  But they wanted about $6K more and a 36K warranty?  This family uses the van, we're talking miles, last van-4 years-116K miles.  Mileage folks!  When we test drove, we parked at a mall to look things over, right next to a family with a top-of-the-line Honda van.  The mom keep looking over and asked, what van is that?  The Hyundai looks almost like the Honda but I think a little shaper.  So far only a couple minor fixes, computer chip, pulley.  The original dealer was less than stellar after the sale.  But around DC none are known for customer service.  Overall a good van and good value for the money.  Good warranty."
"Finest Vehicle Ever!  My last van was a Town & Country and I was planing to purchase another one, however, after test driving most of the vans on the market including the Hyundai Entourage, I believe the Entourage is the finest vehicle I have ever owned. The smooth ride, very powerful engine, I love everything about the vehicle. I purchased the high end Limited model with the ultimate package.  The leather seats are very comfortable.  The second row captain seats move back and forth. The third row seats can be folded into the floor.  The five speed automatic with overdrive allows great gas mileage around 25 MPG with the engine at around 2 grand on the tack at 75 MPH.  A very fine vehicle, bar none.  Thank you!"
Verdict still out  Fun to drive and overall nice looking van. Reliability is the question? Van did not start six times this winter. Found out there is a TSB on the junction box/fuse assembly. Just brought in for the second time for this issue. Dealer replaced battery. Hope this does the trick as I really like the van(when it starts). 
"My 5.0 GT Premium Convertible 6 Speed  There she was - 5.0 vert with a 6 speed, loaded, white with a black roof and interior.The car is very spritely, almost go kart like, especially after trading in a Hemi Challenger. She rides on rails, stops on a dime and is jack rabbit quick. The interior fit me better than the SS and sight lines are better in the GT. The interior, its comfortable & ergonomic. It's not gadgety or gimmicky. The GT is more suited to a 50+ year old than the SS. Wrap up - For me, it's a great choice with no regrets. Enjoy the ride."
"Can't beat the warranty  The transmission self destructed on our 1998 Sienna XLE.  We weren't planning on a new vehicle purchase so another Sienna XLE was just plain out of our price range.  We found an 2007 SE with nearly all of the bells and whistles of the Limited.  It landed right in our price range.   We will miss our Sienna (it is going to be donated), but the Entourage is bigger, faster, quieter, and has tons more safety and convenience features, while getting the same or better fuel economy.  Lastly, it is nice to have a warranty that outlasts the payments.  We even upgraded the bumper to bumper to cover the bells and whistles.  At the price we got it for ($7000 below MSRP), we could afford to."
"Never thought I'd buy a Hyundai  Ok, I'm the last person that would think I'd buy a Hyundai.  But I test drove th Entorage and I was hooked.  Quieter that a Honda as well appointed as a Toyota and for thousands less!  Forget what you think you know about Hyundai.  This is just as nice as anything else I test drove.  The 100k warranty is just the kicker it took for me to write the check.  You owe it to yourself to try one out if you are in the market for a minivan."
"Good Value  Bought in 04/07, had some problems with knocking in front end early on, was some bushings which dealer fixed. Mileage has been around 16 in mixed c/h with 22/23 hw going about 75mph. First tried Toy/Honda but similar quality with this and this has better warr. Nice inside and out. Great standard CD/Stereo sound system. Very good power in engine/transmission with smooth ride, low noise. Heated seats/dual power drs are really nice, wish I had bought the pw rear dr. I'm 6'2"", 250lb and have plenty of room in all rows of seats. More color options would be nice. Haven't had any of problems encountered  by some other listed here.  Wife and I and 2 kids have been happy.   "
Great Van  This has been a great car. The dealer service has also been great. This is one of the finest cars I have ever owned.  
"Viv's Entourage  You have to floor it to pull out in a yield situation, not good in rush hour traffic. Parking brake doesn't work properly.  I had it repaired 4 times, still makes noise. The steering wheel doesn't fit the seat postion.  I need the seat back for my long legs but the steering wheel doesn't pull out to meet my arm position I'm comfortable with. No automatic lock, in this day and age, this is a must.  I have a note to remind me to lock doors.  This is my 4th minivan, my other used vans had this feature."
"Good Buy  I was very impressed with Hyundai when I took the Entourage on a test drive.  I was shopping for a Honda mini van, and saw a Entourage.  I drove a Honda Odyssey, and then drove the Entourage.  The Odyssey did handle a little better, but it lacked power that the Entourage had.  The main thing that sold me on the Hyundai was the price, and the awesome warranty that the car came with.  I mean come on 5 year 60,000 Bumper to Bumper, and 10 year 100,000 miles powertrain, how can you pass that up.  The Honda did not offer that.  You had to pay thousands for that extended warranty on the honda.  The MPG could be a little better, but that may be my habut related problem.  I highly recommend it.     "
enjoying my Hyundai  i enjoy driving .I do not like the way my keyhole lockout I have carpal tunnel and some time it is hard to get unlocker also I do not like where the hieght of the gearstick is it inter fers with the ashtray.  the volume button on ther steeringwheelare go but sometime you accedently change the mode.  but over the safety air bags is the reason I got the car  it was more pricee then advertized.
"A Great Vacation Ride  I rented a 2007 Entourage in Salt Lake City for an 8 day, 1800 mile vacation through Grand Teton and Yellowstone Parks. The drive was on mountainous roads in winter conditions. This vehicle has a strong drivetrain with fast acceleration and effortless mountain climbing power. Handling was sporty and the ride very comfortable. Gas mileage was outstanding and amazing averaging about 27 mpg. This included a considerable amount of stop and go driving between scenic turnouts in both parks, and some idling to keep warm while viewing wildlife, not to mention the cold weather conditions and, at times, snow covered roads. Overall, I am very impressed with this vehicle."
59k  We have 59k on the van to date and have had no problems.
"12 repairs in 12 months  At first, I was completely thrilled with our purchase. However, then the problems started. We have had two oil leaks in the first year, one spontaneously shredding wiper (scratched windshield!) followed by two spontaneously NOT-working wipers. Also, we are currently in the arbitration process trying to resolve a loud knocking noise in the front of the car. This alone has brought the car into the shop 5 times!!  The gas mileage is definitely lower than advertised, and for the mpg that I actually get, I would rather have a large suv with more power.  I do *like* the car's design though. It works well for our family with 3 small children, and comfortably fits all that we require."
"2014 Mustang Convertible  Wow ! Driving a 2014 V6 Convertible around Central Florida is FUN ! There are compromises - V6 for regular gas, automatic tranny more practical when I4 is a parking lot. BUT - this car hugs the road, loves curves, accelerates & brakes smoothly. I enjoy the handling as much as my wife appreciates the smooth ride. Still learning to use the SYNC, but I'm getting there."
"HYUNDAI - MADE IN CHINA?  WOW, I was told I had the only Entourage in AMerica with the vibration problems. Usually around 70mph, but also while braking.  Since purchasing in June of 06, dealer had vehicle 2 months trying to ""fix"".  They replaced both front wheel hubs and for 60+ days my problem stopped. Cancelled BBB complaint. It has been a nightmare since then.  Still have vibrations, but not all the time. The brake rotors have been turned three times, replaced twice along with pads the last time.  Hyundai rep replaced on a goodwill basis. Ain't he nice? Hyundai is finally making me an offer to replace the vehicle completely.  Of course I have to pay for the miles I put on, and Hyundai thinks that is fair. "
"Goodbye SUV....lovin' the van!  Probably the best bang-for-your-buck vehicle on the planet, and it looks sharp, too!  Paid $25K out the door for an SE trim even with over $1K upside down on the trade.  SE trim is worth the extra $$ -- much ""nicer"" inside and out.  I don't know how the rest of these people drive, but gas mileage for me averages between 20 and 23 mpg -- great considering it has the biggest engine in its class.  Drives like a dream -- great visibility, power and comfort.  Considering a comparably equipped Honda or Toyota was $8K, not to mention their warranties were no match, the decision on this vehicle was an easy one!"
"The Facts  For the mileage I drive mostly highway (80%)and after 3000 miles I averaged 22 MPG.  I can only say that if you are seeing 15 MPG as some have stated, there is a serious problem that needs to be looked at. I can't see why there isn't more of them on the road. My dealer took 2 weeks to find one in red and they didn't have any on their lot. My negatives are... No mp3 jack. Brakes are way too sensitive. Hyundai's radios have always been poor. ( I have owned 4 other Hyundais)The reception is even worse with the in the window antenna. Darker carpet color to hide tracked in dirt. Floor mats are not standard. Give me a break."
"You're just wasting $$ with Honda,Toyota  Like most looking at this car, I needed a family hauler. Looked at SUV's (actually fell in love with the Mazda CX-9 and the Hyundai Veracruz. Sad thing about both are you carry the family or 'stuff' - but not both. Now I was stuck looking at minivans. Compared the Toy, Honda and the Hyundai and there was only 1 choice. Maybe people feel better spending $40k+ on the same thing from Honda but not me. I like the better warrentee. Build quality is the SAME believe it or not. All the new Hyundai's in the last couple of years have had amazing reliability, rivaling anything from Japan. Spend more if you want to - but all you'll gain is a few more MPG!"
"Look out ""Big Boys""  Just purchased a Hyundai Entourage last month.  Canadian model was the GLS which is the USA - SE equivalent.  I am very pleased with the performance and style of this vehicle.  I have owed various vans since 1975 and rate this one at the top of my list.   The safety features...i.e - ASC, multiple air bags, traction control and back up warning sensors are must options.  I have been getting decent mileage (25 mpg ) on the hwys which I feel is good considering the power and size of this van.  Hyundai has come a long way with the quality of there vehicles since inception and now can compete favourably with the ""Big Boys"" (Honda, Toyota, Nissan and Chrysler )  "
"Replaced my Ford Windstar  Bought an Entourage to replace a 1999 Ford Windstar that died on us with only 99,000 miles. Entourage gets about the same gas mileage as our old Ford, but has tons more features for the money, smoother and quieter ride, handles much better too. Broke in the first 1200 miles on winding mountain roads and enjoyed every minute. Was looking at Toyotas but liked the warranty and the lower purchase price. Absolutely no problems to report."
great minivan  
Love it!  We bought our Entourage June of 08' and we have 3 little ones including on with special needs that uses a wheelchair and walker...it has suited us all well.We love how comfy it is and the only thing we wish we had gotten now is the built in DVD player.
"Great Van  Purchased new in July 09 as a dealership car with 10,000 miles. Just finished 10 week 9,500 mile trip, and could not be happier with this van. Plenty of room, comfortable, handled great (including mountain roads. More accessories than I even needed. Gas mileage was very good, 21.4 overall. City has been about 17.1 and highway has varied between 20.5 to 24.5.  Only issue was with AC. Clicking on and off, but was fixed under warranty in another state than I purchased car in.  My second Hyundai, and have been very pleased with warranty and performance.  Is the top of the line.........NO! But price for what you get is superior to anything out there. Not to mention the warranty."
"Wish I could afford another  After 5 months of exhausting research, shopping and driving them all, I was convinced the Entourage was the best. Now after 8 months of owning the van I wish I could afford a 2nd one. It's very quick, quiet and comfortable. MPG avg 18-19 around town and 22-24 hwy. An all around excellent vehicle that I feel very safe putting my family in. Check out the crash photos on the NHTSA site. Impressive.  Even though I chose the Hyundai, I'm glad Kia\Hyundai settled on one van. I don't believe re-badging the same vehicle makes sense. My 2nd one will have to be a loaded-up Sedona EX."
"Reliable car   Only a few problems have shown up in 107K miles. I have replaced the fuel pump, alternator, battery, tires, and suspension. Of those, only the fuel pump was unexpected. The rest are things you expect to replace.144K mile update. Car still running strong. Since the last review, I have gone through another battery and tires."
"Can't believe I love a van  We have taken two trips with this van and love it. The room is great especially considering we have a 6 month old. Miss my controls on the steering wheel and my auto headlights that my other car had, but I am getting used to the lack of these features. Gas mileage could be better. Wish we could have afforded the upgraded model, but love van overall. "
"new entourage  I bought my entourage 6 months ago, limited. it is the best part of our trip, everyone is comfortable, room for things cups you name it. the trunk always has space to spare, not mentioning the center area in the rear, the side space between the seats and the door is grand. and the dvd system blows me away. besides it has inputs for consoles or anything else. it is by far the most quiet, stable, economic, fun to ride and drive and powerful (consider the engine size) car that I have ever ridden. I cant wait to take another trip. and for everyday use in the city. economy is better than the competition."
HIGHWAY CRUISER   This is my third Hyundai purchase and I am sold on their quality .... Zero problems
So far so good  Bought this vehicle three weeks ago at an awesome price since they are discontinuing it.  Couldn't beat the price and all the features we got.  Been very happy with it so far seeing as how I didn't want another minivan.
"Too Bad Hyundai Axed the Entourage  So after almost 5 months of ownership, I can say that I am truly impressed with the Entourage.  All the forum complaints on the power doors, wheel vibration, battery drain, and gas mileage have not been part of my experience.  They van has been flawless since day one, except for a crooked Entourage emblem and broken conversation mirror, both of which were fixed under warranty.  If they still made the Entourage, I would be recommending it to everyone.  I guess the Kia Sedona is the equivalent, but from what I've read, the Entourage is a little bit more upscale, although at a slight increase in cost. If you can still find one, I bet you can get a great deal on this great minivan."
BAD WARRANTY  I bought this vehicle in March of 2009 and in the first two weeks I noticed a discoloring in the headlight lens which I was told would not be replaced under the warranty and now I am sitting at two month mark and I am having problems with my driver's seat rocking and popping and now I am being told that yjis also will not be a warranty repair. I will never buy another Hyundai again.
"Happy  I have taken my van on two long distance trip, I am very satisfied.  The comfort and handling is very good.  Fun to drive...trip computer rear sensors great features...I wish I would of upgraded to receive the power gate.  The back do not always close properly when loaded."
Entourage  I find the Van to be acceptable for the price and features.  Nothing fancy to it.  Good enough for my family of 5.
Great family car!  I never thought I would drive a minivan but I actually like this one. It is a great family vehicle and it rides very nice.
"Our experience.....  We have had our Entourage for over a year, and have been overall happy with our van. As a family with 5 children, we give two thumbs up for spaciousness and being comfortable. I love the deep well in the rear for grocery shopping day. The two side auto doors are so helpful! I have found the gas mileage to be horrible at 17 mpg on the hywy. Also, I do not like that every time I fill up the van with gas....without warning, when it is full, gas spews out! I have to be careful. "
"Favorite Car I've Owned  Bought this car with 104,000 miles on it, and wow, good car for the money. It might seem like thats high mileage, but I bought it with an extended warrenty. I bought it with many performance upgrades, and I have to say it helps this car with its performance and personality. I drove a stock 01 GT, and it felt a bit boring. The interior leaves something to be desired, but it's simple and has no extra fluff you don't need. All in all, it is a good all rounder that now a days is a good used alternantive to a brand new one. "
"Better than other minivan  Good looking exterior and excellent mileage. 14~16 mpg in city, 26~30 mpg on Hwy.  Detaching middle seats is not easy but it give me very spacious cabin, very useful for loading so many things like sofa. "
"Really great luxury  van  I purchased my Hyundai van 2 months ago and have been very happy with the way it drives. It is very comfortable inside as well. I love the automatic side doors and the automatic back hatch door. It has a very smooth ride and great pick-up-and-go. But, the gas mileage is terrible. I expected to get at least 15mpg as advertised, but I only get at best 12.5mpg around town. Apparently that is what most owners are learning. Overall I am extremely satisfied with the Entourage. I hope Hyundai is able to improve the gas mileage in the future."
"Awesome minivan for the price!  We purchased our 2008 Entourage a few weeks ago and love it! The ride is smooth and the space inside is roomy.Hyundai seems like there heading in the right direction, the only downside is the fuel mileage. But were very happy and would definitely recommend it before 34k Honda Odyssey!"
"Hyundai 2008 Entourage Limited  Overall we have found the van acceptable.  Having traded a Pontiac ssei sedan for the van beacuse of medical reasons we've found many of the amenities of the sedan lacking in the van and not available as an option.  However, for the task of carrying medical equipment it is acceptable.  The large amount of room is pleasing.  Gas mileage isn't great, especially for a 250 hp engine.  The sedan got 19 mpg in town, 23 mpg on the highway and was a 3.8l, turbocharged 276 hp engine.  "
"Very pleased  Only have had the van for 2 weeks but we are loving it.  The room, the drive.  So far so good."
"love it  only had the van for three weeks but love the way it handles and very surprize of the pick up this van has for it its size.to change the oil,the filter is on the top of the motor,I never saw that before."
"Been a Great car!!  Make sure the timing chain tensioners either have been repaired or aren't making noise, unfortunately Hyundai didn't recall and it's a costly repair. Beside`s that it's been a great car I hate having to sell it."
"Could have kept forever  This was the best car I had ever owned to that time (I have owned cars for 60+ years).  It was fairly priced. required almost no repairs in 190,000 miles, and was a pleasure to drive, especially on the open highway.  So good I replaced it , after 12 years of ownership,  with a newer Sonata, which has the great qualities of the old ones, plus is more up-to-date."
Run away  Beware of the electrical problems you will encounter.The am reception is horrendous.Noisy suspension.Shop other vehicles that are far more dependable.
Hyundai is great  I’ve owned 4 different Hyundai’s and they have all been very reliable
Best shape its ever been in...  I HAD a 2004 GT until last week when my girlfriend totaled it. she was t- boned it went air-borne did 5 flips and landed upside down. that car saved her life however and even though its a total loss its the best shape i've ever seen it in
"Wish they still made cars as sturdy as this one!  We've had our 2006 Hyundai Sonata since 2006. It's proven to be very reliable, easy to handle, and it ""fits"" me well. Whatever Hyundai did in 2006 they did it right!"
"Do not waste your money  Yesterday (December 12, 2017), I was driving home from being at a store. I was on I-40. All of the sudden, I lose power, my speed is decreasing, steering locks up and I am very lucky that I was not killed. I was able to make it into Star buck parking lot. The car will not start. The steering wheel will not move. I call a tow truck to come tow the car to a mechanic. The mechanic calls me to tell me that I have what they call a rod knock. Comes to find out that there are more then 1,500 complaints about how the engines seize for no reason on these cars and the manufacturer has not bothered to issue a safety recall. Now I am out of a car and I am the one that has to come up with 4,000 to fix there foul up that they have known about and have failed to address. Needless to say, I will not be paying to get this fixed and will be sending this car to the junk yard where it is belongs. Hyundai is screwing with peoples lives and almost got me killed. I do not appreciate this and I am sure other drivers on the highway would not appreciate to know that a Sontana can all of the sudden seize up without any damn warning."
"An amazing value  I bought this car, not really knowing what to expect.  It was four years old with 100,000 miles on it - just beyond the manufacturer's warranty.  With that many miles in that short period of time, I figured it was a road car.  I've put another 130,000 miles on the car in the last seven years with no major repairs needed to the vehicle.  I've changed the brakes twice. I've put new shocks on it. I've put two batteries in it.  Tire wear is normal; I'm on my second set. Amazing reliability for an unknown vehicle. The car is quiet on the road.  The six cylinder engine still has lots of pep and doesn't strain going over the mountains in my area. Transmission shifts reliably. I only have three minor complaints.  1) Shortly after I got the car, the windshield visors began falling down - a complaint that was the only one I found in my research before buying the car.  The dealer took care of these for about $250.  It was too much, but what are you going to do? 2) The selector controlling air flow direction is sluggish and always has been.  Sometimes it will switch from vents to feet (for heat), but it usually takes its time. 3) The antenna for the radio is sub-par. It's a windshield antenna; again, something I expect of this type of antenna."
"Great First Car  I've had this car for two years now and have had no issues with it. It has a sporty appearance that hides the age of the car well. It fits in great with the newer cars on the road. Acceleration is great (most of the time) and has a smooth ride overall. There is plenty of leg room for drivers and passengers making long drives comfortable. It has 155,000 miles and I'm sure it will run strong for a while longer. When I buy a new car, the only reason would be to have more technology (back up camera, Apple CarPlay, push button start, etc.) that cars from the 2000's didn't have. The base sound system is actually very good and has a lot of bass which is important to me. It sounds better than most newer cars sound systems. If I only drive on the highway, I can get 29 mpg, but mixed driving yields around 24. If you're looking for a great car that won't cost a lot to buy or maintain, this is the car for you."
"Do not buy this car  If you want a far a part car, buy this car, and spend as much to fix it, as you will pay for it, junk car, p a RTS are expensive, and there a fall a part car, good luck."
Great car for the money  Over 100K miles and still running great!
a car for all reasons  great ride;roomy;road warrior;low road noise.
"Mix bag  I bought this car almost three years ago.First owner was an old guy, so I think he didn't drive it too harsh.  during past three years I had to change the whole Starter package, whole AC compressor and accessories, front struts, windshield wipers water pump ( its broken again) and replaced the battery twice. CD player may work only occasionally and can not read half of the tracks for no good reason. I changed the front shock absorbers, and it just got a little better for a while,, its just driving me crazy that how noisy and uncomfortable the car is over small bumps. I took care of the car really good and still its not reliable. when I bought the car it had 93000 miles on it and now its ~ 117000. thats stupid,,, I won't ever but any Hyundai products and will not recommend it to anybody."
"Hyundai Changed My Whole Opinion On Their Cars  Very surprised with this vehicle. I was sketchy before I got this car because of Hyundai's previous reputation, but after driving it and owning it for a few months, I am very impressed. I want to start off with my absolute favorite thing about this car - it rides so incredibly smooth, and the road noise is minimal inside of the cabin. Seriously, the smoothness of the ride is right up there with GM's more luxurious brands (Buick, Cadillac). The acceleration is impressive (I have the 3.3L V6), and the breaking is great. Another thing I'd like to note is how great the overall visibility this vehicle provides. As for the interior, the layout of the radio, AC controls, and the car controls (turn signals, wipers, etc.) is pretty simple and easy to learn relatively quick. However, while I do enjoy the simplicity of the layout, I have to say I don't care for how basic this car is. I know it isn't the LX, but still, this car seriously lacks some features that other cars in its class (Accord and Camry) have. The backseat provides decent leg room and is somewhat roomy for the passengers. This car is 10 years old now, and I'm still impressed with the driving characteristics of this vehicle, and my opinion of Hyundai has absolutely changed."
No belt Chain for timing  We owned it since new 190000 still going of course you have to maintain where parts but if your looking for a used car I would recommend this year since it was built in USA plant I have the LX and I'm handy when it comes to doing my own repairs .
"Elvira  As soon as I got a glimpse of the 2006 Mustang GT I knew that I would have one, all I had to do was find one that was black on black. Well, that proved to be harder than anticipated. It took more than a year but we found a dealership that would allow us to build the car of our dreams. I picked Elvira up on Oct 2nd 2005 and she has been loved every day since. We drove her from Ohio to Florida in pouring rain without any trouble and surprising gas mileage. She is garage kept and stored as soon as snow threatens to fall. Our only complaint has been the cupholder position and trouble finding quality after market parts such as the shaker system that my husband suprised me with this past birthday"
"1st Mustang for the family  Moving to a Mustang has been an interesting experience.  This is the first Mustang our family has owned and we find that there is a lot of coveting of the cars from everyone.  I use it as a daily driver, and my commute is a joy covering 20 miles on some twisty country back roads.  There is very little we don't enjoy about the car.  That said, there are probably better interiors out there as well as fuel economy, but these shortcomings are more than compensated for when it comes to the overall experience of driving a proper American muscle car."
"This car is the stuff of nightmares.  I bought this car about 2 years ago from a guy whose grandparents who passed away and didn't want the car. I bought it with 63k miles on it. I'm now at 77k miles and EVERYTHING is breaking. Everything in this car rattles, so there are always noises. No matter how much money I put into this car to fix it, something else breaks. I've had to get new struts, motor mounts, hoses, headlights, door handles, a new motor for the wiper fluid, control arms, bushings, the rotors are about to go. I'm STILL having problems. I've taken great care of this car, but I can't seem to stop the breakage. I would not recommend this car to anyone."
"Very Dissapointed! Wanted a Reliable Beautiful car  Fell in love with my 2006 Sonata.  Beautiful metal-flake Cherry Coke color with beige interior and wood trim on dash. Looks very elegant. To date both front doors are peeling like crazy for NO reason....and any black paint ie: windshield wipers, posts between windows has faded dreadfully... looks terrible!  Have had several issues with the check engine light coming on. Have replaced modules, timing chain, tensioners, you name it. This car has been driven less than any vehicle I have owned and has been the worse for wear. When new you couldn't hear the car idle at all and now it just knocks all the time. Dealer is of little help..even told me all the re-call work had been done when I knew it had not.  Will not purchase another Hyundai...."
"Best Car I ever owned (Ten Year Original Owner)  Bought the car off the show room floor in North Los Angeles and drove it home 130 miles south to San Diego.  I t was a great trip.  New Car, New Car smell and acceleration galore.  Car is fast.  I moved to the mid south a year later and have been there ever since. Car is great in snow and ice.  Car has 175K miles and is still on original spark plugs.  Still on original transmission fluid and original radiator fluid.  I get an oil change religiously every 3000 miles (I think thats the secret to long life).  Car has had no major trouble.  I tow with it all the time. (5x8 utility trailer 1000 lbs not a problem).  Minor problems include: Sun Visor, brake pedal switch, rear 3rd brake lamp, replace headlamps 3 times, drivers window when wet and rear brake lamps bulbs.  I have driven the car at 130 miles an hour in the Southern California desert just to see if cruise control works at over 100 mph  (it does). Best Feature: Reliability. I would buy another but they don't offer that V-6 in a sonata,  It is available in the Santa Fe and it now produces almost 300 hp.  I like this brand and will stick with it.  They need to hurry up and make the Santa Cruz  cause I need a new vehicle...10 years time for a change.  And yes I will keep the old sonota as a second car until she dies."
"First car I got to drive: loved it!  This car is dependable. Our sonata is 10 years old and has seen its days, but still runs with a bit of noise and other issues. Nothing too major but there's so many issues that we are now buying a new vehicle. I will say this is hard to park because I took my driving test in it and always came close to the cones. If you know the car though parking is fine! I got to know my dads car. lol"
"10 years on....  I bought my black Sonata brand new on March 13, 2006.  It had just came off the truck and had all the plastic on the outside and inside.  They hadn't even checked the car in yet.  I drove the V6, but decided on the 4cyl and I have NEVER regretted that still after 10 years.  I have had no problems and this is my 3rd Hyundai.  2 previous were Elantras(99, & 04), which were trouble free as well.  I still love driving my car and nothing has ceased to work and it still like new even at 10 years old.  I only have 62,000 miles on it.  My family has a variety of makes of cars (Subaru, Honda, Toyota, Nissan) and I still love getting back into my car as the quality is just as good as the others and mine is older than any of theirs.  It shows how Hyundai just got it right with the 06 Sonata at the time.   I feel the newer ones may be better in areas where mine was ""lacking"", but there is something about the newer ones that I just don't like.  Im not sure if there are way more plastics than softer material on the inside or what.  Gas mileage is fantastic as well.  It never changes and I get pretty much the same each trip.  The best I got was  a 10 hr round trip to OC, MD and back at 600 miles to a tank of gas.  Yes, the gas light was on, but I still had 30 miles to empty reading on the computer.  How can you beat that.....I have never had really any issues with any of the Hyundai's that I have had, yet people still think these cars are not that great...If you maintain them and service them they will last just as long as any other...Interesting that people are starting to realize that Hyundais are competitive and really great cars...Something I new about the company for 16 years now since I've had my 99 Elantra."
"10 years on the road, still like new.  Bought this car new 10 years ago, when Hyundai still had a shady reputation... But I fell in love with the design, and took a chance.... This model of the Sonata was the FIRST really quality car coming from Hyundai, and it turned things around... Though I have only 55k on the odometer, the car rides like new, smooth, quiet, adequately powerful, stable, relaible, no problem. We have owned Accords as well, and I must admit there isn't much difference in built quality (but huge difference in price).... This is a good car."
"LOVE THIS CAR!!!  I bought this car 3 years ago with 60,000 miles on it. I now have 148,000 and still runs great. Front seats can be uncomfortable at times. Powerful V6 and fun to drive. Replaced the fuel pump at 127,000 miles, other than that, just brakes, rotors, tune up, oil change ect....got a aftermarket radio so I could have us plug in and aux cord plug in.  Get about 22mpg city and 26mpg highway."
"Almost 10 years in this thing  Overall, it's been a solid car with decent reliability.  It's solidly built and pretty quiet on the highway.  Gas mileage is middling, but it is a V6.  Power is decent for a family sedan.Pros:  Reliable, fairly quiet, inexpensive to maintainCons:  Interior is low rent.  For some reason, the suspension has started to squeak when going over any small bumps.  Hasn't affected handling.  May be due to the excessive dry heat (Phoenix az) we have here.  Have had to replace radiator hoses and one of the windshield washer nozzles (again probably due to the heat here).  Would I buy again?  Probably not.  But for reliable transportation at low cost with decent power, it's been a good purchase.  It's like a good mule, not a quarterhorse.UPDATE:  Well at this point any car is going to have problems.  The concerning one is that out of ever 10 starts, i have to struggle to get it to turn over 1 or 2 times.  I've replaced the key cylinder and it hasn't made a change in the problem.  It's probably a loose circuit somewhere but I've gone ahead and replaced this vehicle.  Overall it's been solid and dependable.  But not exciting.  At all."
"love this car  brought this car new in 2006 have been one of  the greatest , havent   had no major problems with it an have replace nothing but brakes, bulbs , so far got 342,000 miles on it now, still run like a champ love this car."
"Two engines since coming off the showroom floor in  All I can say is that this car had an electrical system right off the showroom floor. It has also had two engines. The first failed at less than 100,000 and the last one failed at 34,700. Support from the dealer was ok but Hyundai Motors showed nothing but contempt for us and treated us like dirt. Will never ever purchase any other Hyundai product again period. Please do yourself a favor and ask lots of questions and also talk to as many owners and research any car you purchase from these people before hand. The warranty sounds good but its a scam. They Hyundai Motors staff are cotemptabledisrespectful trolls."
My First Car  My parents bought this car for me for my first car. I am definitely a car person and was thrilled to get a Mustang. This car is so reliable. Every time I need to go somewhere I know that it will get me there safely. I also get excellent gas mileage. I usually get between 23 and 26 highway driving.If you take good care of your Mustang and treat it right you will not have any problems.
"Love it and Hate it  I have owned this car since 2011. It only had 7,000 miles when I purchased it. Obviously Grandma Moses owned it first! I love the ride, drive, and comfort of seats for rides lasting less than four hours. Anything over that and my back begins to hurt. The only thing I can actually say that I HATE about the car is the constant need to replace light bulbs. From headlight bulbs, break lights, and the bulbs over the license plate. Ugh!!! Many are easy to change and I've made my own way of changing them. Others... Not so much. Almost two hours to change the high mount bulb in the back window. Other than that I love it and will definitely buy another!!!"
"My 1996 Escort is Better   This 2006 Shoddyota, aka Sonata, was acquired in 2007 with 14,000 miles. PROBLEMS before 30,000 miles: $1,200 engine repair to replace shoddy timing chain tensioners. Poor quality engine component should have been recall but Hyundai shafted owners by cutting compensation to dealers for doing the repair under warranty, which was essentially negating their much touted warranty. Defective sun visors. More orange peel than my Escort. Escort also has spring loaded side view mirrors unlike Shoddyota. Cruise control stopped working. Glove box door had to be shimmed to prevent rattle. Wiper blades had to be downsized to prevent hopping. Poor city mileage. Hyundai can't even design a cup holder !!  "
"Value for A to B drivers  If you're looking for a car to get you from point A to point B that's reliable, cheap to own and decent looking, you've found the right car. If you're looking for handling, performance or fun, go somewhere else. Safe, reliable and cheap! Over 250,000km's and still going strong. No rust, heck, the car still looks new. It's never even been rustproofed and I live in Canada. "
"Buikd quality Misses  There are certain build quality issues with Hyundai and I believe that this was good first serious attempt to challenge Toyota and Honda. But the cup holders are horrible and should have never ever made it to production. What was hyundai thinking? One can only assume that Koreans think that every drink Americans have are supersized big gulfs? (they did address this with the 2010 updates). The Sunvisor breaking arm issue should have been a recall and not a TSB. The Sunvisor arm breaks and then comes down while you are driving, so I guess it's okay that the visor comes down and blocks your view causing an accident. And the final pet peeve are the break lig"
"230,000 mile road dog  I bought my Sonata in 07 with 22,000 miles (previous rental). Overall I have LOVED my car, very dependable! There have been some little issues with sensors going off along the way, but just annoyances. My car has a ton of highway time, it has been a commuter for the last five years and never let me down. The only major mechanical fix $400 alternator repair at 217,000 miles. Otherwise just brakes battery, oil, tire maintenance. I give the interior a little lower rating as the quality seems a bit too plastic and I have broken visors, cup holder, center console etc-but my car takes a beating. Interior just hasn't held up as well as I had hoped.Seats are a bit uncomfortable for long drive"
"2006 4 Cyl GLS  We bought this car 3 years ago for our daughter.It was a one owner, well cared for car with 90K miles.It now has 105K miles and has been good to us.I had the usual 90K mile service done when we first got the car (change fluids, belts, hoses) and all has been well.While the engine may be slightly less refined than my wife's camry, the build quality and fit and finish is better.I am a car guy a really like this car.The mass air flow recently failed but this is relatively minor and the car sits outside at college day after day and this may have had something to do with it.Mileage is good and would buy the car again."
"Warning: It costs $3,500 for a clutch job!  My clutch failed at only 85,000 miles (and half of those highway miles), and to my dismay I found that this car has a ""dual mass flywheel"" that can not be resurfaced and is ONLY AVAILABLE through Hyundai.  To fix the clutch AND replace the flywheel costs almost $4,000!!Update:  At 105,000 miles the car threw a rod and the engine was toast. It would have been another $4,000 to replace it so I gladly parted ways with this car - and with Hyundai FOREVER.I'll sound like a shill for saying it, but my mechanic literally told me that I should have bought a Honda.  I bought an Accord new in '94 and sold it (still running fine) after 12 years and 175,000 miles.  Since I drive 25,000 miles a year I need a good commuter car, so after the Sonata died I bought a '14 Civic new and am really happy with it.It's too late for me, but not for you."
"Outstanding value, power and handling  Our 2006 Hyundai Sonata LX has 68,000 miles. My wife used it for daily commuting for 5 years with an occasional road trip. We are both retired now and it is mostly used for road trips around Minnesota and one or two long trips to Arizona and other vacation spots. It is by far the best family car I have owned. I have it regularly serviced at our local Hyundai dealer and I have experienced only one minor issue with rear brakes. Otherwise...zero problems. It is a joy to drive on the highway or twisty back roads. I am on my second set of tires and brakes. This week I will replace the original battery. We fully intend to keep this car forever, God willing."
"Six Years and Still Happy Customer  Overall, I am VERY pleased with my 2006 Sonata LX.I purchased it new in 2006 and have had two minor warranty repairs, a power window malfunction and an ignition key issue.I change the oil and rotate the tires every 4M miles.I have about 55M miles on the car."
"Great Value, Great Car, Well Kept Secret  We bought our Sonata new in Pittsburgh.It's been a really fantastic vehicle.In 2006 they changed the body style, and it still looks fresh.We got the V6, and this car will really move.Mechanically we've had no issues, but we haven't hit the 60K mile mark yet.If you need a good second car, or a first car for a new driver, you won't regret buying one of these.Been fantastic.(I only hope it can go as long as my 2001 Jeep Cherokee - truly an awesome SUV if ever there were one). "
My Mustang gets 22.23 MPG over two years  My Mustang gets 22.23 MPG over two years. This is a fact. I've kept careful and accurate records. Regular gas. I don't remember which coupe I have. It's the anniversary issue. Red. I love it.
"2006 Hyundai Sonata LX V6   I dont understand... When I fill my tank up it says 350 miles to empty every time but the MPG estimator say 318.6 CITY /477.9 HIGHWAY. My Sonata has 31,000 miles on it and its 7 years old. After while the car becomes uncomfortable on long rides a hour or so into the drive. It's hard to take off from a red light without the wheels spinning causing a ruckus. The body roll is insane when turning at spends higher that 15mph. The 235 @ 6,000 RPM and the 226 lb-ft Torque @ 3,500 Torque RPM is to much for the front tires."
"So far sooo good.  Running on 76k miles now. All I did was oil change, battery change, tire change, filter change and belt change. Six years of owning this car ever since it was bought new, maintenance was minimal. I had a Mitsubishi 3000gt before, gave me all sorts of engine and transmission problems. I'm sticking with Hyundai. Call it luck or whatever it is, my car runs like a champ. Forgot to mention, when I was on the L.I.E(495) coming from Long Island to Queens, a Stony Brook student hit the rear of my car with his Saab. My bumper only had a minor paint chip while his entire front bumper and hood was crushed in. The impact was enough to tilt my head. Unfazed."
"2006 Hyundai Sonata LX V6 FWD Plush Ride not Firm  Lets make something clear the 2006-2010 Hyundai Sonata's are not sports cars, its more of a luxury car. It has a very smooth plush ride but the suspension is the worst. It's not a good car to cut corners fast in at all. A lot of body roll. It seems as if when taking off from a red light to a green light at full throttle the front wheels can't really handle the power the engine is giving off so it makes the wheels burn rubber on the pavement which I hate. The ESC kicks in very quick when on wet or slippy roads. I was driving and turned a left at a 15 degree angle at 20mph and the ESC did its job even though I didnt need it to save me at that time. It should have daytime running lights. "
"Love our Sonata!  We bought it in 2007 w/ 20K miles-it now has 100,000 miles and looks & runs great. Only had a couple of maintenance recalls & broken sun-visor covered under warranty. After warranty expired, one sensor went out, it was covered by our extended warranty. We have only replaced tires, oil, battery & brakes-NO OTHER MAINTENANCE! My husband commutes 75 miles daily & averages 26mpg on highway, 21 in town. It has great acceleration needed for freeway. We got a great car with many upscale features for a reasonable price. Liked this so much, we purchased a 2008 Hyundai Azera for the family car. We are passing this down to our daughter; it has great safety ratings & we trust it for her and her baby. "
"The 146mph Sonata  No, I haven't hit 146 but owners of this model may want to Googlethe title of my review.A rental was clocked doing that speed.However, I was going about 70 mph last month and unexpectedly came up on a large chunk of a truck tire in the middle of my lane. The Sonata handled like a Nascar vehicle. It reminded me of the first time I drove a Mercedes back in 1970.So far so good with this 6 year old vehicle, but it only has 29,000 miles.Depreciation isa factor with these cars, so you may want to look for a cream puff that is 1 or 2 yrs old if looking for a newer model. "
"Great car and great warranty!!!  I have owned my Hyundai Sonata for 4 years. It has been a great car ever since. The only issue I had was the visor broke, but they replaced it under warranty no questions asked. I love the way it drives and it's reliability. I would definately recommend it. I currently have 98,000 miles on it and trust it will go many more miles."
"Don't trust Hyundai Warranty  Despite all the claims by Hyundai on having a great warranty..the Hyundai commitment to service is not trust worthy..The general guideline to the dealership is avoid accepting the faults in the car..till the warranty runs out..Once its run out they start pointing out faults that you have always been asking them to repair... simply the Hyundai approach is to avoid acceptance of any fault in the cars..temporary fix the problem when customer insists or adamant. Buy it if you just want to keep it for 60, 000 miles..after that it is your risk..no matter how well you kept your car..it will haunt you! whatever was fixed once will break again!"
"Hyundai  Don't buy a Hyundai. The 06 Sonata is my 4thof 5 Hyundai's. At 74,000 miles the airbagwarning light came on. The dealer wants $1100to replace the seat sensor. Asked for assistance from Hyundai. No thanks,it's 15,000 miles out of warranty. Still has powertrain though. This is the second time i've asked Hyundai to repair a safetyissue out of the base warranty and the second time they've refused. That won't happen withToyota or Honda.So don't buy a Hyundai. When the cars age and safety issues happen,they will show you to the curb."
"Amazing Car  This car is amazing, we bought it brand new and I'm glad I bought it. This car has never let me down, the winters are tough around here and the car can handle it better than any other car we've ever owned, The backseat cupholder did break and the pouch in the rear seat ripped, but other than that it's in pretty good conditon for being a four year old car, not even any rust! I would so buy it again, it,s AWESOME!"
"Oh Hyundai...You've come a long way  This is my second Sonata, my first one was a 04.I have a LX with leather, and I must say, what an excellent car.. I'm beyond happy I bought his over a Accord. It's been a problem free car and rides like it's on clouds. My friends are amazed at the ride quality, how smooth and quite the 3.3 V6 is.It's not the fastest sedan out there, but it gets the job done.I really do like the styling of each Sonata generation, starting from 2002 and up. My Sonata is almost at 70K miles, and feels new.A teenager texting on his phone rear ended me, he had to be going 15-20mph, his air bags deployed, yet mine didn't (Thank god), and the best part is, there wasn't a dent on my bumper! Just a paint chip"
"love it  My parents got me this car for my first one, and let me say they shouldn't have it has way more horsepower then i need but i don't care i like it. It runs great is very smooth and sounds great. I love the white color it is just a great car. I want to keep it and give it to my son or daughter"
"5 years and still love my car  I have had my Sonata for 5 years now and still like the car very much.I wish it would have some of the newer features, but no big deal.Gas is a plus as well."
"Very Good Buy  I bought my 2006 Sonata LX in April of 2007. It had about 3,000 miles on it. Since then I've driven it nearly 35,000 miles. This car has performed well and has had very minimal problems. The ride is great and the acceleration is more than adequate. The only service I have done to it besides regular maintenance was: power mirror replacement(under warr.), brake light sensor (under warr.), passenger sun visor broke(under warr.). I also had to replace some air valve in the engine due to stink bugs crawling up inside it...ugh. Thats nothing against the car tho. Overall, I love this car and it's been very reliable. Would definately consider buying again!!"
"Excellent in Crash  We bought our Sonata used almost 2 years ago.  This past weekend, we were hit from behind, with the other person going around 70 mph.  My Sonata flipped end over end, landing on the top.  My daughter I both got out alive, and I believe my Sonata is the reason for this.  It was a very sturdy car, and I don't think we would have fared as well in another car its size."
"Best I've owned  With 5 years and 50,000 mi on my Sonata LX, I couldn't be happier. Only repair has been a sensor, under warranty. Good performance, good handling for a family-type sedan, comfortable. No problem with mileage - 19 around town, 27 highway.  "
"Very Happy  Ok so after looking at different cars I found this 06 Hyundai Sonata and right away just had to get it. it has 85,000+ miles and my friends don't believe me. the engine has enough power to throw you back in your seat under sharp acceleration using the Sport Shift option. some people think that its actually a brand new car. I love Subarus but even used they are way out of my budget. the stock audio system and sharp exterior styling has heads turning as I pull up to my college parking lot especially from girls. lol I never had that happen in my old 06 Chevy Equinox. I am definitely a loyal Subaru and Hyundai lover/owner."
"2006 Sonata GLS 6 cyl automatic  Turned 76K miles and pleased overall.  Excellent value for the quality.  Floor shift indicator lamp went out after warranty expired.  Have not bothered to have repaired.  Vehicle came with free oil change for life every 3500 miles.  However, when you add the extra charges associated there was little savings. Does not perform well in snow."
"Warranty Goes - BEWARE  Purchased new the same year as our Honda Civic.  Have put 74k miles in 5- years on Sonata, double that mileage on the Civic.  Sonata feels & drive like the older care.  Warranty is over on both. Civic runs like top.  But, Sonata always has Engine Warning lights on. Handles & seat belts are breaking, also fixed prior under warranty. Costs building like crazy on Sonata.  ESC has issues, dangerous loss of power occurs often.  Was repaired both in and out of warranty. Both of us wish we would have gone with a Honda Accord instead.  Sonata is cheaper. I got what I paid for.  "
"Sonata is awesome!  I bought my 06 GLS v6 used with 20k, I now have 103k on it. Stock rotors will warp, replace them with EBC rotors and Akebono pads HUGE improvement over OEM. I haven't had any problems, I've changed all fluids out. Only let down is fuel mileage, city driving not so good, highway driving has dropped too, avg is around 23-25, on the highway I can get around 26-30 depending on speed. If you do all city with V6 you will be in teens. For those griping about replacing strut mount bushing at 130k, LOL please thats a lot of miles stop whining. I wish I would have gone with the 4 cylinder seems fuel mileage is better and more consistent. "
"Very Pleased   I purchased this car used with 25k miles. I have 71k miles on it now after 1.5 years of ownership. Very pleased with my purchase.  Low cost of ownership - only performed routine maintenance. This is my commuter vehicle and spends most of it's time on the highway. Still enjoy looking at the exterior to this day. Looking at dollars and cents, it was a smart purchase for me and my young family. Plenty of space for things, especially when you consider all of the things you need to haul for young children."
"Great to start with  We bought our Hyundai when it was a year old.  We were well pleased with it until it hit about 35,000 miles.  We had 4 throttle body sensors replaced under warranty.  This was a tow to the dealership on each occasion. Luckily the tow was also covered under warranty.  However we had the 5 sensor replaced at 80,000 miles and this was on us.  Hyundai part only and the repair was $555.00.  At 75,000 miles the sun visors would not stay in the up position.  Even though this seems to be a common problem, Hyundai does not cover them under warranty.  The cost to replace was $307.  I drive my cars for years and close to 300,000 miles.  Never had this much problem with my supposedly poorly built US cars."
"don't listen to any discuraging adults  I am a 20 year old man. I bought a mustang last year just after my 19 birthday. I always wanted a mustang all my life.And when the day came that my parents let me make my own decisions i was the extremely happy. No matter what people say about mustangs and believe me i have heard them all The car is absolutely top notch. Insurance is not too bad and I the fuel economy is actually pretty good especially if you have a standard Use the same amount of gas as a v6 engine just as a hyundai tiburon V6 which i actually traded in for the stang. To sum it up: Car is great, fun to drive, good on gas, good car for a 18-25 year old due to insurance. Have fun you only get fora couple ofyears due to marige"
"Sonata Happy in Las Vegas  I purchased my 2006 Hyundai new from the dealership in June 2006 and can say that the vehicle has been a steady and dependable vehicle. The V6 provides plenty of power when needed and the interior/trim look well and continue to work without fail.  The valve cover gasket was replaced by the dealer under warranty at 55,000 miles - the only major repair to the vehicle. Otherwise, the car requires routine maintenance to keep it humming.  Like many, I purchased the Sonata because I did not have enough coin to spring for a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry. As I look back on it, purchasing the Sonata was a sound decision and I'll continue to drive it until the wheels fall off and I buy a new Sonata!"
"Five Years Without a Problem  We have put 70,000 miles on this car in five years and our only expenses have been gas, oil changes and a new set of tires. It still has its original breaks.  I drove it hard on a 1,500 mile interstate highway trip and averaged 33.1 mpg. When ethanol is added to the gas the mileage is not as good.  I thought it was odd that a four cylinder car would have a 150 MPH speedometer. After I had the car three years a friend asked me how fast it would go. I was on a country road and when it reached 122 mph I backed off, so I don't know what it will really do. Also, this was with ethanol in the tank.    "
"No sign of wear at 80,000 miles  I am almost at 80,000 miles on my Sonata and I still haven't had one problem.  Just had the car detailed and it looks great - almost no signs of wear.  This is right around the point where my Mercedes started having crazy electrical problems but I think my Hyundai will go until I want to replace it with something more fun.  The real debate is whether to sell it before it hits 100k miles or drive it into the ground - which could be years."
"Perfect no, but better than expected  I like this car.  It has been very dependable (65K no problems at all) and does everything I want it to do.  V6 is better than expected, smooth, quiet and peppy.  Not a screamer but I didn't pay for a race car.  One minor complaint is the tranny hesitates when it shifts from 1st to 2nd gear just slightly.  I was told this is normal, I don't buy it but it hasn't proved to be a problem.  Interior is functional and initial critiques questioned the durability of the cloth seats, well they were wrong, good stuff.  I bought this car to be functional and dependable, and it has been rock solid.  Yea the front end can float a little but it was not a BMW.  Bought with 14K for $13.5K.  Best car for $."
Fun to drive 2006  We have had ours 2 weeks and love this car so far. Excellent gas mileage fun to drive.
"Very reliable, annoying however...  Put 100,000 miles on it. Haven't had ANY mechanical problems, even after not changing the oil for up to 8-9000 miles at a time. Performed regular maintenance (brake pads, oil, filters, etc) and has never broke down once. The center console is terrible!!!! Too much to list here about it, but for instance.. The cup holders... well is really just one big cup holder, and if you have only one drink in there, it will definitely slide and spill into the gear selector. It is now hard to shift gears from the amount of times this has happened. Grey interior is now brown from dirt, even though I keep it clean.  Headlights are impossible to replace by yourself without daylight and lots of patience. "
2006 Hyundi  Not at all happy with this car since I picked it up from the dealer. It had pulsating on the brakes and a vibration while driving. This was on city streets. Had to go back twice to have the rotors turned and wheels balanced. Vibration was never fixed to my satisfaction for a new car and was told that there is nothing wrong. Washer pump failed at 120K Strut mount bushings had to be changed at 130K Head lights need to be replaced at least once a year and engine light comes on with no fault and needs to be reset. The initial cost is attractive but the resale value is not there so as far as I am concerned the cost of ownership is high. I will not buy another Hyundi. I have owned two Sonatas.
"No Problems but normal wear and Tear  I have over 110,000 miles and I have had not issues other than the normal wear and tear item.  Being a do it yourselfer I spent about 150 to change both control arms to get rid of an annoying squeak but other than that just the normal changing of bulbs, oil/filter and tires...."
Suprisingly Great Car  I enjoyed owning a Hyundai Sonata especially with its excellent warranty and comfort in it. The price was excellent for all that I got in the car.  The drive and gas efficiency was very good.
"Will always own a Hyuandai!  I purchased my Sonata when it had very low miles on it.  I had it for 3 1/2 years...until yesterday.  The most dependable car I ever owned.  My mpg in the city was 27.  I had no cons at all about this car.  After owning a Sonata that never gave me a single problem, I decided to stay with Hyundai and just down sized to an Elantra yesterday.  I know I will never be left stranded and can count on a high quality, dependable vehicle.  I highly recommend Hyundai to anyone looking to buy a car.  You will not be disappointed!"
Best of the Best  This is by far my favorite model of mustang. I've owned several years of the mustang almost every year from 84- 04 and this one takes the cake by far.
"Thanks for the Sonata  After owning a few nice but questionably built US cars, this Sonata model has restored my faith in car manufacture.  It's just beautifully designed and built.  It has a strong and confident engine.  The details are just so nicely thought out.  This is an unparalleled highway car.  Improvement I feel could be the ride as it's is a bit bouncy on city bumps and the gas mileage drops too much in the city.  Otherwise excellent excellent car.  Gorgeous refined looking exterior."
"Great car  After 58000 miles, it has turned out ot be a great investment. I looked at Lexus, Audi, Volvo and Nissan and found most of the same features and better power for over 10,000 less (if buying used, beat the depreciation). Perfect reliability. Only two complaints. The visor broke and won't stay in the back position and It would be nice to have a greater range of adjustability in the power seat. I will definitely buy again. My wife only averages about 21-23 MPG but the price difference is worth it."
"Great car under $20K  Bought this 06 Sonata brand new. Now it has 33K miles and no problems at all. Wife drives it to work every day and a family car for the week-ends. Engine is powerful and quiet. Interior and trunk are very spacious. ABS brakes and ESC work as designed. Highway mileage is great, city could be better. Overall great car under $20K with power sunroof, ABS, alloy wheels. Great job Hyundai, will definitely buy another Hyundai car or SUV in next couple of years. No wonder Hyundai's sales went up in this down car market while other car makers are suffering.    "
"Crashed Approved  This is my second review. Wife and daughter T-boned a lady driving a Saturn Outlook doing 50 MPH in our Sonata GLS, then spun out into a ditch.  Based on the damage our car was totaled.  The Sonata held up very well, all 4 doors would still open and the front end crumple zones took the impact very well.  I was very impressed with the safety of the vehicle, both wife and daughter walked away pretty much unharmed.  I would buy another Sonata based on this alone, including other features like the fun to drive, comfort and reliability factor.  BEST car on the market for the money, hands down."
Still happy after 3 years  Very attractive and reliable car.  Have put 36K miles on it in 3 years and have been very please with overall performance.  Only issues have been minor.  Has excellent power for a 4- banger and gets great mileage (esp on the open road).  Switch on power seat and a brake light switch have had to be replaced; other than that - nothing.  Only complaint is that the car sits so low to ground that it makes changing own oil a challenge.
"2006 Hyundai Sonata LX  6 cyl  I have an 06 Sonata with the 6 cylinder.  I have had one emission issue with the car at 70k miles (I had to pay for the repair).  I purchased my first set of tires at 68 k miles and I just had the brakes inspected @ 74 k and front and rear are at 75% new.  Besides the normal maintenance (bulbs, wiper blades), Ive had to repair under warranty the w/s wiper pump, and a couple of check engines until I had the gas cap thing down.  I love this car, so I bought my fifth Hyundai and second Sonata today.  The 06 car handles well, has great pick up and gives even more with the shift- tronic.  Plenty of drivers leg room with easy cabin controls.  Great braking and the ESC and multiple air bags a plus."
"Great Car  I have really enjoyed owning my Sonata GLS.The few problems with the car Hyundai covered the costs of repair under their 5 yrs/60,000 mile warranty. And they extended that warranty by 2 yrs/24000 miles because of the horse power class action.The car is quiet, rides smoothly and is a good size, not to big, but carries four adults in comfort.I added after market leather interior, and wood trim for the dash, door/arm rest.And Chrome TSW 16 inch wheels, looks great with the bright silver paint.I have 76000 miles on my car. I am the second owner of this vehicle, I bought the car with 9,000 miles on the odo.Still after nine years of ownership I still really love driving my Sonata."
"My hyundai  Well. i got my hyundai sonata from this man who said he bought it from a lady who had it for years, APPARENTLY, she didn't take care of it. I end up getting spark plugs, diff. fuel lines, fuel pump, catalytic converter and many tires. Paint is fading. Transmission is slipping. got my bushings & tie rod replaced on the passenger side, JUST A LOT. luckily i didn't have to pay for anything but the fuel pump (: STILL A LOT OF WORK. I'm ready to switch cars."
"safety hazard  I bought used, while driving I would smell gas, so I popped the hood on inspection I saw that the fuel line that run to the fuel rail was leaking gas, I went to the junk yard to get one but the car I inspected had the same problem. I then had to pay $110 for a new line which is a foot long, the pully separated, paint fades on the hood, trunk and roof and front Windows are broken also inside the trunk were the spare tire goes is all roten out. Just like all the people who has had problem with this car I Wonder how do these cars past inspection. I called hyundia and informed of the problem ""I am just glad the car did not blow up on me""so to all those who is thinking buying a Hyundai don't."
"Hunk of Junk  This car has had the following parts replaced. Sun roof motors(2X), Drivers side window(2X), Antenna Motor, Pwr stearing hose busted, Breaks and rotors every 27,000(3X),Transmission Seals, Every sensor under the hood, the oxy.sensor(3X)They said that doesn't qualify for lemon law. It has to break 4X. The Radio, The Battery died in 03. the exhaust rotted out - they wanted 1500.00 to replace that. The car now has 90,000 Mi. My mechanic told me that I need a new motor. Hyundai will not replace the motor because we are not the Original Owners. DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR BUY A FORD !!! "
"I've Had a Better Mustang   I had a 1996 GT that could run circles around this one but some jerk totaled my parked car that only had 68k miles on it. So I bought the '04 V6. Wow, does it handle differently! The power is definitely less, and the GT cornered like it was on rails. The GT also had a rear stablizing bar and wider tires for much better traction in the rain and snow.  The '04 gets excellent gas mileage (from Philadelphia to Connecticut on 3/4 a tank) and is very reliable (except the CD player). "
"Cheap price = cheap stuff  I bought my Sonata in 2006 at 38K. Since then, I've only had problems. I fixed most of them myself, but someone who can't would have spent a lot on those repairs. I'm only at 90K now and I changed the transmission, the alternator, spark plugs and spark plug wires (all of them 2 times), both windows motors, 2 suspension, suspension bushings, catalyser (it was under warranty, it's a 2500$ part), changed 3 wheel bearings, changed the battery, alternator strap, the wholes gas and break pipes under car, gas filter, and a lot more. I just received a letter (we're in middle 2009 now) from Hyundai. It is a re-call for the subframe, it has to be replaced because it is dangerous. Manufacture problems."
"Very Dependable Vehicle  I've had this vehicle for approximately 9 years and it has been a good value for the money.  I've never had any problems with it and will definitely buy another one when the time comes.  The only drawback that I can think of is the manual shift, 4 cylinder doesn't have much power. Other than that, I love the car.   "
"A realistic evaluation  We purchased this car when gas was expensive. It is very similar in size and displacements to our '99 Camry. This car is not a Camry, but is still a good solid car. A lot of the reviews of people really don't seem to understand that owning a car involves some preventative up-keep. I've had to have timing belts and brakes on both. Toyota Camry is the GOLD standard. But that isn't to say the Sonota isn't a good, solid vehicle. (It's probably not fair to compare the two. I've heard the new Sonata's are closer in feel to a Camry.) I would have no reservations buying one. The car is very similar in ergonomics, design, and power to my old '96 Accord. Thanks for reading."
"The 4 Cyl. needed smoother shifting.  I find that my Sonata doesn't shift smoothly between gears. The car is a great value in general. I have 58000 mi. on mine and it's still going strong. The Silver color paint is peeling, which isn't too great, and I garage it every night and use it just for pleasure.     "
"waste money for a 35k miles 2000 sedan  I bought this car from a first owner, then I lost the 100k miles warranty. Rear wheel bearing, left front shaft, oxygen sensor, mass air flow sensor, tps sensor, front disc breakes worn out at 45k miles too much money to spend for a 70k miles car. Speed transmision sensor dealer said $500 plus 105 diagnostic fee. Crazy waste money.  I drove this car by 20k miles and I have been spended at least 1500 dollars in parts and labor. So the fabricants are supposed to put some recalls for this car. The people who knows about cars doesn't recomend me Hyundai or kia any more. I don't understand how a company advertise 100k miles warranty for this car."
2000 Hyundai Sonota sub frame rot  I bought this car with 11000 miles on it. Overall it has been pretty reliable until about 75000 miles I have had to replace all the wheel bearings. Now at 86000 miles the sub-frame is rotted from the inside out. This is the first time I have ever seen a sub frame rot on a vehicle less than 14 years old. It is a shame that Hyundai will build a car that the sub frame rots from the inside out. This is very dangerous and costly to repair. 
Good car for the price range  We purchased our car in 2002 with 50000 miles on it. We haven't had any major problems with it. The engine still has lots of pep after 78000 miles and the AC is ice cold. Our Sonata has tons of features that other cars in it's price range can't touch. The interior feels classy and it rides smooth. It has been a great car for us.
Just another review...  I am happy with my purchase decision.  It has been a good car for the money paid.  It has provided a good value.
"Engine Lights, all over the place!  I bought this car used 2 years ago, was told the title was clean, and right at 60K miles. Drove very well for about a year, and then the engine light came on. Powertrain, I thought! That covers engines. Wrong! Car had been salvaged, seller lied, and Hyundai won't honor the warranty. We learned a lesson. Spark plugs, wiring all needed to be replaced ($600- $650).  Now, 3 months after we got that fixed, the engine light is on AGAIN.  I'm sure it did this crap to the previous owner as well, which is probably why they totaled it in the first place."
"Worth the price  I bought the car @ 64K from my sister, the original owner.  I really had no major problems with this car until about 128K, and even in the past 3K miles I've had to replace (the original!) timing belt, serpentine belt, upper ball joint and crankshaft pulley (which I think was mechanics fault)  I had several things replaced by the warranty, no problems-the most major one was the alternator.  I think that the transmission is starting to go, and the performance has dropped a lot now, but @ 131K for a less expensive sedan, I don't think it's that bad.  Up until 125K I absolutely adored this car, worry-free. "
"Bang For My Buck!  I shopped around for about 3 months and wanted another Cobra, But found this jewel, my silver GT! This car is immacculate! It has no dings or dents and handles as good as my 1997 Cobra which was the year they made only 5000. My GT is a 40th anniversary with black leather interior, excellent condition followed by a powerful 4.6 liter V8, it handles so good and sounds like the awesome Mustang it is!"
"Its a  Korean Miracle  When you ride on a Sonata 2000 is a big change from the predecesor models. It runs soft and quiet.  One thing of many I like most is the fuel efficiency on road, specially on this times of high fuel prices."
"Low Expectations to Begin With  Purchased for only $15k, so expectations were low.  Few problems first couple years, little by little minor things started to break (visor, carpet clips, plastic covers for seat belts, trunk console hinge, pwr window components, door lock, exterior handle, etc.)  With 55,000 miles, tires wore out, front brakes and rotors...not bad at all.  At 58,000 miles, rear wheel bearing goes....mech inspected others and they are ok for now. $250 for repair.  All and all, not bad in terms of how much I am spending, I'm just amazed at how many things have failed on the car.  I hear the newer models are made better....can't cost that much to make plastic components thicker to prevent breaking, etc."
"That darn ABS/TCS light!  ABS/TCS lamp comes on in damp wheather (when you really need the TCS). Dealership can't figure it out. Trans has blow in & out speed sensors (seperately) and neither was covered under warrenty ($200 a pop!). Trans blew internal solenoid. Dealer repaired under warrenty minus $$ for trani flush. ""Intelligent"" transmission is actually pretty dumb. Shifting is usually sluggish and its gear choice bogs the engine down too much. Front grill design...is pretty absent. ...Looks like that guy didn't show up for work that day.    "
"Waste of Money!!!  I bought this car from my brother less than a year age, it doesn't even have 80,000 miles on it yet and the sub-frame has rotted out and has become undrivable.  I don't understand how a car company can get away with using material that can get rotted out so quickly and pose a hazard to the people's safety like that.  I have had older cars that did not have these problems.  On top of that I am having transmissions problems with it as well and my power window motor is fried.  If I knew then what I know now I would have not bought the piece of junk.  Hyundai should be ashamed and I am glad that I did not get in an accident with my children in the car due to this problem."
I'm disappointed!!  i bought this car brand new.had no problems with it. bought another car and gave it to my daughter 1.5 yrs ago. she had the tires changed and found a huge hole in the subframe rusted from the inside out.  the car has 106000 miles and Hyundai will not fix it.  i have never heard of a 6 year old car frame rusting through in half. my daugher could have been killed.  i trusted my Hyundai. it is definitely a faulty parts problem.
"Stay away.  I bought this piece of junk in 2002 from the original owner at 11K miles.  It started troubling a week after the purchase, from the minor power window break.  Then I had to visit dealership about 10 times to fix the symptoms from check engine light to stall on the road.  4 months after new car warranty expired, it now refuses to accelerate, which was fixed 2 years ago.  Don't believe Hyundai's good rating.  I believe you would regret if you did. "
"I LOVE MY 2000 SONATA!  Original owner of 4cyl 5-spd model and get 32/45 mpg after 5 years/68,000! Interior is roomy & comfortable for long road trips; handling is agile; a/c is ice-cold. Timing belt tensioner failed when I was thousands of miles from home, but dealership in Buffalo, NY quickly took care of it under warranty and put us back on the road to finish our vacation trip same day. Local Houston dealer has handled recalls and other warranty matters very well. Price & warranty got me to try it (always a Toyota buyer before).  I'd buy another Sonata & have recommended to others!"
"Never ending problem car  Unfortunately, I bought the cae used, so I didn't get the 100,000 mile warranty. At 50,000 miles driver's window mechanism went.  I have since replaced all wheel bearings once and now a second on the rear, after only 25000 miles. There were no lugnuts for the spare donut tire. The capped lugnuts wont work.  now at 100,000+ miles the car is always in the shop for various transmission and engine sensors.     I have driven cars almost 200000 miles and never have replaced wheel bearings. This model should have been on a recall list. While the car drives and handles well, mechanically it is a piece of junk.  The government should not allow vehicles like this into the country. "
"Will Never Buy a Hyundai Again  :)  I have had problems with this car from the minute I drove it off the lot. Discovered an oil consumption problem  when there was no oil in the car after  1000 miles.According to Hyundai specs it is acceptable to burn a quart of oil per 1000 miles in a new car. I tried to get them to fix this problem under the warrrany but they refused. I was very dissappointed in the corp. They finally admitted and fixed the problem at 60,000m when in the shop (for another problem) it was discovered that the piston ring gaps were lined up. Also numerous power window problems, wheel bearings, new catalytic converter,check engine light constantly coming on. Have had enough it is time for this car to go! "
impressions after 4 months  No problems encountered so far; the only negative thing for me personally is the reputation these Korean cars have.
"My Little Pony  I got this car last year with only 23,000 miles on it. I love this car. It's a 40th anniversary edition. I love it. I only travel from work to home and that's about a 5 minute drive for me. It runs well. Never had a problem. It's just a beautiful car. I like this car better than the newer models. "
"Beware of 2000 Hyundai Sonata  I had transmission replaced the first year I 
purchased the car when it would skip by the second 
gear. The transmission again was replaced in year 3 
and again in year 4. The 10 year warranty was the 
main selling point when I purchased the Sonata, but 
I don't think it would've lasted that long. Thank God 
I got rid of it before the five year comprehensive 
expired."
"Warranty Issues  Please who ever may read this. Be
extreamly Cautious to the Warranty in
which Hyundai offeres. Beware that THEY
chose whether to honnor the Warranty!!!
I have less than 80,000 miles on my car
and the engine blew. I've have had to

"Steaming in the South...  I liked this car at first, then at 
66,00 miles , just out of warranty, it 
broke down.  I paid for a new crankshaft
($975.00),then after two weeks, it 
broke down again, new timer belt, timer
($500.00), after three weeks it wasn't 
running again, this time it was a 
pulley (449.00, $300 just for the 
mechanic to tap the bolts back into the 
engine block!) The cassette player 
broke after warranty expired, and paint 
started chipping off the sides, and I 
live in the South. The sonata still

odometer. This has been the most 
reliable car I have owned to date. I 
would recommend this model if you are 
in the market. "
"40th year for Mustang  Has very peppy accelleration, good braking if not great, handles like it's on rails, has fiberglass Deck-lid and hood and rear spoiler, 16"" aluminum wheels. I did install a dual exhaust system with dual catalyst 2"" pipes and my gas mileage went up by 3-MPG city and almost 7-mpg hwy. No joke it made a big difference, with the factory style headers it has always been dependable, never let us down.. and at 26-28 mpg hwy. I'm a happy camper, And I would for sure buy another one when this one is worn out. Great little sporty car!"
"Very Satisfied  I have owned this vehicle for almost 4 
years and have had zero problems.  The 
only money I have spent on it has been 
routine maintenance.  I enjoy driving 
it, and Hyundai (or my dealer) even 
covered fixing the heater fan even 
though it was broken because a mouse 
built a nest in it."
"Pretty decent car, good value...  I am a satisfied Hyundai Sonata GLS V6 
owner. Good value at purchase and also 
had a 0.9% APR in March 2000. Now about 
the car - seems well built, and there 
have been very few problems. It is now 
approaching 60,000 miles and I have 
only had to take it in to the dealer 
three times. Twice for recalls and once 
for a warranty issue related to the 
keyless entry and power windows. Runs 
well, feels solidly built, has decent 
power, reasonably quiet even at high 
speeds. Adaptive transmission drops the 
ball sometimes and shifts roughly, but 
otherwise there do not seem to be any 
engine or transmission problems yet. 
Front brakes replaced at 57,000 miles."
"wheel barings  It's been a good car for the money.  
However, with less than 25,ooo miles on 
the car, and not quite 3 years old, 
both back wheel barings had to be 
replaced. 
  I treat this car with kid gloves. NO 
wear and tear.  This would indicate a 
manufactoring problem.  And a dangerous 
one at that.
  It is a good solid ride, and I enjoy 
the car. The Hyundai towing service is 
excellent.  They picked up my car in a 
matter of minutes and towed it to the 
nearest dealership to be repaired.  The 
towing, and work on the car were free."

spontaneously caught fire for no

Incredible drive  I bought my Mustang new and right away I installed slp loudmouths and a K&N aircharger. I love this car. It's never a dull moment driving it. Just when you think you have it figured out it reminds you it has more when it slams you in the seat while spinning the tires.
Best Car  I have had my car for about a year now and I love it. I have not had a single problem with it. I even drove it through the winter and I manage well. Driving slow and having a good pair of snow tires really makes a difference. Overall the car is amazing and I love it.

"1st new car  When we bought this car we wanted 
something more roomy than a compact 
yet still somewhat economical.  We 
were impressed with the ride, handling 
and especially the warranty. The only 
regret (besides buying new) was 
selecting the 4cyl, 5 spd combo. While 
the manual is fun to drive, it gets 
old in town.  The car has pep for a 4 
cyl, but not quite enough to gamble 
with.  The combination of the two 
proved almost deadly on one occasion.  
My advice to anybody buying a new 
Sonata, Get exactly what you want 
first time around because you'll lose 
tons of money trying to trade it in.  
Maybe someday Hyundai will have a 
better trade in value. It's a good car 
to KEEP."
"GLS V6 with leather is not a bad value  The ride has seemed to have gotten 
firmer along with more wind noise since 
I've had it.  Bumps in the road are 
very evident. It was kind of loud in 
the cabin to begin with but it's gotten 
worse as time goes by.  Sometimes when 
it's very cold, the windows won't roll 
down. They fog up constantly if it's 
rainy, or snowy  and/or cold.  The 
heater MUST be set on just defrsoting 
the windshield or all the windows will 
fog up. That's a real flaw. The only 
things I've had to do is replace 
the ""rear wheel"" bearings and I've had 
to replace both front headlights. The 
only thing it's missing is a Moon Roof."
"2000 Sonata, good for the money  We've beem pleased with the car.  So 
far (we've driven it about 14,000 
miles) the car has been great.  The car 
drives well, has upscale features, and 
no maintenance problems so far.  There 
have been several manufacturer recalls 
and the Renton dealership has been good 
to work with."

huge payment to go with it.  We 
searched and found this.  I'm a

"I Don't Like My Sonata  I will be taking my Sonata back to the dealer for the 4th time (only 17,000 miles as of 4/2/02) to have them see if they can fix the squealing/sqeaking noise they make every time I step on the brake. I'm tired of hearing from the service department that this noise ""is the nature of the Sonata"" I've already written and e-mailed Hyundai Motors Corp."
"Twice is to much  Transmission went at 78,000. The 2nd Hyundai Transmission to go. Have a 96 Accent & also lost a transmission after the 60,000 mile warranty. Just $2000.

You could not get a decent trade on a Hyundai if your life depended on it. Most don't even want a used Hyundai on their lot. Give it away or drive it until it drops."

"Very pleased  My wife and I have owned our GLS for 2 years now.  We have had absolutely no problems.  We are very pleased, to say the least.  We were looking at the Camry and Accord, but opted for the Sonata.  We could not be happier."
"It Stinks  The car was ok until it hit 1800 miles. Then a fuel injector problem caused it to shut off while driving at highway speed. A couple of months later, there was a huge puddle of transmission fluid on the garage floor thanks to a faulty rear transmission seal.  So I get that fixed only to have the battery go dead a few weeks later.  As of this date, the battery has gone dead 5 times and the problem is still not fixed.  The dealership has replaced the alternator on one visit.  On another visit they replaced the radio and the amplifiers for the MACH 460 sound system.  On the 3 other visits they say ""can't duplicate concern"".  Ford = Fix Or Repair Daily.  "
"Worth a look  Never owned a Hyundai in my life. Steep discounts and lots of features finally had me take a look. I really like the car. It’s not exactly eye catching, it doesn’t stand out from the crowd. The interior is very modern  and well thought out. The acceleration is great! Sport mode is a thrill but the gas just drains like water. In all honesty I’m not impressed with the fuel economy but I’ve owned smaller cars up to this point so hard to compare. Getting into a comfortable seat position took some time. It does have a rental care feel to it at times. The seats stain easy, the brakes are firm but a bit mushy in my opinion. The whole car is thrown forward when it stops, that’s because of the weight. The trunk is absolutely useless - by far the most annoying draw back of the car."
"Best car for the money  I have had the entry level 2017 SE for about 15 months now and have 43,000 miles on it already. I drive a lot, I needed a car that would be comfortable, reliable and provide good gas mileage. I simply love this car... My wife has the 2017 elantra with the tech package, I wish that I had bought mine with the tech package. Even without the tech package I still had android auto and it is just awesome.The good news is 2018 sonata seems to have blind spot detector as a standard feature. However, the car is simply great. It is very quiet and comfortable. I did test drive a Camry before buying this car, the camry did seem slightly quieter and a little softer but that did not justify the price differential for me. I get about 36 mpg on my regular 50 mile commute. I love that the tank is big and I get a whopping 600 miles before I have to fill in the gas. The materials quality surpassed my expectation for this price point. The interior is roomy and tastefully designed.  Only two things about this car bothers me. 1) there is no way to turn off the small white LED ambient light next to the sunglass holder. It bothered me a lot in the beginning but now I hardly notice it. 2) when I let go of the brakes from a complete stop sometimes there is a slight shudder/vibration felt (I don't believe my car has the stop start functionality). In the beginning I was worried but my wife's elantra does the same and hasn't caused any issues. The plan is to drive this vehicle till I see 300,000 miles on the odometer."
"How Hyundai has let me down.  In June of 2017, I took in my 2012 Hyundai Sonata for an oil change at the Hyundai Dealership in Coconut Creek and I ended up purchasing a brand new 2017 Sonata Sport, mostly because I really liked the Android Auto feature (a feature that connects your phone to your car and permits you to use your phone while driving through voice activation) and I felt pressured by the salesman. I had a Samsung Galaxy S7 which worked perfectly with my car for almost 9 months with no hiccups. About a month ago, my Android Auto begun disconnecting randomly, sometimes while I’m driving, far away from home, completely dependent on my GPS and the synchronization between my 2017 Hyundai Sonata Sport and my Samsung Galaxy S7 would abruptly end, forcing me to disconnect the USB cable, unlock the phone, turn the Bluetooth off, sometimes restart the handset (all while driving) in hopes that it would work when I reconnect. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gotten lost or missed turns. I begun receiving warning message on my phone stating that the software in the car was not compatible with my phone and that it needed to be updated, so I dropped my car off at the dealership, told them about the issue and expected when I pick up the vehicle later that day, that the problem would have been resolved. Boy was I wrong. The person who serviced my car, put a note in there stating that his phone connected and that it works. Obviously, when I get in and connect the phone, it connects, its randomly after some time the connection breaks and this foolishness begins. So, I reached out to Hyundai so basically told me that I need to use an old phone if I want my car to work. I have to use a Galaxy 6S, iPhone s6 or older. Well I almost $hit myself. They’re got to be kidding right? I decided, maybe it’s a problem with my phone, because my phone begun freezing each time I disconnected it from the car, so last week I spent $750 and bought myself a Samsung Galaxy S9 and I was so excited thinking ‘finally, my car will work like it ought to again’. NOPE! It worked with the brand-new phone for 20 minutes before reverting to the same issue. In addition, there’s a notification on the screen in the car that blinks continuously saying ‘reading USB’ followed by ‘Unable to connect’. Don’t even get me started on the time my trunk lock stopped working while I was moving into a new apartment and all my stuff got locked in the trunk or the fact that I can’t pump more than 4 dollars worth of gas without having the pump stop and having to just hold the lever on the gas pump down until I assume my tank is filled to avoid spillage. I am beyond frustrated and angry. At this point the car was not worth wasting this much money over. I wish I never bought it, should have stuck with my 2012 Sonata, never had any issues with that one. They refuse to fix it, they don’t know how to. I’m really disappointed and wish there was a way to get them to take the car back if they can’t repair the 1 feature for which I purchased the car. Don’t waste your time, effort or money guys, trust me, the stress is NOT worth it."
"Suprisingly Sporty  We just bought the SE model from a rental car sale company, although I can hardly tell it is not new. It accelerates so quietly and quickly that you have to watch your speedometer. We had rented this same model two years back for a little road trip and were really impressed with the comfort for four adults, three who are tall. We took it on winding mountain roads and to narrow coastal lanes and it handled perfectly. The interior is attractive and the electronics interface is friendly and not annoying. I love driving this car."
More than Great  I love my Sonata and can't believe all the features that it offers at a very modest price.  I have had it for over a year and have never had anything to complain about.  A great car at an ever greater price.
"Big Dissappointmnet  I bought a 2017 Sonata Sport back in April. Two months after getting it, it began to give me problems. First, instead of going into reverse it would go forward. Something unusual for a brand new car. Second, while I was trying to park and go to reverse the shifter got stuck, and the lights that turn on next to the shifter turned off, so did the camera and the screen at the front. I couldn't move the car at all because the break was also stuck. This happened 5 months after getting it. Now, I'm in the situation where the car decelerates, similar to pressing the break, while on the highway and having all the lights next to the shifter turn off and the screen in the front. Surely I was not expecting to have so many problems with a brand new car. If I could I would give this car a negative 100. This is the worst purchase I've made. And the dealer doesn't even know whats wrong with the car. This is not only a car issue but as well a safety issue. I left my old car for a new because it was causing me problems and now I'm back to square one. I must definitely DO NOT recommend this car to anyone. It might just be bad luck, but I will not rely on this company ever again."
My first black car  This is my 3 Hyundai.  I wouldn’t even consider another car.  The warranty is fabulous. The car rides like a dream!
Great car  The style is still eye catching and I love it
"Great Value & Reliable  I bought the Sonata SE back in May 2017. The car now has 11,000 miles and has been a real pleasure to own and drive every day. I recently went on a day trip to the Missouri State Fair and had two friends in the car. Cruising on I-70 at avg speeds of 80 mph and on several occasions over 100 mph, neither passenger even noticed the high speed. Of course I was pacing a few other cars that were also speeding so it seemed like I was merely driving with the flow. But the fact that this car was so quiet and so smooth ...well let's just say I am favorably impressed. Hyundai did a great job on this one!"
"worst quality of tires possible  Within 5 months and 5000 miles of purchasing a new 2017 Hyundai Sonata, I had to replace 3 tires. With minimal or jerk or hitting the curb, the tires burst. If you think I drive poor, for a comparison, I have been driving a Rav4 for 25000 miles and still have excellent quality of tires in it. I'm done with Hyundai vehicles, I cannot drive in constant fear that when my next tire is going to burst. I'm really scared of going on highways on high speeds or take my family out in this car. I'm replacing this car as soon as I can."
"40th Anniversary Special  Good on the road, parking, and looks.  Would buy another one."
Best value in town  Got this one after comparing to others in the market. Was able to add several promos on top of each other to get really good price for this car. Value wise this is way ahead of others...
"ECO Sorta  Expect an ECO to have mid-level trim. Very few options available. That was OK by me. I didn't even buy it for the extra gas mileage. I chose this model because for some reason (I'll tell you more in a minute) it was the quickest Sonata of all the trim models. If you check the specs you'll see a few clever things Hyundai did. Smaller diameter ECO tires (still pretty sticky), wider front track, reduced weight, a 7-speed auto transmission, and best of all a twin-scroll turbocharger on its 1.6L 4-cyl engine. All these combine to make it torquey and quick to get power to the road. Hot-rod? No. But definitely a satisfying driving experience from a mid-size car. It's a little hard to control your accelerator precisely at low speeds but put it in Sport Mode and find a twisty road to be reminded what driving fun is.OK, 6,000 miles later everything previous is still true. The only odd thing I've noticed is hard acceleration from a stop has the transmission in 1st gear longer than seems ideal. In casual driving with 4 large occupants the torque is very satisfying. No laboring to accelerate. Nice drive. Highly recommend."
"A really nice car !!  I bought a 2017 Hyundai Sonata 2.0T and i am so glad I did . The car looks from the outside , rides really well especially in sport mode. Has a big back seat and is very quite on the  road. As far as acceleration, you need to put in in normal or sport ..not ECO . Economy is when you are on the highway cruising . This car look better than the other mid -size sedans and the value for the money is awesome . I bought this car for $20,300 plus taxes ...Its was $26,400 MSRP!!!That is a great value and it has a 10 year warranty . You really cant go wrong with the turbo , it has enough power , good highway mileage ( 36 average) and is a good looking car .."
"Beeping Blind Spot  Bought this car because it doesn't just light up, but beeps when a car enters your blind spot, as you try to change lanes.  An essential for us ""active adults"""
"Awesome Car - A Family Car/Luxury/Sporty combo  I bought my car certified preowned (CPO)  just 2 months old and with just 1,498 miles on it. It still was in showroom condition inside and out and still had that new car smell. I was so happy to find this car while checking Mike Morgan's Hyundai dealership inventory online. I still can't believe I was lucky enough to get such a great deal on a like-new Hyundai Sonata 2.0 Turbo Limited fully loaded - because some doctor had traded it in because he decided he wanted a truck. This was perfect for me because I was able to afford it without going over my budget or having to resort to a lower trim.Some expert reviews call the interior and exterior of the Azera refined, while they refer that very similar styling for the Sonata bland. Well, I like the upscale conservative and refined exterior styling of the Sonata's exterior and I like the German-style layout and touch of luxury that the Hyundai Sonata 2.0 Turbo Limited exudes. The exterior has the distinctive quad exhaust chrome tips, as well as a sleek swooping design along the top of the car with a lip spoiler and rear diffuser. The front grill, chrome accents, stylish headlights, side rocker panels, and low bumper clearance gives the car an almost aggressive (I mean business) appearance. The interior is plush with leather seats and soft touch plastics. The center stack for controlling the electronics is laid out thoughtfully for the driver's full control. The whole plethora of electronic gadgets is just amazing. I like the pep that the car has even in Eco mode for passing or getting on the highway, and it does save gas. I am surprised how sneaky and quietly the Hyundai Sonata 2.0 Turbo Limited can get up and pass the speed limit and far ahead of all the other traffic almost before you notice it while in just in Normal mode. Most of the time I have to stay out of the Sport mode to avoid getting ticketed because of my lead foot. Of course the Sonata is not a true sports car, it was designed to be mostly a family car. It does have a dash of luxury and sporty pep to a very comfortable and quite family car. Because of the low sports car bumper clearance you will have to get use to avoiding parking spots with concrete wheel blocks. I judge the distance away from these wheel blocks by sighting them with the bottom of my driver's side mirror. It takes some getting use to but it can keep you from damaging your beautiful car's bumper. I still can't believe I am driving and own such an awesome car. The panoramic moon roof cools me off after jogging without using my a/c. I like the driver's and passenger seats that are powered for adjusting up, down, as well as back and forward; they are also heated, and cooled. I also like that the driver's side mirrors and passenger side mirrors are heated and powered for adjusting. The adaptive cruise control, cross traffic alert, lane assists, abs, traction control, blind spot detection, and backup camera help me keep safe on the road. The unsurpassed Hyundai warranties, proven reliability and durability are more reason I wanted and value my Sonata so much. I have only owned my car for five months and I can truthfully say this is the first car I have really loved."
"LOUD  chattering, ticking, and groaning engine  I purchased the 2017 Sonata in February; the car had 5 miles on it when I drove off the lot. At 150 miles, the engine became loud, especially upon starting up when cold. The engine chatters and vibrates and seemed extremely loud for a new car. The engine block also had corrosion spots on it. I took the car into the dealer and the service reps kept it overnight, told me they checked it out and there was nothing wrong, and they cleaned off the corrosion nad told me that was nothing to be concerned with. At around 300 miles, I discovered a defect in the passenger window and took the car back into the dealer. I again told them about the loud noise and that is did not sound normal; the engine knocks and certainly does not sound like a brand new car. They checked it out again and told me the noises are ""normal"" and that there is nothing wrong with the car. And of course they told me not to worry because if there is anything wrong, it's covered by the warranty. My car now has just now reached 3000 miles and I will be taking it in the for oil change. The engine seems to be louder; I was standing near another Sonata that was idling and one could not even hear it. My car is LOUD chattering, tinny sound, and when accelerating there is a groaning sound. It sounds like a a  very old car.  I drive very conservatively and at the speed limit, mostly in town, and the gas mileage I have gotten is not as advertised; the current ""fuel economy"" listed on the dash is 17.9. I got the car for its great gas mileage. Has anyone else had similar issues? I would like the dealer to replace the entire car. I don't want them to ""repair"" or replace the engine because it is a brand new car and should not have such issues, and if they start ""repairing"" it so early, it will certainly not be a new car."
"above Accord or Camry  I've had my Sonata Limited for 3 months.  I wanted an old man's car and therefore was not too concerned with high performance or flashy appearance.  I would have been happy with any of the loaded midsize sedans: Accord, Camry, Altima, Passat, Fusion, Malibu or Sonata. Considering only the top three in reliability, I eliminated all but the Accord, Camry and Sonata.  I believe that cars are going through a drastic change over the next 3 to 5 years.  So, I wanted my next car to be loaded with as much of the new tech stuff as possible. All three top out at somewhere between $32,500 and $35,000.  Honda and Toyota would only knock off at most $3,000 to $4,500 the MSRP.  I bought my Hyundai $10,000 less than MSRP ($33,555).  If I sell it in 4 to 7 years, I believe that Hyundai will have as good a reputation for reliability as Honda or Toyota.  I'm 6'3"" and 225 lbs with knees that don't bend very much.  The Sonata is the easiest to get in and out of and has the most room. With my iPhone 7, the entertainment center does everything I could ask of it and with great speakers. I couldn't notice any significant difference among the three in handling, noise, ride and comfort.  Performance will have to go to the other's with a V6. Hyundais only come with a I4. (I get my performance fix racing go-karts.) I check my gas mileage every time I fill up.  Never have I gotten less than 25.3 mpg (all city driving).  On the highway, I get 37mpg but that is driving 70-80 mph."
"Great car  I have always owned/leased high end cars.  Traded my loaded 2015 Genesis 3.8 for the Sonata Limited 2.0T.  In general, I am very pleased with the car.  However, if you're downsizing from a Lexus or Genesis like I did, you might be a little dissappointed with the ride which is a little rough and with some road noise.  The Sonata compares well to its competitors in all aspects including price.  So, given the price differential between high end cars and the Sonata, one could live with the minor shorcomings.  Overall handling is great.  Electronics are as good if not better than most any high end cars.  Safety features are great.  The power seats are widely adjustable and very comfortable.  Overall, I am very happy with the car.    Yes, I miss my Genesis but I'm getting used to a smaller car payment lower insurance premiums and much better gas mileage.  In addition to all that, the car looks great."
"feels like a prius with turbo lag  adding to title, do not know if suspension is different than sport but sport was more planted. sport has better wheels and tires and 300 more lbs which perhaps adds to more refined ride. acceleration not much different in time but eco shifts can be rough at lower speeds."
AWESOME DRIVER AIDS  Traded my 2013 Sonata SE in on this 2017 Sonata Limited 2.0T in order to take advantage of all the updated driver safety aids.  The backup camera and blind spot detection are most appreciated.  The adaptive cruise control takes some getting confidence in but is very useful on our crowded freeways. The panoramic sunroof is also a nice feature. The two person driver seat memory  is great and the seats are very comfortable.  This car came outfitted with Michelin MXM tires which provide a quite ride with precise steering.
I love it!  I have always been a huge Mustang junkie. I vowed to one day own one when my daughters were big enough to actually enjoy the ride. And finally the day came. I got one. And I couldn't say enough great things about it. I love this car. I love the body style. The factory stereo is awesome. I have done a few minor adjustments to the appearance (cosmetic things like adding decals and window scoops) and also modified the exhaust. And even though its a v6 it looks and sounds like a v8. I get compliments all the time on how incredible the car looks. It is absolutely beautiful!
"Great Midsize Sedan Comfy Ride for Empty Nester  I have previously owned: 1979 Delta 88 Oldsmobile, 1988 Cutlass Sierra, 1999 Honda CRV 2WD, 2009 Mazda Madza 3 (rehabbed and still drive) 2012 Ford Fusion SE (traded in for this car). I like a sporty feel car but without the necessary high octane gas and manual shift equipment. As I am approaching 50 and my son is well out of the home, I have slowly navigated towards the mid-size sedans. My main reasons are more accessories to compensate for my short-comings as I get older and more comfort. (I spent nearly 2k on shocks, struts, alignment, breaks, tires and wheels for the Mazda - My 67 year old mom drives it now.) I traded in my 2012 Ford Fusion with 127k miles with an excellent interstate ride and suspension system. Fast forward to today. So Hyundai had a really nice rebate...up to 6k on the Sonata thru 5/31/2017 and I was upside down on my Fusion...by a lot. Needed a comparable larger sedan to help me compensate. I work for Enterprise so I can really ride a plethora of vehicles to try out car types. (well really anyone can...and it's worth it...especially if you're looking for a major upgrade in some way). I rented the Hyundai Santa Fe and although it was nice...this standard SUV was really too much for my needs at this point in life. I thought I wanted the Hyundai Tucson crossover instead. But it would have been a less comfortable payment. In walks the Hyundai Sonata that I've sold time and time again as a rental and thought...meh...Hyundai (remember it's mediocre start). Man! Have they come along way baby. I am the owner of a new Hyundai 2017 Sonata Sport with the Value Package. Talk about taste of luxury and bells and whistles. It may not have the market mind-share of Lexus, Mercedes, BMW or the like. But it definitely has some luxury touches. Rear view camera helps me back up. Boy oh boy does it help especially since this empty nester must wear glasses for my astymatism and for close reading. The navi screen is awesome. Great that I can plug and play my phone into the Android phone option. All the necessary buttons for making phone calls, volume and other necessities it all compiled in a simplistic area. I feel confident as a woman driving along and even out of town. Push to start is amazing and I'm getting more and more use to it...and how about that auto trunk open feature. Sound system is great. Ride is comfortable on the interstate and even though it's a long car...it does not feel bulky in traffic congestion. Seats are great for my full-figure frame...part leather and cloth. Oh did I mention the sun-roof. Large enough to let some sun and air in without messin' up my 'do. For the first time I opted for Silver which is a kind of plain color but the black and chrome silver accents make it look more luxurious. At this point I am completely satisfied and completely convinced I got the better deal for midsize cars on the market right now. Assistance manuals are comprehensive and I will have to probably take about 3 months to learn all my car can do. I'm so looking for it. Me and my mom and best friend are going to have some sweet travels in the vehicle, Lord willing."
"Second Hyundai and Last  I love driving and allow drivers the right to drive the speed limit., I'm almost 60, have owned many none luxury vehicles.  I buy cars to drive and hope I have nothing but minor non performance issues. Nothing is absolutely perfect today or ever. But I would like a few basis, decent acceleration, comfortable highway ride, good braking, and reliable front alignment. My 2016 Tuscon ECO with 1.6L and 7 Speed transmission was absolutely great, except for 1st gear. The dual clutch transmission which did have a recall due to safety issues seldom responded the same way twice in a row, you never knew how it would respond. Some times like a bat out of hell, others like a deer caught in head lights. I didn't trust lending it to anyone a cared about, I owned it for 17 months, I learned how to drive it, I have owned a few vehicles with standard transmissions, it's like driving a standard and no control of the clutch. I traded it in for a 2017 Sonata Sport 2.4L drove it 10 miles and discovered a issues talked about on-line for years. When vehicle is in gear stopped at red light, there is a vibration felt in drivers seat. Open the hood of the engine, place your hand on the plastic cowling covering the engine and you will immediately know where it's coming from. It's not just your car, try telling your dealers sales manager that. It's seem like denial rules over respect for owner's experience and opinions are the acceptable norm for doing business today. Most of us buy cars to enjoy, not to be a critic, since most of us are not paid to criticize or endorse. We just want to think we made a good decision and can share it with friends and family who care. It's a 2017 Sonata Sport not a 2015."
"Great value  For the price I paid, this car is a great value.  It has loads of interior space and great safety features.  The interior design is ok, nothing spectacular but again for the price more than adequate.  The exterior design is very nice, especially with the sport package.  I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a great value.  The longer I own the car the more satisfied I am with the purchase."
"Sometimes I just want to go on a joy ride!  I was coming off a 2015 Sentra and I never really liked it all that much. I mean it was a great car and had good gas mileage but never loved it. I was just driving by a dealership and decided to stop in to take a look at a Sonata because someone in my neighborhood has a 2015/2016 one and it always caught my eye. As soon as I got on the lot I saw a Blue Sonata Sport, took it on a test drive, instantly sold. First, pricing makes this a very affordable car giving you the most bang for your buck in this class. The model I got has the package with the sunroof, leather seats, etc etc etc. Second, I am 6'4"" 280lb former football player so its hard finding something I feel comfortable in... I fit perfect in this. Easy to get in and out, plenty of leg room, my head isnt right up against the roof, even with the seat back (not even all the way) rear passengers still have leg room. Infotainment system is pretty good. No complaints here. Compatible with Android Auto and Apple Car Play, which my neighbors brand new $50k Acura MDX doesnt have and they are a bit jealous of that ha! Now to driving, in regular driving mode its a little sluggish off the line but I have zero problems getting up up to speed quickly or passing someone. Now if you want to have some fun, throw it into Sport and pop it over to sportmatic shifting and go down some winding back roads. Now its nothing like the Lancer EVO I had in my younger years, but steering and suspension is nice and tight and very responsive. Allows you to accelerate out of tight curves without any body roll and nice solid grab on the road. Bottom line, this is a great car all around. You wont see it featured in the Fast & Furious franchise but it is fun to drive and you shouldn't have any buyers remorse either."
"Sonata Limited 2.0 PZEV  I owned an Audi A4.  I tested a BMW, like the way it rode but did not like the interior (for a female) controls too complicated.  I tested the good old Camry XL, the materials and quality of everything that was Camry has deteriorated.  Its not the same Camry I knew and owned in the past with very cheap materials. It felt like the old Toyota Tercels inside.   I test drove an Accord for two hours.  It does not handle bumps very well. If you have any issues with your spine, neck, hips this car was like driving a washing machine. The next day I had pain in my pelvis, which I never had before and spent a full day in bed on a heating pad.I test drove the Fusion, that car shook so violently, its just the way its made.   Then I drove the Sonata Limited 2.0.  It rides perfect, handles bumps like cushions. The inside is very nice, quiet. The layout of the instrumentation is so easy and logical I didnt even need to look at the book.  It brakes great, I have cross traffic alert and all the bells and whistles on it.  It was $30,000 and I leased it for 3 years for 14,000 including tax and tags.  We drove this car out of state on a long trip and it drove and handled like a dream.  There is not one thing I can say about this car thats negative. I wish I had test driven the Sonata 2.0 Limited before I tried the other cars.  If you want a car that rides like a dream, gives you plenty of rear seat room, air conditioned front vented seats, good braking, great visibility, better headlights than the Audi's expensive lights, this is the car for you.  Seriously. I spent almost a year looking for cars.   I had parked this car in a parking lot and when I came out, I went over to the Audi A6 that was the same size and looked exactly the same (except for the front grille) and thought it was my Sonata.  Yes, its that good and half the price of the A6.  I had test drove the A6 as well and I didnt like the heaviness of the car plus the complicated information system and the ""Ipad"" that sticks up from the dashboard blocking your view of the street.   Everything about the Sonata was perfect.  Im seriously considering leasing again when the 3 years are up.   I recommend this car and test drive it against the Camry and  youll see what Im talking about.  The Limited Sonata has 17 inch wheels, the base has 16.   I have the 17 inch wheels which are better than 16.   The Audis have low profile tires, which means far less cushion on the road and a harder stiff ride.  I have never driven a car so comfortable as the Sonata, so if your thinking of this car, especially if your a female or older, I highly recommend it.   I get approx. 35 mpg mixed highway and local.  I cant put in the amount in the chart below for some reason."
"Enjoying my second Sonata with reservations  The 2017 Sonata Sport 2.0T replaces my 2014 Sonata Limited 2.0T.  The car is mostly unchanged with a few exceptions.  The 2017 Sport 2.0T lacks some of the Limited 2.0T features including the automatic rear view mirror, blind spot warning, push button start, moon roof, and ventilated AC seats.  I really don't miss most of these options but it is frustrating that the 2017 Sport 2.0T lacking the features of the 2014 Limited 2.0T is actually priced about the same as the 2014! I have also noticed that the 2017 is noisy and the turbo lags more than my 2014. On the other hand, the 2017 Sport Turbo 2.0 handles better and the steering is more resistant that the 2014, probably because the 2017 is sport tuned and the 2017 supports Apple CarPlay which is a big plus for me! (No need for buying the expensive navigation system.)  One thing that may be a issue for some drivers is that the steering resistance cannot be altered as it could be in the 2014.  Despite the concerns that I have stated I am overall satisfied with my Hyundai Sonata Sport 2.0T but the Sonata is no longer the great value that it has been in the past."
"Best true value for your hard earned buck  After owning the car now for 1 year, the Sonata continues to be a very good handling car, the car is still very quiet while on the road, The car still has a very comfortable ride both in the city and on the highway, Hwy mileage I recorded 37 mpg, I see the tires that came from the factory will not last more than 25,000 miles I have 13,200 miles on the car and they are starting to show wear even though I have rotated them every 6,000 miles. The 3 recalls are a concern but at least Hyundai recalled the issues. The cars safety cage is TOP NOTCH, a Sienna backed into my side fender and I was not scratched, the car is very well made"
"Pretty, but needs refinement  Nice interior/exterior, but at the cost of acceleration, road noise.  Very stiff steering.  Coming from a smooth-as-butter Lexus, there is no comparision."
"Most Good, with some quirks  Pros: smooth drive train, great seats, overall pleasantness    Quirks: engine isolation not the best - small engine vibration noticeable, stereo drops iphone bluetooth connection fairly often, wanders down the road a bit at 75+ (vs. prior Volkswagen Passat), regular stereo a little tinny - no speakers in front doors, only on dash, trunk has to be slammed, lots of little chirping noises and songs, using navigation with apple carplay means not listening to the radio (the limited does not come with built-in nav unless additional option package selected), stereo to me seems a little complicated (again, compared to VW Passat). Overall great car and happy with it, just a little quirky."
"Fly, drive and relax in traffic...a smooth ride  Test drive and feel the difference between the base Sonata and the Sports 2.4L. There's a difference in acceleration. Also, quieter ride. Get the optional upgrade for sports suspension and then you also get the sunroof, tire locks, etc, as part of a reasonable package. It's a joy to travel in, especially when stuck in rush-hour traffic. Fuel economy was a major consideration - averaging 20,000 miles / yr, with less than half being highway miles."
My BlueStang  I have had this vehicle for a little over a month and I must say that it is a keeper. SO fun to drive and the gas mileage isn't bad either. I am so heavy on the pedal that I can make a econocar get bad gas mileage. The Mustang likes to be pushed. And the 5 speed is fun!
Great  Edmunds helped us feel confident with our purchase and gave us some help when dealing with the dealership.
"Sonata owner since 2007!!!!  My second sonata since 2007!  Let me say  this 2017 has So much interior room and a nice ride on the road! Huge trunk! The only downfall for me is the fabric on seats..I feel it should have been better quality for a 21,000 dollar car. My other sonata was a 3.3 liter and I loved the extra horsepower. Maybe for 2018 model Hyundai should add V6 as a option which will make me buy another great Sonata!!!!! also change the fabric on the seats to have them higher quality and plush."
"Bought the hard to find 2017 Sonata Eco  I research cars for a couple of years before buying, and this time around I had a list of 12 sedans and SUV's that I slowly eliminated through test drives until ending up with the Sonata Eco.  I have 1000 miles on the car and am extremely pleased with it.  Before buying, I drove a base model Sonata for a week as a rental and liked the feel of the car.  It rides well, has a lot of features, and the build quality is excellent, but it's a bit slow to accelerate, around average for large sedans.  I've followed dual-clutch transmissions for a few years, so the Eco intrigued me.  It comes with 1.6L engine with a dual scroll turbo that runs great on regular gas, and a dual-clutch transmission.  For those who are unfamiliar, it's a computer-controlled transmission that works something like a manual, but the computer can shift considerable faster than a human.  It's also faster than a standard automatic transmission, though not as smooth.  The engine produces 179 HP, less than the base model, but 195 ft-lbs of torque with a wide max torque band starting at 1500 RPM.  The lighter engine and transmission drops the curb weight from 3587 for the base to 3219 for the Eco.  The combination of a faster tranny, max torque at 1500 RPM, and less weight means that the Eco cuts about .7 seconds off the 0-to-60 time, and in high-speed driving, it accelerates beautifully.  It passes slowbies in the fast lane like they're not there.  It's hard to believe that you can get performance this good out of an engine whose combustion chambers are smaller than a half-gallon of milk.  The Eco also gets outstanding mileage - rated at 28 city/ 39 hwy vs 25/36 for the base - if you can resist putting it in sport mode and driving with a heavy foot.   Best of all, since the car hasn't caught on yet, you can get good deals on it.  I got mine for $4015 off the MSRP.  The speakers and the radio are great - it comes with a Sirius XM radio that sounds wonderful.  My last two cars were a 2006 VW Passat 2.0T and a 2014 Mazda 6, both really good cars, but I like the Sonata Eco even better.Update 6/5/17 - I now have 11, 500 miles on the car.  I still think it's great and that I got an excellent value.  It's solid in daily driving around town, but really excels out on the highway. My wife and I have gone on a couple of 1800-mile round trips, switching off driving.  The ride is very smooth, the 40-to-80 acceleration phenomenal, and the highway gas mileage incredible given the size and feel of the car.  We're getting 38+ mpg in Eco mode even though we're running around 80 on the interstates and passing the slowbies.  But it's the overall experience of the car we enjoy.  The car is comfortable, we put on music or a book-on-CD and the miles just melt away.  The dual-clutch transmission works great in normal driving, but every once in awhile acts up in very slowing driving, like backing into a parking space.  If you put it in reverse and back straight in, it works just fine.  But if you have to switch between drive and reverse to adjust your position, it seems like the DCT ""gets confused"", and either takes a few seconds to go into gear, or goes into second instead of first.  This is a very minor irritation in comparison to how smoothly the car operates under normal conditions, and it does seems to be a characteristic of DCT's.  I'll trade off a little low-speed bumpiness for the beautiful high-speed performance any day.Update 12/5/17 - Have 22,000 miles on the car now and still think it's great.  Am still getting 32 mpg combined on daily outings and 38 on long interstate trips driving between 75 and 85.  On long straight flat stretches, I can put the cruise control on 75 and it gets 40-42.  It's amazing to get that kind of gas mileage without giving up comfort, space and acceleration.Update 6/5/18 - Approaching 30,000 and still very happy with the car.  I had a fender bender.  The other car had about $3000 in damage but the Sonata was barely scratched.  Fixed the dings myself and the car still looks good.  The paint has held up well despite parking it outdoors.  The gas mileage continues to be excellent.  There are three drive modes, normal, eco and sport.  For my everyday driving, a combination of street and suburban highway, the normal setting gives me decent power and 32 MPG.  On long trips on the interstate, the ECO setting plus cruise control gets me 40.  I hardly use the sport setting at all, since it doesn't provide that much better acceleration and the mileage drops into the mid-20's in combined driving. The acceleration in normal mode is more than enough to handle freeway on-ramps and maintain good fast-lane speed.  I drove a 2018 Chevy Malibu rental with 14,000 miles for a week, and while it sells for a couple thousand more than my Hyundai did, it is not as good.  It's not bad, but the car was already developing some squeaks, gurgles and glitches that the Sonata hasn't, and it is not as comfortable in either seating or driving."
Great drive for a great price!!!!!!  Know that if you are on budget and want the best bang for your buck. This car is worth taking a good look at. Great ride and preforms very well and a phenomenal warranty!
"Great ride!  I just bought a 2017 Hyundai Sonata, and I love it! It has the back up camera, and the entertainment features I love. Very happy and satisfied with my purchase."
"Best car I've ever owned  Stellar performance. Car features are very nice, such as Android Auto. All my friends think I must have paid close to 30K for this model. In fact I paid a little over 17K. I'm driving Sonata for a month now, so far it's the best car I've ever owned."
"Watch out for???  Bought a 2017 Sonata 4 DR. Was not told by Dealer/Sales or Management that the Navigation system in my Sonata was only workable when MY CELL phone was pluged into the automobile's port. When I went to another dealer, then I was told ""the Sonata Limited"" had Navigation that did NOT require what I was told at the first dealership. PROBLEM was I already purchased the first one. I was so upset that in ONE weeks time I turned THAT Sonata in for the one I did not know about earlier..  Shame on Dealership"
"Bang for the Buck  The Hyundai Sonata is a very good car with lots of interior room, large trunk, comfortable seats, great legroom in the front seats, easy to understand and operate controls.  Base model comes with most options one would want on a car.  Gas mileage averages 30 mph.  Best of all, it can be bought new for less than 20K.  After two years of ownership,  still feel the same.  A great value!"
Satisfaction  
"Ok car, thats about it.  I rented a 2017 GLS model with the 2.4 liter 4 cylinder engine. We took it to Columbus Ohio from TN, so I had some time to get aquainted with it. The car only had 3 miles on it when we started off. It got pretty darn good gas mileage. I averaged 35.1 Mpg for the whole trip, that included city, highway, and idling for a while. However it seems the gas mileage came at the cost of power. Which happens, but the lack of power from the engine was very agravating while trying to merge in city traffic. The lack of ANY grunt at city speeds got old quick. Highway was ok. The seats are ok for short trips, but seemed uncomfortable to me for long trips. I mean, you have to get out and stretch on long trips, thats a given. But the seats were just plain uncomfortable after about 45min-1 hour of driving. The instruments and dash were pretty nice and oriented well. AC was great. Radio/bluetooth were great. Lights and steering were good. Glad it has a blindspot mirror installed. The windshield was a little short for me and im 6'2. I had the seat adjusted as low as possible, still had to lean it back a bit. It would be a great highway car if it were just more comfortable. For stop and go and city merging, it needs more grunt. Overall id say it would be a good choice for getting you to work and dropping the kid off at school. But not for trips unless you pack icy-hot and ibuprophen."
"My 1st Mustang ever  I got the 40th edition model '04 Mustang & so far I'm very happy with my purchase.  Plus I got a great deal on it.  Prior to my Mustang, I've always been extremely satisfied with every Kapanese automobile I've owned (3) and seemed to lean towards Japanese automakers, but this time I wanted to make a leap of faith back to the domestics.  I really like the recent Mustang body styles, especially the new 2005.  The ride is very smooth and the cabin is quiet cruising both city & highway.  It's fun to drive and it has excellent acceleration for a V6, but then the fuel mileage I'm getting is lower than I originally expected.  I get about 240 city & 300 highway to the tank.  "
I'm in love  This car has great looks and has more than enough  power for the price.
"Great one owner, bought new..garaged,non smoking  Love this car. Just think I should keep my cars current...trading in on another Sonata, hopefully."
50 mph accident  I was in a real bad car accident going 50 mph and not one of the 12 airbags went off.
Sonata  Great car
"Nice used car with great price  Car is loaded and very comfortable. Has excellent legroom in both front and back seats, which is one of my concerns due to arthritis."
"2014 Hyundai Sonata  Bought the car in good condition at 30,000 miles and had a solid mechanic look it over (just in case) with nothing obvious. Lacks the torque compared to other vehicles (knew this when buying). So far have experienced two main failures after having put an additional 30,000 miles the transmission failed as I was driving on the Interstate (fun). The local dealer did honor the warranty and replaced it, while paying for a rental, after about 4 weeks I had it back. At about 80,000 miles the car started to experience issues where it would not start after refueling it, had it towed to a mechanic as the dealer said they could only look at it while charging me. Had the starter replaced as the battery was new and tested fine, it did restart. Refueled again, wouldn't start, have to disconnect the battery to get the car to start now. I am still looking for a mechanic to resolve but am overall disappointed with the vehicle. Other issues, the engine makes a loud grinding sound when brought up to speed (have to be gentle when accelerating), engine vibrates the entire car (been going on since about 50,000 miles), the center console plastic latch broke, and the glasses holder snapped out of place (broken). The car does get decent gas mileage (36 highway/30 city). It had decent safety ratings when I bought it, I am at 3 or 4 recalls so far. Out of all the vehicles having been exposed to growing up, I will be sadly avoiding Hyundai after this car."
New to Hyundai coming from a Lexus IS350  Can't think of anything
"Wonderful car, highly recommend!  It's a great car, I get on one tank of gas from OH to NY!"
running under the coldair in the summer time  I am having problems with my 2014 sonata running under the air during summer hot months. Once a month I have to put refrige in to stay cold. Is it any recall for air condition problems. it have been checked for leaks and cost $364.00 It's only 3 years old surely I don't have to put on a line for air condition this early during ownership.
"She's a keeper!  Beware! This car has a touchy accelerator pedal! Very peppy car! It has a smooth comfortable ride though and feels stable and solid. Very roomy inside. Headlights need some improvement on low beam, maybe a brighter bulb would help."
"My GT  If you're looking for a cheap, 
reliable, fun-to-drive performance car 
that's not too hard on gas, then this 
is your car. This car looks good from 
the inside and out and the exhaust 
note I hear everytime I start it is 
like therapy. Everything is set up 
perfectly for the young enthusiast.

"70+ widow reviews Hyundai 2014 Sonata  It's comfy, rides well at all speeds; great performance -- just like its owner."
GRETA  ITS JUST GREAT
"Super car at any price  Outstanding performer in all aspects except for one. The suspension is very stiff...they call it a ""sport"" suspension. What it really means is that if you have to drive the rough California freeways as I do be prepared to have your innards shaken a bit. Beyond that, a great vehicle."
Great car  Better gas mileage than anticipated!!Gets 40 MPG Hwy.  Overall MPG Mixed Driving 32
"Our first Hyundai  Nice car and ride is smooth. This is an economical car with a roomy interior and plenty of trunk space. The dashboard controls are conveniently placed for both driver and passenger. It was purchased recently and hoping it will go well over 120,000 miles."
"good value 4 $  Does not have front LED Headlights as standard. Must request and pay! overall great deal 4 regular,logical, people who require reliability in their cars."
"My last Hyundai...Period!  I purchased a Sonata Hybrid Limited in April of 2013.  About a year later, it seemed that an occasional panic stop would cause the car to stop abruptly rather than pulse to a safe stop.   After noticing that it seemed to do that each of the few times that I applied the brakes in that manner, I took the car to the dealer, asking them to also check the brakes for a banging noise occurring each time the brakes were applied when coming to a stop sign/light.
 Many months and service calls later, my VA Lemon Law attorney suggested that I might want to avoid Hyundai or Kia if I ever expected to have my interests considered.  I traded in that piece of @)$(*^* as quickly as I could!"
"Sure is nice.  I picked up a 2014 GLS after several rides in a friend's 2013. All the current tech gizmos are there including butt warmers and a hi-res backup camera. The ride is comfortable and secure, handling is very good. Visibility is only average as the seating seems a bit low; got to concentrate to avoid scraping the wheels around curbs. ""Eco"" setting short-shifts the transmission, ok in town but annoying in hilly terrain; regular mode delivers 26 mpg anyway in a 50/50 mix.***10/2016 update. Still regarded as a wise purchase. No issues. Highway economy at a steady 70 with cruise control was 38 mpg. The engine could have used more torque but will happily rev to find needed performance. Manual mode transmission is great for descents. The onboard average fuel economy readout is about 2.5 mpg overoptimistic. The satellite-enabled radio is slick, and the Bluetooth hands-free cell phone system is a joy to use!***4/2017 update. No major issues or failures. The female half of the seat belt is so short that finding it on dark mornings is more luck than skill. Still wish the engine had more torque; switching over to manual mode and holding a lower gear to keep the revs up is a work-around.***10/2017 update. Still no failures."
"Uncompromised comfort and refinement  I rented a base model with only 300 miles on it.I'm a tough reviewer, but this car really impressed me.I loved the dash - Hyundai made the controls very simple and intuitive - so you'll never get angry at the car because you can't figure out how to work the climate control, cruise control, etc.At highway speed there is zero wind noise (amazing).The quietness, ride smoothness, comfy seats, cold and powerful AC and the quality look and feel to everything are reminiscent of the 1990's Camry's we all loved.Toyota doesn't make a Camry with uncompromised comfort and refinement anymore so it's neat to know the Hyundai does and it's called the Sonata "
"14 Ltd 2.0T with Tech Pkg  Other than the very annoying legal disclaimer that comes on every time you start the car, no matter what mode, the Nav is improved over 2013. Sound deadening is improved, but the tires are still too hard and noisy with the 2.0T (most people ditch them as soon as possible). Kind of odd that the Kia Optima has more features similarly equipped..."
"The Best Mustang Yet  I have owned many Mustangs. From a 1965 Coupe to a 2003 Mach 1 (I still own that one). This is the best Mustang yet in every area. It handles well, looks great, and has much more room that any previous Mustang. I have a five speed manual and it gets over 30 mpg on the highway although it is not rated that high. This car is the best ""all around"" car I have ever owned. In addition everywhere I go everyone compliments me on the car and wants to know all about it.  I have found that not only is this car welcome at Mustang shows it is also welcome at all local cruise in's, car shows, etc. Try that with your SUV.  It is 1965 all over again with this latest generation Mustang! "
"Fun to drive  Always wanted a mustang finally bought 
one, and love this car. Fun to drive 
and handles well. Paint job is 
beautiful and and the extras are great. "
"Red Turbo  I purchased a 2014 turbo SE. I wanted a v6 but did not want to spend the gas for the power, so the turbo fits the bill. With 274 horsepower it has plenty of power for merging onto the freeway, passing, and gets a respectable 0-60 time. I am averaging 23 mpg city, and 33 hwy. The car is smoother and quieter than the 2013 gls we have. The backup camera is nice, it take some getting used to if you never had one. I have already used it to help in parallel parking. I like the handling, steering, power, comfort, and style that the Sonata turbo SE has. I highly recommend the Sonata turbo to anyone wanting the power of a v6 but the gas mileage of a 4 banger."
"Bad roof creaking  with only 46,xxx miles on it. the roof make a horrible creaking noise when going over speed bumps and even worse on gravel roads. should of gotten a Civic EX-L. engine is running fine and everything else is well... it just doesn't feel like it did less then 9 short months ago."
"less than satisfied   gas mileage not what was advertised transmission shifts into higher gears at the wrong time. took it back to dealer and was told it is running as designed. that is there standard answer instead of trying to fix it. complained to Hyundai and that was a waste of time. beware of the advertised fuel mileage, although I am sure it is an industry wide problem of not getting what is advertised as far as gas mileage"
"MY new 2014 Sonata  We are very happy with our new car.Shortly after we purchased it we drove it on a long trip.We got 34 MPG on the highway at Texas interstate speeds, 75 MPH+, and close to 30 MPG in city driving.We are still getting used to all of the functions it has to offer."
"New 2014 SE 2.0T 1k miles in  I have had the car now for just under 1k miles.I do not see much difference with the steering wheel comfort/sport settings.At 6'2"" it has plenty of room for me even with the sunroof.Back up camera is good, power is nice, averaging 26 MPG total.Was able to use Boostup website to get additional $500 off for a total cost for the 2014 Premium package SE 2.0T at $26885 before tax, fees, etc.Felt like amazing deal to me."
"Best car I've owned  I bought this car new in Las Vegas in 2004. It was car of the Year. It is now 2017 and I have 74000 miles on it. I have never tuned it up and it runs like a top. I had the timing belt and water pump replaced about 3-4 years ago, not because I had problems but that the manual says replace at 60000 miles. Reason water pump was replaced is because once you change timing belt you replace water pump to save on labor. When I got my timing belt that they replaced , it looked perfect. Only thing that cost me money was replacing light bulbs, and battery wipers and regular fluid changes. Even tho I've had my car for 13 years in 100 degree plus summers, the paint looks almost like the day I bought it. I drive to southern California on the 15 freeway and the car handles like a top even doing 105 MPH most of the way. Solid drive on its 2.7 liter V-6. I plan on keeping this car forever after seeing some of the other reviews showing owners that have well over 100000 on their cars. GREAT CAR!"
one of the nicest cars I've ever had  Have it checked bye mechanic
"Best car I ever bought, other than my Honda  Like buying a poor mans Honda."
"My 2004 sonataa  I bought my 2004 sonata used for only 4500! It now has 212,000 miles on it and runs awesome and has never left me stranded. The only thing ive had to do to it is a tune up, oil changes, changing of head lights and tail lights. I had to buy new tires after 2 years and a starter for it but thats it. It may sound like a lot but it was just regular maintenance that it needed. Never had any other problem with it. It just started making a creaking noise and i think its my cv axles that need replaced but i wouldnt trade this car for a new one because the space in the car is amazing i think and the new cars have to much technology in them and are compact cars that look big and bulky. Ill keep my 2004 hyundai sonata till it wont drive anymore! Hope this helps."
"The best car if you take Care of it  My hyundai belonged to my dad before he gave it to me. He bought it new and it has never had any major issues. Just did regular maintenance. The only thing I don't like is the headlights don't seem
To be very bright! But other than that I love the car and it's always been really reliable. Just watch out for the timing belt, because of the interference engine. Don't replace it late. Other than that the car is amazing and has never failed me. Already has 190000 miles on it and runs beautifully. "
"More Bang For Your Buck!  VA 41 yo 6'3 240lb MWM. I bought my new
torch red, 5spd Mustang in April for 13K
(newsp ad).  It looks great, is
comfortable and handles well for the
money.  Wind out the trany and get to 60
in about 7 secs.  The tough attitude of
it's appearance/color seems to yield me
the right of way with other drivers, who
don't cut me off and let me merge in
traffic.  Gas mileage was Ok but got
much better once I put the tires at 40
PSI, although a slightly rougher feeling
ride.  The only problems have been that
the drivers seat belt was twisted at the
anchor, the repeat button only works for
MP3's, and the headrest doesn't adjust
to my height. The dealer fixed the 1st
problem, the others are standard."
My Sonata  For sure the head lights have a problem with having to be replaced.I also had to have the steering assembly replaced at over $1000.Now after 14 months it is starting to leak again and makes a buzzing noise due to that.I've never owned a car where I had to replace such a component.Not happy about this at all.
"Best Car I've Ever Owned  I bought my Sonata with 17,000 miles on it.It now has 204,000 miles and it's still going strong.It has never once left me stranded, and I've only had to do the usual car maintenance: brakes, tires, tune up, etc.I have been meticulous about oil changes every 3,000 miles.The interior is still in great shape, and it continues to be a comfortable ride, still.Truly the best car I've ever owned. My only complaint is that it's not the greatest in terms of gas mileage."
"I've never had a more reliable car  I've had this car for about 6 years now. It has never let me down. Not long after buying it, I rear-ended an old truck that should have, in all honesty, torn things up. The car started right back up and has been running flawlessly ever since. I've never had a bad belt and, unlike my Ford, a broken a/c compressor doesn't affect engine performance. The serpentine belt started squealing a little shortly before the alternator went dead earlier this year, but I suspect a squeaky pulley rather than the belt. There is plenty of power and handles very well. I trust it to keep me and my family safe on the road, within reason."
"Reliable, but has little else going for it.  Despite check engine lights, awful squealing from the serpentine belt, and a transmission fluid leak that prompted an emergency repair (shifts smoothly years later), this car has NEVER failed me.That said, there are issues. Constant rattling from interior trim pieces. Serpentine belt squeals despite several repairs. A headlight that is prone to failure. The 2.4 I4 has that wonderful combination of disappointing gas mileage and a deficit in power, and it shakes quite a bit. Handling is somewhere between Buick and BMW. But all in all, if you just need reliable transportation and don't mind getting the heck annoyed out of you, by all means get it. Certainly cheaper than alternatives."
"yay i bought a car...  Got my Sonota because of consumer reviews saying how much they all loved there car. Not the case with me. Took it off the lot and cerpintene belt immediatley started squiling, something not right with ignition(car hesitates),speakers started ratelling and check engine light came on. Repaired the cerpentine belt twice only for the d*mn thing to start squeling again. Decided to deal with it till driving to work one morning and com sensor went (took hyundai 3 days to figure out). 29 day mark of ownership, had the car taken to the dealership.oh ya, was very comfortable to drive, an only 60,000 miles."
"A very well built car  Bought my 2004 Sonata 4cyl base model used in 2006 with 24K miles.My car currently has 138K miles and still going.No major work needed.Biggest repair was the cv/boot from all the speed bumps I went over.This cost about $600. Also needed a new engine mount at about 100K miles.I get 25MPG city and 31MPG on long trips. The other drawback is the paint job.Very peeled, but not worth repairing for a 7 year old car.They make good cars."
Reliable Driver  Got this vehicle from my mother 4 years ago.Has been very reliable with no major repairs required to this point.Comfort of seats is fair and interior design on base model is bland but it gets the job done.
"Trouble  Fuel pump has failed 3xs sense ownership at 50k. The water pump went out at 100,000 which destroyed the pistons, brand new timing belt and the heads. Now I have a brand new Hyundai (joy). The car looks brand new after having the hubcap and door handles painted. Ride and comfort is fine but overall not impressed"
"I love this car - it's a keeper!  I can't say enough about my Sonata. It's dependable, reliable and simply a great looking car.  I saw someone driving this car in 2004, walked into my credit union back inquired on this vehicle and said exactly what I wanted and I got it 2 days later.  Never test drive this car, first time ever doing that when purchasing a car! Best thing I ever did and have not regrets either. I plan on buying another Hyundai but I do plan to keep my Sonata.  It too had a paint chip in the door handles and a radiator replacement but overall it's an outstanding car.  I have had this car 6 years now and approximately 190,000 miles.  Imagine that!  Longest I ever owned a car with that many miles."
"Best Sonata that Hyundai has ever made!  I have had this car for about a year and a half, and I love it.  The only downside is city mileage.  I love the style inside and out.  Inside, the mahogany wood grain complements the interior nicely.  Plus, the body style has an expensive look to it.  It is silver, which to me is the best color of all the 04 Sonata's.  It's sleek, sporty, and rather fast surprisingly.  I have the V6 2.7L, which delivers a lot of power and speed.  It may be six years old, but she still runs like a champ.  I Love this car, and I hope to get another 100,000 thousand miles out of her."
"Love that Car!! 2004 Mustang GT!!  This car is the best car I have ever 
had. When I just look at her, I get 
that warm, fuzzy feeling...I just love 
her. I feel like Sam from Cheers, as I 
am very protecteive of her...LOL
    She is just so beautiful, 
comfortable, stylish, and so much FUN!!"
"Love My Sonata  Love this car. Also own Lincoln Town Car. 72,900 on it now and have only replaced the headlights (3 times) but I drive with them on all the time. Bought it 2 yr old with 18,000 miles and it has not whimpered one time. Car cruises at 75-80 on a regular basis, the ac is always cold, suspension is tight and I have only replaced tires and a battery.  Use it as the community car when company comes and they love it. Even the BMW and Audi owner.  The car is heavy for its size and hugs the road. Did a 3500 mile road trip without fail, no issues. It gets about 26 mpg and growls when you really romp it."
"My first car!  This is my first car and i love it! But i have a few problems. The caps for the fogs lights come off real easily. I have a check engine light on for a cylinder 3 misfire. The emergency brake barely works, the headlights don't last long. The power steer is shot. The power antenna doesn't work. But it is an extremely reliable car. I plan to own it for a long time. I would recommend this car to anybody."
"My First Sonata  I have a 100 mile commute to work.  This is primarily driven on a Interstate.  Nothing has been replaced on the car except for the air conditioner condenser, because a rock punctured the original. As of today I have 119,000 on the car and still enjoy it like it was new.  My next car is going to be the Sonata Hybrid. Thanks for making a great car."
Walking Hyundai Commercial  I love this car!  I bought it new and have 190000 miles on it.  I have had water pump and timing at 100000 miles and those are standard items to go at that mileage.  I would recommend this car to anyone and hope to have another brand new Sonata soon!
Sonata rebiew  No problems for five years.  Low maintenance vehicle. 
"Driving experince good.  my only complaint abut my hyundai is the paint on the door handles all chipped off, I was given a tub of paint  for me to apply and it didn't work. I had to pay to have them really do over.  "
Great Car for the money  I have had this car for almost 4 years.  I have not had any problems with it.  I have 98k miles.  I have normal maintenance on it and purchased one set of tires only. As for warranties.  The power train warranty is great.  I just recently took it in for inspections and there is some work that will be covered by the warranty.
"Favorite Car  This car is super smooth at any speed. In my fifth year of driving it and would be glad to drive it another five.  If it were totaled tomorrow and I had to buy another car, I would look for another '04 (maybe an '05) Sonata.  Most problems were covered by the extended warranty.  I'm pushing 120k, so I'm on own now.  Driver's side air bag doesn't work.  Service tech at the Hyundai dealer said it's caused by all the trash pushed up under the seat, that's my fault.  I get a little over 20mpg. Could be better but I admit I have a heavy foot.  "
"Incredibly worry-free  I travel a lot of miles in the city and on the highway between Denver, Albuquerque, and Flagstaff. This vehicle has been completely flawless. I follow all manufacturer's recommended maintenance intervals: oil changes, drive belt, timing belt, spark plugs, etc. I will probably never sell this car as I am sure it will give me at least 250,000 good miles before any major repair is needed. Take good care of your Hyundai and it will take better care of you!"
"Good Car ,  Dealer Service Questionable  Car seems to be above average, but service dept. stinks. Engine warning light problems, ABS noise, and transmission concerns. Not sure if hyundai will be my next car. Jury still out."
"GO FOR THE 04!  With this 05 Mustang craze, you can
steal an 04 right now! This V6 is quite
spry with the 5-speed. Very good off the
line.       Drove the Automatic, only
felt slightly quicker then my 03 Chevy
Malibu.  This car handles excellent,
hopefully it wont be too terrible in the
winter.  Looks very sharp, interior is
basic, but it works in an old muscle car
sort of way.  Not bad every day
transportation, I put a five year old in
the back, he does not care, but backseat
not a good idea for larger people. 
Traded in a boring Hyundai Sonata for
this, don't miss it at all, BORING! 
This is a great mid-life crisis vehicle,
love driving to work every day."
This is my 1st Car Ever  This car is really great. it is a very stylish car and many people think that i am driving a Jaguar. This car is very well built. It can fit 5 people very comfortably. The trunk space is very large which is a good to always have. But my antenna broke. Due to the motor burn out. So now i can get the AM stations. I am curious about how it will drive in the snow because it has no traction control nor ABS.
"GREAT CAR, except breaks  My first brand new car purchase.  I have loved the car for 5.5 years, longest I have owned a car by 200%.  Only prob has been breaks...needed new rotors all around after 20k.  Needed more work another 15k into it.  Tires replaced at about 35k.  I don't drive the car aggressively.  Everything else was amazing.  Trading it in, got $5k for it.  Not bad, I paid $14,600 with sunroof 5.5 years ago.  "
"Great Vehicle  Purchased this car used with 70000 miles on it. This car looks and drives great with the V6.  Fuel economy is very good. AC is good. Reliabilty is superb. I put 1100 miles a week on it and have had no problems. In the passed 60K I have replaced two sets of tires, timing belt, spark plugs, headlight bulb,  oil and tranny fluids.  I am so impressed with this  Hyundai and still like it's ability..."
"Wonderful Car - Excellent Value  This has been a wonderful vehicle. I purchased it new and it has performed superbly. It still looks good and performs well. All of the maintenance has been performed by the dealership. Had to replace headlights and stereo has had a couple of minor glitches. The fuel economy has been a little substandard but now for the good stuff. Ride is comfortable and sporty; LX model has all of the bells and whistles including the sunroof; leather seats and power antenna are very nice. I would highly recommend Hyundai to anyone (wife has purchased a Santa Fe and daughter has bought an Elantra). I see why Time magazine has named Hyundai as the 2009 ""Car Manufacturer of the Year""."
"Terrific Car  This has been the most maintenance free car that I have ever owned - hands down. I have 110,000 miles on it and it still rides nice and smooth like the day I bought it. Outside of normal maintenance, the only thing that I have had to replace is a front headlight. The cost to operate this car is extremely minimal. I am passing it on the my daughter and I fully expect to get another 110,000 miles out of it."
"Extended Warrenty  This car has been a joke. We bought the car and are not high-mileage drivers. We also purchased the EXTENDED Warranty to ""Protect"" us in the future. As of today it has 51000 miles. Problems, Air went out, 3 batteries, broken engine mounts, fuel sensor (which it seems is not covered by our Extended Warranty). So much for ""protection."" Add to this our local dealer went belly up and we have to drive forever to get the car fixed and it is time for the Toyota."
"My 6 months of research paid off!  Best car I've ever owned, by far. I don't put many miles on it, so I expect to have this car for a long time. Gas mileage = 20-23 MPG -- wish it were better. Drives very nicely and quiet. The only problems have been the side mirror motors sticking (they ""release"" after I work the switch for a minute), and the power antenna not always going down all the way (one or two soft starts of the car usually fixes this). And, paint chips a bit too easily (from door dings).  Otherwise, fit & finish are great. The upgraded cloth seats are plush and comfy. Leather dash/steering has held up beautifully. And the car looks like a hybrid Mercedes C Class and a Jaguar. I've received many compliments! "
"Fantastic Sedan  This has been a great experience. My previous vehicle was a 1995 Monte Carlo V6. The Sonata performs every bit as well. I have over 60,000 miles and have all recommended manufacturers maintenance done. So for $800 of maintenance (plus regular oil changes) this car handles like new. I just replaced 2 tires recently and will replace other 2 next month."
"Great Vehicle  I drive 1100 miles a week, to work and back, and this car has been faultless for the past 23K miles.  And yes I do preventive maintenance, to assist this, such as 3K miles oil changes, tires, etc.  And have only really incurred the cost of four Yokohama 520 tires; which are superb on this vehicle.  Get one you'll be surprised at this good all round secret.  PS 32-33 mpg (95% highway)."
"Outstanding value  Bought this when our other car died. The interior and acceleration sold me and my wife. We have the 4 cylinder. No problem getting to highway speed off of ramp, and that speed is 70 mph. I make frequent 600 mile trips and check mileage. My last trip highway mileage was 31.5 ,  which is better than the sticker said. This was the last year for south Korean made sonatas. They are now made in Montgomery Alabama."
"I love my Mustang  I've had the car about six months now, and I absolutely love it.  The V8 engine has good power, and gets decent gas mileage (16-17 the way I drive it).  The car is a head turner, no question about it and it is reasonably comfortable for two; just consider the back seat as extra storage space.  The ride may be a little harsh, but holds well through corners, so I'll take it.  All in all, I love this car."
"grandma's car  My 85 yr old mother purchased this 2004 sonata gls new. Turned into on coming traffic and was hit head on, the other car was totaled she received only a minor bruise from the air bag. We hoped they would total it so he didn't have to put her back on the road. Ins fixed it, she no longer drives and I have been driving it. Now I am glad they repaired it, it's the best car I have ever owned. "
"Missing my Sonata  I bought my Sonata used and had it for two wonderful years before my 16 year old totaled it.  The car kept her perfectly safe and didn't even look back after the accident.  I cried when the insurance man said, ""total loss"".  That was the best car I have ever owned, I never had a single problem with that car.  It was so fun to drive and I loved the exterior style.  The gas mileage wasn't as good as I would have liked but I sure miss my Sonata.  I ordered a brand new Sonata today, I'm sold!"
"Best Car I ever owned.. Love it!!  As far as the driving its quiet and comfortable and we just love it.. It still is as quite as the day we bought it.  And the dealer, they are just as nice as the day we bought it. Very kind and considerate. Would buy again from them."
"Excellent Car  I purchased this car new and now have 104,000 miles on it.  I have all the recommended services performed and have had NO problems at all.  Very reliable and comfortable.  After 4 years, I still enjoy driving this vehicle.  I would recommend Hyundai to anyone wanting a lot of car for a lot less money than competitors."
"Great Car Very Safe   Excellent car  had it for 4 years only had to replace battery , thermostat, and brakes,  only maintenance i did was change oil every 3000 miles, change out coolant ,change timing belt and all other belts and air filters and of course oil filters and wiper blades  did NO other maintenance .  Car saved my life in a major accident recently.   Did excellent job in crash.   Was hit by other vehicle going 80 mph.  and I walked away with only minor bruises and a little soreness, of course was wearing seat belt,  But the car was totaled but I was unhurt for the most part.   Could not ask for better car.  Great gas mileage and reliability.  Get Gap Protection  it is worth the investment!! "
"Great Little Car  I purchased this car used with 58000 miles on it. The Carfax report said that it had been a rental in it's previous life. Despite that, this car looks great, drives great and even with a V6 is good with fuel economy. I have since put 12,000 miles on the car and have had no problems. Just put on some new tires and have been diligent with the oil changes. I hope this car performs for another 30,000 or so. Then it should be about time to buy a new Hyundai.(I'll get the warranty next time:)"
"Great Car  This is great car. My wife bought this car brand new. It is fun to drive and has been very reliable after 62,000 miles. We drove it all over the country to SC, FL, Phile, Kansas City, NYC, Cleveland, St. Louis, Gatlinburg. Good substitution for an Accord or a Camry. Great warranty on this also."
"MY BABY JAG!!!  My first car ever was the Excel she treated well through out those harsh Chicago winters.  So I moved up to the Elantra she treated well also.  So I said what the heck get the Sonata. I think the 2004 has the best body build of all the Hyundai's.  I love the quick speed pick up of that V6 engine, those horses just win durby evry time.  I have not attemped to use that shift gear, for what? I still get asked what kind of car is that when I am at the car wash. People call it a baby Jag.  The back spoiler I had installed gives it such a arrow dynamic look and feel. When I let my friend drive it one day and she drive up in it, I was like is that me!!!! Yes! I am very happy with my baby Jag "
"Great Car  Since new, this has been a great car.  It is quiet, powerful for a 2.7l engine and handles very well.  We have had only one issue with the starter where the Bendix drive slipped.  The starter turned but the engine didn't turn over.  Roadside assistance was here within an hour, took it to the local dealer and claimed to find nothing.  It has never done it again in over a year.  Its the best 17K I've spent on a car."
Great Car  I have been very happy with this purchase. The only downside is fuel economy. I usually get 21 MPG for non-highway traffic (and that is with climate control turned on). For a V6 the MPG is not bad.
"It Kicks and Screams Just Like New.  This vehicle truly owns the road. It's 
the Ford MUSTANG GT with a healthy kick
of 2000's technology. It kicks and 
screams just like the day it was born.
To prove it this might convince you I
was pulled over today dec. 1 2004 
by an officer not too far from the
Whitestone bridge for speeding.
It kicks and screams just like the day
it was born. That all american V-8
engine, floor it and hear that growl
like no other. The All American classic
FORD MUSTANG! It's our last American
muscle car. It's forever in our hearts. 
I love the pony logo on the seats and
steering wheel."
"OK car  I bought my Sonata 6/04 and traded it 4/07 with 77K miles.  It was comfortable, but with the 4cyl acceleration left something to be desired (with no MPG benefits to show- 22mpg, mostly hwy, in the winter, 24- 26 in the summer).  Reliability was questionable (in the shop 3 times with emissions issues, 1X brakes, 1X fuel pump).  My friend has a V6 Sonata with none of the issues, better MPG and much more power.  It was comfortable, interior used cheap materials but put together well, and I did like the car.  I will buy another Hyundai (but not when putting 25-30K miles a year on the car), may buy an Elantra or new Sonata to compliment my new BMW (2003 model) for when an auto trans would be nice."
Good Car for The Price  Like the styling and color. Performance is good for a small V-6 on the highway.  
"Hyundai changed my opinion of them...  I have driven this car for 32,000 miles plus from Fairbanks, Alaska down to Seattle, Washington and now down to Lompoc, California and I have not had one single problem!  Not one!!!"
"No not a Jag but a Hyundai!  Couldn't be happier with this car. We have owned it for three years now and still love it. Great looks, style and best of all this car has Lexus type of reliability. "
"Pleasantly Surprised  I purchased this veicle knowing that I had peace of mind with the warranty offered. what has been so nice is that I have not had to use the warranty. I have over 51,000 miles on my car and I have not had any problem at all! Not even a bulb go out."
Awesome car  i have driven my car almost 38000 miles in two+ years.   It is a beautiful car and I have had no problems with it other than the cassette stopped working.  I took it in and it was immediately replaced.   Gas mileage is around 28mpg. The seats could stand a bit more padding .  
"OK  Just totalled my car, for some reason the left rear tire came off on its own on highway and the car went into a ditch. No other problems, not sure whether any body else has had their tires come off."
"I love my Sonata  I have had my 2004 Sonata LX into the Service Department for regular oil changes and once for a rattle.  Other than that, it has been maintenance- free and a wonderful car to own.  I would happily buy it again given the same circumstances.  I bought it for the warranty but have really enjoyed driving it."
Excellent car best in class  The Sonata has been dream to own and drive. Excellent highway milage and great ride and handling in fowl weather!
Excellent choice  I got this car in January 2004 and on one trip I took from Florida to California I averaged 34.9 gallons per mile.  I set it on cruise control at the speed limit (which varied) and kept going.  Didn't check the mpg until I got there and needless to say I was pleasantly  surprised.  I am trading it in for a 2006 Santa Fe only because I need more hauling capacity for things I buy.
"Stangn'  Bought it......loved it....what more 
can i say.....i would recommend it to 
a friend, an enemy so i could make new 
friends:)......from the V6 to the 
Cobra its all good......although i bet 
the Cobra is funner"
"I love my Hyundai!  My husband and I have owned many cars from compact cars to SUVs, thus far my Hyundai Sonata has been my absolute favorite! It rides so smoothly and it has excellent safety features.  It has maintained mechanical stability since day one.  I recently had to purchase a new SUV in order to have more room for additional children, but I still love to take my Hyundai anytime the children are not with me!  I highly reccommend this car!"
Owner's Review  This vehicle is one of the best handling vehicles I have ever owned.  It is simply a fun car to drive.  Quality is top of the line when comparing other vehicles I have owned.  You just don't get tired of driving this car.
the way to go for less  I had to have a reliable and safe car in 2004 to take my wife for her cancer treatments.  The sonata filled the bill.
"Excellent Car     I've had this car for over two years now and its been very comfortable and reliable. A cv boot needed replacing a year ago, but was completely covered by the warrenty. Otherwise, the car has given me no problems. The ride is a little ""boaty"" and the gas mileage is something like 17 miles to the gallon. . .which in these times is not great. However, I feel it's a great deal for the money involved. "
"Hyundai Sonata  I travel about 4,000 mi a month in the NW, a lot of back roads to farms and ranches.  The car handles very well, excelent fuel milage (30 MPG) I can drive 600 Mi in a day and not be overly tired, extreamly confortable.  My car has the 2.4 L 4 Cly engine in it and i am pleased with the power. I plan to buy another hyundai when i need another car."
A great car!  This is a great little car! Has plenty of muscle for a four cylinder! Got it up to 80 mph with little effort. A true pocket rocket! I have the 5 speed transmission which adds to the performance. Handles well around sharp turns. Excellent craftmanship and looks. My next new car will be a Hyundai.
Great Car  I use this car for business and have found it to be reliable and comfortable. I drive approx. 30K a year and have had no mechanical problems. I had a problem with the std. radio/CD player but that was taken care of under warranty. The drivers side inside door handle chrome peeled and also was replaced under warranty. I would not hesitate to buy another Hyundai.
"2 hot 2 be stoped!  I love my Sonota. After trading in my 01' Toyota Echo, I had to get used to having power everything. Powerful 2.7 L V-6. Recived X-Type luxury for thousands less. I love my Sonota, however I have had to get my antenna replaced twice."
"Excellent Performance and Value  We looked several of the ""big boys""-Camry, Accord, Altima.  The Sonata came out on top for us because of its excellent rating on reliability. However, what really sold me was the smooth, comfortable ride.  I do a lot of freeway travel and I found that at at freeway speeds the Sonata is much more quiet and comfortable than any of the other aforementioned cars-even the Camry.  I get all kinds of compliments on the looks of the car too-something I've never gotten before on any other car I've ever ever owned.  I love this car."
Review of 2004 Hyundai Sonata V6 GLS  This is a great car.   I have not had any issues with this automobile except that ever since I've owned the car - since day one I have experienced severe sacroiliac pain because the seat is low and I twist to get out of the car.   The seats are pretty firm too. That took some getting used to.   I get many compliments on the car and it has been a good purchase except for the back pain issue.  
"Gar Review  The car is great overall and is 
extremely fun to drive. Turns heads, 
grabs attention, and with flowmasters 
40 series, H pipe, mid length headers, 
and a CAI it sounds great and quenches 
my thirst for speed. Not the classic 
5.0, but its fast. Love the interior, 
great to lean back and relax in, low 
but not low enough to scrape. 
Definately not a winter car, but beats 
all other cars ive owned in fun. 
Overall, a great car. "
"Happy Sonata Owmer  This car has been great. The ride is very good, the comfort is very good and it handles great. I like to looks and the overall design. The price was very good and you can't beat the warrantee or the company commitment to make you happy with the purchase."
Still love it!  I have had this car for almost two years and still love it! So does everyone else. People (several) have actually stopped me to ask about my car. They think it is expensive:)It is the first new car I have ever owned and we are now a Hyundai family. My sister bought a Tiburon yesterday. I thought it was cute but the Sonata has style!
"Worth the money!!!  My family owned this car and a 2005 Elantra.  We have owned 2 previous Elantras.  I went from driving a 2001 Infiniti I30.  We traded it in a an Elantra GT.  I loved the GT but needed a larger car, so we got this Sonata.  What a dream.  This  car reminds me of my Infiniti, WITHOUT the extra cost of premium unleaded gas.  This car has it all.  Great pickup, great radio and great overall value.  I love this car.  I recommend the 6 cyl. though.  The 4 cyl. doesnt have the pick up.  It is sluggish.  After driving it as a loaner car, we bought it.  I really recommend this car.  I love it!!!"
"Highest value mid-size sedan  If you rated this car on value per category it would rank 10 on all aspects. I rated this vehicle in comparison to other mid-size sedans in a similar category, such as the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. If you are looking for a car with a firm ride this is not the vehicle for you as it has a fair amount of body roll, sacrificed for the soft ride no doubt. Overall it is a fun car to drive and I would recommend it over any other mid- sized sedan primarily because of the cost. My fiancee bought this car a month ago for $10,700 with 22K miles. It is very comfortable for long trips and has ample space in the rear seat and trunk. The car looks very upscale both inside and out. "
"Wonderful Car  Overall, I love this car. The fuel economy is not quite as good as the competitors, but it's not bad. The low end tourque of the V6 is pretty weak, but once it gets going the car performs very well. passing on the highway is not a problem. The ride is extremely smooth, and quiet, and the car handles very well. The inside is confortable, and the standard features/price ratio was unmatched by any other car."
"Great car  This is my second sonata and have driven about 375,000 miles without any major issues.Still runs like new with lots of pickup.Never trouble with engine,transmission,or a/c."
Sonata a great value!  The Sonata is great value for your money. I've had one for 8 .5 years. Everything has been great with the possible exception of the tires.The original equipment tires had to be replaced at 28k. Everything else is good quality.I'm buying a new one .
"An old familiar face  This Sonata has been very kind to me. Extremely reliable. Total repairs required since I purchased the vehicle new has been one ball joint replaced. I never had so much as a bulb needing replacement (headlamps are still original) until 120,000 miles, when bothe brake lamps finally burnt out after almost eight years. Very comfortable for longer trips (I'm 6'5""/280 lbs.), and gas mileage has been on the high side of predicted. The engine does not consume or lose any oil, which I attribute to Hyundai quality and to having used Mobil 1 oil and oil filters every oil change. I actually prefer driving this Sonata more than my 2015 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Limited, which seems ponderous in comparison (though I love the gas mileage on longer trips). In my nearly eight years of ownership, the car has never failed to start, has never stranded me on the roadside, and has not so much as suffered a flat (sheer luck, I'm sure). I've owned eight Hyundai vehicles since 1999, and I believe this has been my favorite."
"My door handles fell off!  Within a 3-week span last year (2017), 3 of my door handles came off in my hand.  No rough treatment, just opening the doors.  The car was only 6 years old.  I jury-rigged a rope and pulley system to open the driver door through an open back window.  Sweet. I called Hyundai to see if these were covered by their much-touted 10-year warranty.  No, door handles are only covered for 5 years.  Apparently people should just naturally expect them to only last that long and should plan to get them repaired after that.  If you can get into your car to drive them to a shop..."
Great Purchase 2010 Sonata GLS  Best used vehicle.Extremely clean inside and out! Just one owner previous. Low mileage and smooth ride.
"Good Car for me  I have always liked the Ford Mustang.  
My first and second cars were both 
Mustangs.  Although I am somewhat 
unhappy with the 2004 (I could not 
afford the GT), I have more good to say 
about it than bad.  I enjoy driving it 
daily to and from work. Acceleration is 
quick with the manual transmission and 
gas mileage is still pretty good for a 
V-6.  The seats aren't the best, but 
I'm not uncomfortable in them."
"LOVE THE CAR  My dad brought 2010 at a auction with only 92,000 miles on it. It had two repairs that needed to be done, TPMS and engine light on. Got both repair along with oil change, etc. The car runs excellent, body is good and runs so smooth."
Great value  This was a great value for a car.  I put over 185 thousand miles on it without major repair.  Very good vision out front with little roof piller vision obstruction.  Inside roomy and confortable for crusing interstates.
"Can't get into my car  Two of my door handles just fell off in a one month period, rear driver side and front passenger doors, pretty soon I won't be able to enter my car. Hyundai told me get it fixed and they will decide if or what they will pay after I submit the receipt. This is a quality of material and workmanship issue. I have a 2010 sonata, until this I was extremely satisfied with my vehicle.  Not very happy with their customer service."
"dependable,reliable, and inexpensive to maintain  I bought the car used in 2010 with 30,000 miles on it for $11,000. So far with regular maintenance I've had to do nothing but brakes, tires and a battery. I now have 156,000+ and still amazed on how well it runs. I still get 34 mpg on the Hwy and 28+ mixed driving. It was driven daily to and from work 100 miles round trip for 4 years and then recreational driving after retirement for 2 years. Throw in a round trip cross country loan to my daughter , multiple heavy trips to Home Depot, good in the snow, brakes stop on a dime, only had to use the ESC once on an abrupt lane change to avoid an accident ( kind of freaked me out how the car took over) . Everything works as well as the day I bought it A/C, transmission, water pump , power steering etc.Update on review, One year and later 28,000 miles . Only mechanical problem was a wheel bearing on the rear passenger side. repaired and replaced for under $50. still running strong.UPDATE 3/25/2018 171,000 miles and I could have written the same review today, great car would buy again in a heart beat"
Great car for a reasonable price  I really like this car and feel it was a great investment.  It gets great mileage and has a comfortable ride.
Easy to own  It is a great car for the money.  The fit and finish is good.  It is holding up well.  It still feels almost new although it has very low mileage.
"Stiff Ride  If you do much driving on rough roads be prepared for a hard ride. Otherwise I love this car. Roomy, easy to drive, great in the snow, handles corners beautifully. Would like it a little less road noise but not too bad."
"No regrets, this is a keeper  This is not a luxury car, but it is a great highway cruiser and very easy on gas.  Power drivers seat is very comfortable for long distance driving."
"good car except door handles  Just wanted to add my experience to the list.  Have had 2 outside door handles break off.   Owned maybe 20 cars in 45 years, never had one door handle break off until this one. Have trouble reading the clock in the daylight."
"My first Hyundai - A Great Automobile.  Car handles well in all weather conditions. Comfortable to drive.Good visibility. Lots of room when rear seats folded down.Car has good balance, low tire wear.I have 128,000km on rear tires and don't have to change them yet.Front tires changed at 115,000 km. No problems from new - One warranty issue to have transmission re-programmed - solved rough shifting that had developed. Quiet on both city roads and highway. Dash is great, easy to read, and controls very accessible. Almost feels like a full size car inside.Have purchased 2013 Sonata GLS and have kept 2010 as a second car.Very reliable. "
"40th Anniversary Edition  Bought my wife a mustang after 33 years 
of her yearning for one.  Tried the  v-
6, too slow, bought the GT w/ 5 speed.  
Took a month to adjust the seats right. 
Turned a 9.3/72 mph in the 1/8th out-of-
the-box and that was with an RT of 
about a year.  Super ride, good MPH (27)
the most fun car I've had since '71.  
No problems in 10000 miles at all.  Red 
line is about 6300 RPM.  Excellent, 
comfortable car."
"Broken door handle, door lock, fuel cap and counting..  I was excited initially with the value of the car but after four years I am now wondering. First problem I had was with engine light code 442, went to dealer two times but they keep claiming it is a loose fuel cap issue. I am making sure the cap is tight after every fill and even changed cap with new oem cap still this issue is persistent. Then I had one remote door lock issue which was fixed with a new lock. Now I have one broken door handle. When I searched about door handle, it was surprised to know that it is a known issue with this car as the door handles are made of cheap plastic not metal like other car and easily breaks. Not sure if I will consider Hyundai brand again."
"Here's hoping  I have had this car since March of 2010, and most of the time, it is trouble free, but there are quirks that make me think of turning it in.I commute 82 miles a day, and have 61K on the car.Everything was fine for the first 30k miles.Then, it developed a problem with the fuel tank where it wouldn't take gas, and this took the dealer a month to resolve.Then, the transmission started thumping.The dealer did a reset twice and replaced the fluid, but the thumping started again at 59K.The dealer says they will replace the transmission if they find the condition again, but the problem is that the thumping comes and goes, and when its time to take it to the dealer, the thumping stops."
Door Handles  I have a 2010 Hyundai Sonata and it sucks. 3 of the car door handles have broken off in the last month. They will not pay for them. I have read other reviews and this is a on going problem. Hyundai tried to say they haven't heard of this before. But I guess they haven't read the reviews. I will never buy another on. my son has a 2008 and he has had many other problems. Alternator is only one of the problems he has had with him. 
Poor Quality Car  The mileage of the car will drop significantly. The door handles will snap in cold temperatures and will not be covered and will cost the consumer dearly
"perfect sales rep. vehicle  Bought my Sonata new 2 1/2 years ago.Currently have 94,000 miles on her.High miles due to my profession as a sales rep. covering 5 states.Only one problem was a check engine light at around 40K - dealer said it was some problem with the fuel cap.No problems since.Routinely get 32 mpg highway. I have owned 32 cars since 1977.This one and HondaAccords have been the best for ride, comfort, gas mileage, and reliability.Left the sales rep. job 8 months ago, so I won't be driving the usual 50K per year. I intend to keep this one for another 10 years."
"Faulty Brakes  This is the second Sonata that i owned. The first was a 2007 and the brakes and rotors needed changing at 45000 miles, at the first service the tech said that the brakes would not release, warantee work cost $75. When I got the next one a 2010 I was told that the brake system was corrected, now at 22000 miles I had to change the pads and rotors. LAST HYUNDAI I WILL OWN.Pads and rotors from Amazon cost $88 Delivered. The h... with the dealer."
"Good car, with caveats  I purchased this car new in December 2009.Two years and 44,000 miles later, I've got mixed feelings.I commute 65 miles per day (90% hwy) and routinely achieve 33-34 mpg. It's large, comfortable and has been largely trouble-free except for a repainted hood (flaking paint) at 30K and a transmission failure at 39K.Both repairs were covered under warranty.The rebuilt transmission they've installed seems fine, and I'm cautiously optimistic about the car's future.That being said, a new transmission at 39K doesn't give me much confidence.I'm very meticulous on maintenance, so I'm hopeful that'll pay off."
"Trial and error car  This is the first foreign car we have purchased.We chose it based on statistics and very affordable price.We have owned it over 2 years and while a good car, not overly impressed.Still giving it time to see what happens.I have yet to get the gas mileage reviews quote.I average 22-26 mpg."
"Excellent car!!!!  I now have 17, 000 miles on my Sonata.It is a great performer.I have owned Honda's, Nissan's, Chevy's and Mazda's in the past.The Hyundai's quality, ride and performance is equal and better than the competitors(in my opinion).I rent cars to save miles and I always enjoy coming home to my Sonata!!!"
"Fantastic GLS!!  I purchased this 2010 vehicle recently and I have absolutely no complaings.I am use to driving a mini-van and love the comforts of the size, storage, and power.Due to gas costs I looked for a smaller vehicle with the comfort of a minivan and one that I could afford.I absolutely love this car.This car has so much power to be a 4 cylinder and the gas mileage is fantastic.The technology and comfort is amazing.This even has cruise control--on a standard!Rides like a dream, quiet, and even on bumpy roads it is smooth.I love my car and you will too!"
"Great Mustang!  I've had my 06 Mustang GT for two and a half years. Overall, I love this car! The modern-retro look, the powerful v-8, the American-muscle rumble, its got it all. I always love driving it, even in my routine communites. In the world full of soccer mom mini-vans, clunky pick-up trucks, and ho-hum sedans, it feels good driving a car that stands out and demands attention. This just doesn't become a ""daily driver car"" like your grand am, accord, or malibu. This car becomes a part of you. You'll eventually end up giving this car a name like Shelby, Sally, or Eleanor. This is the type of car that you pass down to your children. So, buy one, throw in your fav AC/DC album, and drive and live!"
"It is what it is  I'v had my 04 Mustang GT a little less 
then a year now. I pretty much got it 
as a weekend car. I have only put about 
3500 miles on it so far, so I can't 
really judge the build quality too 
well. The interior is pretty cheap, 
with large gaps in a few spots, and the 
seats are not that comfortable. But it 
is what it is. No one buys a Mustang 
thinking its a Cadilac. You know what 
kind of car your getting in to. Its a 
farily inexpensive, great looking, 
fast, pure American Muscle Car. Not too 
many cars can touch this performance 
for the price. I would not recomend 
this as your only car, but as a second 
car its amazing. Its all a moot point 
anyway, because the new one are out now."
"Love it!  I traded in a 2008 Mazda Tribute for the 2010 Hyundai Sonata.  I wanted something with better gas mileage and a better interior design- I found it! I love my Sonata and do not feel like I lost much interior space going from the small SUV to a sedan. I ended up with a cheaper payment, better gas mileage, and a vehicle that I believe will be more reliable long-term. It handles well and is fun to drive! I'm very happy with my purchase."
"Lovin it  Purchased for the mpg and it has not disappointed. Quiet, comfortable on my 80 round trip everyday. A bigger fuel tank and much better mileage than my old Buick. A little buzzy at 75+ mph but I shouldn't be driving that fast anyway."
"Car Failed At High Speeds  My Sonata has been great for the 8 months I owned it until last week.  While driving at 65 mph on a highway, the car died, completely shut down.  Nothing I could do but wait to be hit from behind, which I was. The dealer inspected the car and told me the battery cable connection was very loose which probably caused the problem.  The car lost its power connection.  Today I learned that this may have been a dealer error as the car battery is charged just prior to turning it over to the buyer, and no maintenance on the car in these 8 months would have involved doing anything to this cable.  Dealer won't take any responsibility.  Another case of screwing the consumer.  I could have been killed."
"Hankook Tires   Great car, fun to drive. The main problem are the Hankook tires as they wore out in less than 1 year. Only 18,000 miles on car and now I need to spend $600.00 for new tires. hankook tires would NOT even pro-rata tires. Avoid these tires, absolute JUNK!"
"My New Car  I love the car, luxury for me compared to what I am used to. Fuel millage better than I thought I would get, XM radio a plus, will keep until free time is up. Very comfortable, sight lines are excellent, sound system is great for a rock-n-roller, "
"Not So Bad After All  I had my heart set on a 2010 Kia Forte EX, but due to financing issues I got the Hyundai Sonata, and I must admit I'm completely BLOWN AWAY! The Sonata I got was a former rental so it was well taken care of and the price was amazing! I did really good going up Interstate 5, it handles very well, but can be a little shaky on tight turns. The interior is nice and has plenty of room for my daughters infant seat in the back seat, and it has a HUGE trunk. I love that it comes standard with all the bells and whistles that are optional on other brands (ie. XM radio, CD/MP3, air conditioning, power locks and windows). Overall not a bad buy. I really like my Sonata! Great car for HWY driving."
"Sonota Odor  When I purchased my 2010 Sonota I was told that a chemical odor in the car was associated with a metal protector applied to  a new engine at the factory and it would burn off shortly after driving it awhile.  After a year, the odor did not go away.  In that year, I brought the car back to the dealer on several occasions to complain about it.  The dealer acknowledged the smell was present  and tried to remove the odor once by cleaning the car.  They admitted  they could not remove the odor. Except for odor, the car has been great (just like my previous Sonota).  Unfortunately, I no longer recommend buying Hyundai cars.  Hyundai does not stand behind their product after they make the sale."
"Why you might  consider Sonata 2010  If you are tight on cash and need to save those $2000 but don't want to buy a second hand car. I mean $2000 could buy you 2 years of gas. I will only compare this one to 2008 Accord and 2006 Camry because i have driven them both. The driver's seat is not as firm, steering is not as nimble and car has a floaty feel to it. Suspension is not as tight. The dashboard plastic crackles once in a while. The mileage is great, controls are easy and well placed. I saved $2000 on similarly equipped Camry and accord."
Great car  The ride on a long trip is great! I've made 2 long trips (over 2000 miles each) My first trip I averaged 34 mpg and the second trip only 32.5. On good pavement the car is very quiet at 70 mile per hour. On some pavement at that speed there is an annoying sound. In town the mileage is only 22-24. The ride is soft and comfortable both on a long trip and in the city. In the city at slower speed the car is very quiet. 
"2010 Preowned Former Rental - GREAT DEAL  It isn't often that I buy a car new off the lot. I saw this 2010 in the preowned area and inquired. It was a former rental which at first most people balk at when seen. I will say that I will never buy a used car that WASN'T a rental first. It was immaculate, like new and had 30,000 miles on it. The dealer had all the maintenance records and CARFAX report on-site. The rental company changed the oil every 3,000 miles and did all manufacturer recommended maintenance religiously. I have had the Sonata a week now and it drives wonderfully. The handling is fine for a car of its size. Also, Hyundai allows the transfer of the 10/100,000 to another owner; so I still have 30,000 miles left to go.BRAVO"
"Aw, Not Bad!  well, i've had this vehicle for 3months 
now as a used vehicle 2003 with 30,000 
miles. it's a beautiful car, has 
adequate power, very nice ride, but i'm 
now having to question the mechanical 
dependability since i've had to put 
this vehicle in the shop twice. first, 
the fuel pump had to be replaced after 
i noticed a ""service engine soon"" 
light. 2 weeks later, another ""service 
engine soon"" light. now, it's the 
computer system that has to be 
replaced. one more major repair, and 
the vehicle goes back. thank goodness, 
it's still under factory warranty!!"
"A True Road Warrior  We have been following the improving Hyundai quality and value stats for several years.  When we needed a daily driver, we decided on the Sonata GLS PZEV.  It is not a sprinter but in the passing range of 60 - 85 it is quite surprising! My wife puts 120K+ miles per day on the car in high speed traffic.  The safety features were paramount as well as the handling and mileage.  With well over 30K miles, no problems and averaging over 28 mpg at speed, we are extremely pleased.  The Dealership is better than my MB group. The styling is vanilla, but that is great given the number of speed traps on her route. Bluetooth and XM rounded out the package for her.  She comes home with a smile on her face"
"Replaced my '99 with a 2010 and LOVE IT!  I had a '99 Sonata GLS prior to this one. It was a VERY reliable car for 10 years and 138,000 miles so I looked at the new model. WOW, I'm impressed. Even my new husband, an old school gear head, loves driving it. I won't say how fast my husband has had this car going, but the speedometer limit is not wishful thinking.  The Sonata has a very roomy interior and all the comfort we love but the zippiness of the car still allows us to have fun. Have put 4500 miles on it in 3 months and not even a minor defect yet.  On a recent long distance trip we got 32 mpg (and I do NOT drive slow). I average 24-25 on combined highway/city driving."
So far It Rocks!  Well this is my first Hyundai and we bought it on a total whim!! The salesman was great and the car rides and performs like none other I have owned. Love the performance of the V6 and the handling of the car. Also the size of the trunk is great. If this is how all Hyundais are I am a Hyundai guy for life!
reliable but  A good reliable car although I only have 9000 miles on it. Excellent gas mileage. I have a problem with my alarm going off in hot weather for no reason - anybody know of this problem and a solution. The carpets don't fit right - not cut correctly in driver's foot well or in trunk. Nice exterior finish but I already have more chips out of it than my 10 year old Volvo - hidden warranties?
"Ford is the past!  I've driven Ford's for the past 25 years and I fell in love with the Taurus, however it had major engine, trans and elect. problems with poor warranties.  I've had the Sonata 5 days now and need to get used to the stiff steering of the Sonata, the body style of 2010 is bland, but the interior rocks with the XM radio, auto sunroof and roomy design.  Great price the the car including good warranty. . "
"Very nice car for the money  I bough this car with 5100 less than invoice with the manufacturer rebate included. I like the color. It has some many luxury features. The only thing that I do not like is the gas mileage. It is supposed to make 22 mpg in the city, but does only 18.5 mpg. I have not tested in the highway. I especially like the fuel usage computer in the car. I am sure the heated front seats will come handy during cold winter months. The build quality is very good. It feels like an expensive car."
Nice car for the money  So far no problems with the car. Drove it for 3 months and 3200 mi. It looks to me that ac should blow colder air but its not summer yet so we will see later. Getting only 25 mpg driving mostly on highway. The best I got was 28 mpg but I had to drive slow not exceeding 70 mph
"Good car for the money - mostly  I have had this car for over two months and have taken two substantial trips with it, in addition to daily city driving.  Plusses: fabulous pick- up; good performance; decent comfort; roomy; fairly smooth ride (especially when fully loaded with passengers); GREAT highway mileage -- my record so far: 38.4 mpg (single occupant, A/C, minimal luggage, flat topography, cruise control, 65-68 mph);  Minuses:  can't seem to fill tank up without the pump auto-shutting off at about 2/3 full; mysterious fresh petroleum odor from air-vents, especially when idling; confusing/ambiguous/redundant- looking A/C temp/fan controls; auto headlights don't seem to activate easily enough (e.g., when rainy, cloudy)"
"2010 GLS 4cyl  Just completed a 2000 mile trip to Kansas from Georgia. The car was very comfortable, handled the rough interstates well, averaged 33 mpg, and held all of our luggage easily. Car replaced a 2001 mini-van. We miss the room, but the car's performance far exceeds the trade-off for room. "
"Camry Killer This Car Stops  I drove the Toyota's Camry. However it cost $ 6000 more, and it's reputation has taken a lot of hits lately.. This is the first time in a long time I walked away without buying a Camry. This car has truly surpassed Camry. It has Every safety feature, air bags, traction controls, side airbags etc. I get 27 mpg around town. Great brakes. This car stops. Easy to get in and out of this car. Almost everything is standard. XM radio, comfortable seats, plenty of room, enormous trunk. We love this car. The best Sonata so far, and getting the car at dealer invoice, and a $ 2500 rebate just made it sweeter."
"Pony Performance  Thos is an awesome car to own and 
drive. Shes very dependable and corners 
very well. I love this Special Edition 
Mustang and it is the 3rd Mustang I 
have owned. I am surprised that I get 
28 miles to the gallon with cruise set. 
When i need the power, its there with 
no hesitation. I have had a little 
trouble with the air conditioning 
system but the dealer repiared it after 
several trips. I am very happy with 
this Mustang. I love it!!!"
perfect for starting a family  me and my wife recently bought a Sonata and we both love it its comfortable and reliable.our daughter loves makeing messes in it but it is definatly big enought to get the gold fish out on a quick fast and hurry standard for the first new car that dad has owned.roomyness was the key with this car meaning we could put the stroller 2 million bags that baby needed and then mom and dads one shared army duffle bag in the trunk. the acceleration is great and this mid size will definatly keep up and leave thoese tailgateing mustang gts. trust me i have done it. the braking is very reassuring especially when it comes to you or the garage door. and its fun to drive. more fun then my last sports car
"happy camper  great car for the price,paid 18k cash but was able to barter in many upgrades in power options and protection package etc... have 500 miles on it and very pleased so far. I was very skeptical about hyundai,dont be!even with gm employee discounts and rebates they beat malibu's price and I like the sonata better. built in u.s.a. hurray!"
"Never thought I'd be driving a Hyndai!  But I am and proud of it!  I had a 1998 neon that I bout used, I decided to treat myself to a new car.  I had totally settled on the 2010 Altima.  I was at the dealership looked across and saw the Sonata.  Boy am I glad I did. This car is great, my husband would never be caught dead in my neon, now I can't keep him out of my Hyundai.  The price was great and the 0% finance was on time.  Needless to say my first new car buying experience was great thanks to Hyundai.  I got the slate blue and I receive daily compliments on how immaculate the paint jobs is.  I'm still stuck up not letting anyone eat or drink a thing in my car.  Owned it 7 weeks now and have not a regret!  Go Hyundai! "
"A lot of car for the price  I drive fifty mile to work one way. This car is fuel efficient, comfortable and reliable. Suspension sounds loose, but performs nice. There is a lot of car for the price."
"Best car I ever drove  I purchase Hondas and Acuras all my life. Had bad experience with transmissions with my  Accord and Odyssey. I had to replace transmissions four times. when I complained and didn't want to pay, they gave me a nasty attitude. I told them I will never buy Hondas again. they didn't care. When time came I did test drive many different cars but fell in love with the Sonata. It was perfect for me. I never thought in million years I would buy a Hyundai. I have it for a week now and still in love. Great price and mileage. up to 29 MPG mixed driving. "
"Camry Killer @ $15K  The manual transmission has a learning curve for the ""Hyundai"" clutch bite. But all is well given the necessary muscle memory to produce clean first and second gear shifts. Pedals seem close together and not power adjustable here. Tilt wheel, not telescoping. Nice seat height handle.  The ride is smooth and quiet if not cream puff. The engine is refined and willing. The interior is both big and expensive looking with a quality fit and finish. Although the door lock button feels cheap as a light weight plastic. There is a big trunk with a split fold down rear seat.  We are still above 1/2 a tank with 250 miles showing. The XM radio has spoiled us and our livingroom Lazyboy misses us.  "
"Excellent car for the Money!!  I had owned a Hyundai Sonata 2007 but unfortunately totaled my car in an accident in December. I just loved that car and my heart broke! I didn't have to think twice about what car I would get.  I went straight to Atlantic Hyundai and purchased another Sonata 2010.  I got a terrific price, $2500 off. The interior of the car has improved and the sound system is great.  It feels solid when you drive it and gives a smooth ride.  The features on the steering wheel are great too and have improved from the  2007 models.  It feels like a sturdier car. I LOVE IT!!!"
"Great Midsize Car for the Price  Have this car less than a month. Very nice ride when the road is not too bumpy, the designers should travel on Pennsylvania roads to fine tune the suspension.  Superior interior design, & comfortable seating. Gas mileage seems to be 26-27MPG so far. Overall I'm pleased. Got a good price with a $2500 rebate and a $1000 rebate with my 07 Toyota Corolla trade in. Interior very roomy. "
"Hyundai quality   I like the quality expressed in the ""feel"" of the car. The SE 6 cylinder engine is very responsive. The transmission is fun specially with the manual feature. The radio sounds excellent. The seats are comfortable. This is a good quality car, solid. "
"Happy so far  1800 miles in 6 weeks. 4 things I would like to see:softer ride,less road noise especially on uneven roads,softer(more cushiony) leather seats & folding side view mirrors. Controls easy to work. Navigation system easier than Toyota. Priced right. It looks like a winner."
"Fun to Drive  This is my first sports car and I love 
it! My Mustang and I get the attention 
of everyone around us. The ride is a 
bit rough, but it's worth it. Thank you 
Ford for keeping the Mustang around for 
me and my family to enjoy."
"It does everything well  After leasing my first four new cars (all GM), I settled on buying and truly evaluated a lot of options in the midsize category, foreign and domestic.  I was sold on the Sonata from the first test drive.  I've driven 2,600 miles so far, and here's my conclusion: it's a car that isn't exceptional in any one area, but does just about everything well.  It feels solid and well built inside and out, offers a great blend of power and fuel economy (no worries about highway merging/passing), holds a lot of cargo and offers great value for the money.  Not to mention the fantastic warranty.  Hyundai has a real winner here."
"Impressive Car  Bought early January with 5000$ discount from MSRP. (paid 15K with Camry trade in). SE really made for commuter who looks for better handling with good comfort. This is not really sports edition, but good for drivers who commutes highway and local roads every day. SE shows good grip with responsive handling and smooth ride. Comparison with 2002 Camry, this is the better car with great handling, quite cabin and better ride. Brakes is much better than Camry and MPG is almost same as Camry. Ride is a pleasure than Camry's dull boring ride. Have driven 1400 miles now and have been really satisfied with the car. Hyundai made a long way to the quality and performance."
Love this car!!!  I have owned this car for just over a month now.  It is my first new car in 10 years.  I love the way it handles and the V6 power is just right.  The limited has so many features included that you pay for in other models.  I love the sound system (upgraded with the Limited package).
What a surprise  You think you would be hesitant with a name like Hyundai. Don't be fooled. After you take a test drive your going to love this car. I just purchased my Sonata Limited and already I know I made the right choice. After my niece saw my car the next day she visited the Hyundai dealer. You get the feeling of a solid built car with all the goodies. Thanks Hyundai for introducing me to a well built car. I'll follow up with another review after my first 500 miles
Time to pull the Trigger!  Been looking at the Sonata since it's redesign in 2006 but the Interior Revamp they did in 2009 sealed the deal. My '96 Saturn was now on it's last legs and finally last week I had to pull the trigger 'cause I didn't want to spend any more on repairs. I had also seen the pics of the 2011 Sonata due out later this year and just considered it too flashy for my tastes and decided to grab a 2010 while I could. The $3000 discount helped too since they only gave me $500 for the Saturn which will be immediately sent to Auction.  The bottom line is I got a Std GLS with everything already included that I wanted for the last 3 years. I'm glad I did my homework and Edmunds helped. 
"A Lot of Car For The Money  After a pleasant ownership experience with our 2007 Tucson, we traded for this Sonata after researching all the sedans in this general price range. This car offers plenty for the budget buyer, and rivals the usual suspects in MPG, options and quality. I saw the design of the 2011 model and it definitely turned me off. Way too angular and edgy, IMHO. This Sonata, to me, at a glance reminds me of one of my favorite cars, the Toyota Avalon. There is plenty of room inside, a HUGE trunk, and a peppy (if not tire-squealing)4cyl that seems to just sip gas. I wish the headlights did not have such a marked line between the light and dark, and the speedometer needs to be redesigned.Overall, great car."
"2nd Sonata  I had an '06 Sonata and loved it.  Unfortunately it was totaled in a wreck.  I came out of the wreck with only an abrasion on my wrist from the air bag going off.  I didn't even test drive another car.  Bought a '10 Sonata and love the improvements from the '06.  The added subtle chrome on the exterior (limited model) and the redesigned interior is awesome. I owned a Honda before my '06 Sonata, what an over-rated vehicle.  The fit, finish and overall quality was poor (it felt & looked cheap).  The fit, finish and quality of the Sonata is second to none.  Hyundai has come a long since they first came to the US.  Remember the first Honda's and Toyota's?  I think my Sonata has a lot of class."
"our third hyundai  After looking at the accord and Camry we again bought a Hyundai.  this our third hyundai and as a someone with a family who is middle class I really cant see buying anything else.  This car is fully loaded with navigation, voice command, sunroof, xm stereo, etc.  A comparably equipped toyota or honda was priced over 5k more.  After two weeks we have been very pleased!!"
"AWSOME  All I can say is this is a great car...I had a nissan sentra before my Sonata and it is like I'm gliding on the road instead of feeling every bump.I'm very happy with my car its nice and roomy and good on mileage and it runs great!! Thank you Hyundai,you are Awesome!!"
"Sold on a Hyundai Sonata  I've driven Toyotas all my life and they've served me well. I thought I'd never buy anything different (except maybe upgrade to a Lexus one day). This time around, I considered less expensive alternatives given the economy and all.   I test drove the Hyundai Sonata GLS and it felt very similar to a Camry inside and out.  The kicker for me was the price--I paid over $3K less for my Sonata than the lowest quote for a Camry. I remember Hyundai's quality/reliability issues when the entered the US market in the 80s.  But the 10year/100k warranty comforted me enough to make the switch. Of course, the Hyundai brand does not get the same respect as Toyota/Honda. But that might change soon."
"Diehard 'Stang Fan  I haven't had this much fun driving 
since my 1973 Mach I. Still a new car, 
I'm learning that I like it more each 
day. Much quicker than my '68 289 
coupe, suspension is firm, though a 
little squirrely in the corners, but 
you can learn to adapt. Driver's seat 
puts my right leg to sleep on any drive 
longer than an hour. Great sound, both 
from the exhaust pipes or awesome sound 
system. I just look for reasons to 
drive this baby."
"It's a car that's good at being a car.  The 2010 Hyundai Sonata (5th gen) is the car you want to get if you're shopping in the midsize/family car segment. It has what you want for the right price - about $5000 lower than its competitors.  The powertrain is responsive, steering is slow but acceptable, the interior and trunk are very roomy, and nothing seems out of place. The exterior isn't too radical and the interior is nicely designed."
"A wonderful car  I just purchased my V6 Limited, Black on Black, and am very impressed by this car.  I traded an 06 Accord V6 EX-L, arguably the benchmark for the class.  The Sonata has a more sophisticated look inside and out than the Honda, and a more refined ride.  The Accord was very athletic in it's suspension tuning, but was also harsh at times.  The Sonata is lighter on it's feet, more like a dancer than an athlete.    The interior is outstanding. Refined elegance is how I would describe it.  The designers clearly sweated the details inside and out.  The Sonata is tuned towards a luxury feel and look, and for me provided a better balance of style, ride and comfort. "
"Trashed my Camry and discovered a Gem   I had previously owned a 2000 Toyota Camry, what a piece of junk. It was falling apart. Needless to say I was looking for a new car for around 16,000. I am 6'4 and 320lbs, so I needed something roomy. I was not looking for a hyundai but the 4,000 rebate offered on the 2010 sonata, warranted a test drive. I first drove an automatic, but my love of 5 speeds and with a savings of about a grand, I went with a fully loaded GLS manual. I am very pleased with the acceleration and smooth ride. This car has extremely good build quality. My mom's 30,000 dollar Chevy truck has a cheaply made interior compared to my sonata. I find it hard to find any flaws in this car. You just simply cannot beat the price and the options you get for that price. I have put about 1800 miles on my baby, so far. I only spend 30 bucks a week on gas! My only complaint is the creaking noise in the dash on cold days and I think the front leg room could be improved, but I am 6'4, so any car is a tight squeeze for me. I hope to drive this car for 100,000 miles or more. Trust me if you are looking to spend 22,000 on a new camry or accord, go look a a sonata, I bet you'll be sold after the first test drive. "
"Left Toyota for the Sonata  I went to the Toyota dealership with every intention of buying a Camry, having had one for 10 years.  I had already checked out the Sonata previously.  After test driving the Camry, I came away convinced the Sonata was the way to go.  Everything from the size of the trunk, the cloth on the seats, the style of the dash and the room in the back seat were superior on the Sonata.  So I left a very good deal on the Camry and bought the Sonata and havn't regretted it yet.  Took a 500 mile round trip already and got 32+ mpg.  Ease of use of the controls and their placement a big plus. Car is tight and fun to drive.  Great acceleration from the 4- cyl engine.  I was hesitant to go Hyundai, don't be."
"Great Value  After 2200 miles, I am very satisfied with this car. The 4 cylinder has plenty of power for my needs. Fuel economy is impressive for a car its size, 27-29 MPG, mixed driving, in an area with a lot of hills.  Very comfortable, great legoom in the back seat for the kids.  I will typically keep a car over 100k miles, so low lifetime cost of ownership is a big factor. The 2.4 liter engine has a timing chain, so there are no expensive TB canges to worry about. Auto transmission service interval up to 100k mi."
"Hyundai Sonata Suppiority  Handles great, it is very responsive, it takes off like a sports car and accelerates very fast, looks great, brakes very well.  I have had no issues except regular maintenance.  I would give the Hyundai Sonata a 8.9 out of 10"
"Think twice  Cheap plastic on some of the interior controls. Scratch very easily. Also, the black paint that was painted on some surfaces starts to come off after a few years. Poor trade in value. The turbo 2.0 engine is great however. Lots of power when you need it or just want to play. But, the engine and road noise are very loud. On some roads you literally have to shout to be heard. Not fun for long trips."
Had better but not bad  Basic edition fee extras front wheel drive traction poor in rain had in ice and snow!
"Great Car  Very economical to operate and maintain, and it uses regular gas!"
Excellent auto for cost.  Drives like sport car.  Very durable for low mileage car.
"Not too bad  Nice looking and even a better price.  
Fun to drive...no doubt.  Horsepower is 
ok but I would always like more.  The 
only complaint is gas mileage.  Not 
even close to what the window sticker 
says.  Wouldn't mind the gas mileage i 
am getting if it had more power.  
Overall, a good inexpensive sports car."
"Biggest Lemon  My 2012 Hyundai Sonata Limited 2.0t on the outside/inside appear to look nice and comparable to a high end luxury vehicle. Mechanically it is garbage! Owning this car for 3years  90,000 I had to the replace turbo sensor, fuel pump, 2 batteries, and run into multiple situations where the car would not start. Hyundai corporate and dealerships have been useless and do not stand by their products. This is my second and last Hyundai buying, next time I'll put the money towards a Toyota, a company who stands by their products and who has proven reliability."

"A Plethora of Bad Experiences  Do not buy this Car !!! A couple of months after I bought this car , the check engine light comes up when I was driving home from work. I take it to hyundai and they replace the High Pressure Fuel pump. At the same time I noticed there were other recalls for my car and had them check the engine for trouble. Hyundai gave it a clean bill of health. Fast forward 3 months , I`m driving down Ontario 4012 , suddenly there is a loud metallic knocking sound from the front and the car dies. I have it towed to a mechanic close by and he tells me the Engine is out and I will have to replace the Engine. I take it to hyundai and they tell me the car is out of warranty ( 140k Kms) and they wouldn`t do anything about it (Cooksville Hyundai Mississauga). Long story short , I spent 5000$ to get the Engine fixed and traded it in for a new vehicle. Very sour taste in my mouth and will never buy from Hyundai as long as I live."
"Love my car.  This car is totally awesome. After about 6 months, these are my main complaints:1. Seats are hard as rocks.2. Steering is sloppy. Tons of play at TDC make it hard to maintain lane discipline.3. Turbo lag-brutal.4. Poor gas mileage. At my best: 23mpg"
"I wish the experience was better.  I will never buy a Hyundai Sonata again. From the first month I own the car, it has been in out of the dealer twice a month. The greatest problem has been the engine,currently waiting for a replacement engine, then the tall lights and can't forget the front end problems."
"Lots of issues after 3.5yrs  At first, I thought. i was smart in buying the Sonata over Accord or Camry, now I regret it. In a few words, car started to fail me in many ways, such as airbag malfunction (light says it's not active), headlights frequently burn out, muff, and it will cost over $1.5k to fix), muffler noise ( time and $400 to fix), sunroof noises (really annoying), cracked axel (wth?), and a bunch of small, annoying issues I don't care for or have time to deal with. It was great at first, but the unreliability is starting to show. Pretty disappointed, so I won't be buying Hyundai again."
"Engine Failure  I had an engine failure with about 17,000 miles on the car.  The engine was replaced, but was not the same car.  Competitively priced vehicle, but my experience with Hyundai, dealer services and customer service has been two stars or less.   Everybody has different experiences with vehicles, for Hyundai, mine could have been better."
"Getting a new motor after 111,000 miles  I loved the car since the day I bought it. Fun to drive and peppy.  If you are a tall person (maybe over 5'8"") then I would not recommend as it is shaped like a race car without a lot of head room.  I am 5'3"" so it was perfect.  NEVER a days trouble out of it.  UNITIL one morning I cranked it, let it warm up, and pulling out of my driving it just suddenly stopped. After cranking it back it had developed disease that sounded like a hammer beating a metal bucket.  Towed it to the dealership and sure enough, the engine recall affected my car.  Im getting a new engine.  I plan on keeping the car...see what happens."
Didn't purchase. Leased.  
turbo fan  have loved this car over the 4 years I have been driving it- great acceleration and great electronicsit has been very reliable for me
"Nice looking car for decent $  Needed affordability and hopefully 
reliability for as little money as 
possible, while still having something 
attractive and fun to drive.  The car 
looks great and is indeed fun to 
drive, and I got a killer deal! Could 
have probably gotten more features on 
a Mazda3 or even a Chevy Cavalier for 
the same money, but will certainly 
enjoy driving and owning a Mustang 
much more than either of those cars."
Nice looking inside & out  The battery didn't last too long & the wheel alignment was easily knocked out so had to replace tires too early.
"85K miles on my 2012 Sonata SE  I've been very pleased with this car!  Bought it new and have had it 3 1/2 years now. I put a lot of miles on my vehicles (avg 22K - 24K per year) however I take very good care of them, following manufacturer's suggested maintenance schedule, getting regular oil changes, tire rotation, etc. I typically keep cars for 150K miles at a minimum.  I average appx 28 MPG in Atlanta traffic (which is stop and go).  No complaints whatsoever.  Convinced my Dad and stepmom to buy a Sonata and they love theirs as well!"
"Who wants a Sonata that needs a new engine??  Our 2012 Sonata with regular maintenance records experienced a sudden catastrophic engine failure at 74,000 miles.  No warning lights have ever come on in the car but it suddenly began to lose power and make a terrible noise. Since it was still under warranty, we had it towed to our dealer who told us that the engine had to be replaced and it was covered and the engine would be replaced within a few days.  Subsequently, Hyundai changed their mind and chose not to honor their warranty stating ""customer neglect"".  We provided all our service records showing oil changes basically every 4 months but they still said it was our fault.  We have since found out that this is happening all over the country to cars with the 2.4 liter Theta II GDI engine.   Edmonds should research this because this is a widespread problem.  I would not buy another Hyundai because they do not honor their warranty.Update:  After the NTSB got involved, Hyundai recalled all these engines and mine was finally replaced 4 months after it failed.  I received some of the money back that this failure cost me but was not reimbursed for the time I couldn't use my car and had to still insure it and drive a car with a lot less fuel mileage."
"Mileage champ  Car has GDI engine, I bought new, now have 56k miles. Outstanding gas mileage. Best highway mileage was with just me in the car, barely any luggage and a fall day, keeping it on flat ground thru the Midwest for 400 miles at between 65 and 70 mph I got 41 mpg, and this was dividing number of gallons by miles driven. Computer is always optimistic - usually 2 mpg higher than what it really is when checking the math. Car gets around 26-27 mpg city, with the family in the car and going 70 on the freeway expect 36-38 mpg.Decent power with the 2.4 engine. I run full synthetic oil all the time and BG fuel and oil cleaners regularly. Standard radio is the only downfall. It is weak. Road noise is also a minor irritation. Comfort of a/c and heater are good. Absolutely no mechical issues to date. Battery lasted 3 year, Hankook tires were replaced after 55k miles, - they could have gone 60k though but we're getting real noisy.Replaced tires with contenitial dws06 tires. They are about the same as the original hankooks which I think we're real good tires.Car goes good in the snow, but as tires wear you loose traction on incline and experience spin. Car handle real well in the wet weather. Lots of room and cargo space for family of 4. Well put together car, but depreciates quickly. Get a used one as there is no difference between the 2011 thru 2014."
"2012 Sonata Limited Turbo with Nav (Excellent Value)  I bought this car used about six months ago, and I must say it feels and drives like a much more expensive car then the one I paid for. I have owned BMWs, Nissans and Toyotas in the past and I feel this is a better car. The turbo 4 cylinder engine really does feel like a V6, I have a V6 Toyota Venza and I know what I am talking about. This thing Just takes off without any fuss, granted the engine only had 16K miles when I bought this car. Anyone planning on buying turbo model,  keep in mind, this car requires 91 octane or higher, and synthetic oil changes, which is little more mony, but it will keep your car working for years to come.
This is my 1st hyundai product and it gets 5 from me. "
"Very disappointing!  I bought the Sonata for its snazzy looks, technology and the promise of good gas mileage.  Other than its looks, it's been a disappointment.  The ride is bad - I feel every bump in the road.  The gas mileage is not what was promised.  I'm only getting an average of 22-23 mpg. overall.  And, its performance in snow was so poor the first winter I had it that I ditched all 4 tires and bought new ones with the promise of improvement. The 2nd year wasn't much better.  Granted, there was alot of snow in Rhode Island this year, but - hey - it performed way worse than my old 1999 Camry in snow! Uncharacteristically, I will probably be unloading it way sooner than usual or as planned."
"My story  I have had my Sonata for almost four years now, with a little over 33,000 mileage.   After 8 months of having it, I needed a new transmission.  Now I need a new engine.  I feel like I ended up with a lemon.   No one wants to hear it and service tries to shift the blame to me some how.   I have all my invoices of oil changes, brakes, etc.   So I have done my part.
I loved my car.   When you buy something new you want the new engine, the new transmission and so on.  You are paying for that.  As in anything there can be a circumstance where this vehicle was not assembled correctly.  But no one will own up to it.  I dread thinking of what will be next."
"Great Car with Some Flaws  With almost 63,000 miles, I'm really very happy overall with the car. The only real issues are: 1) A problem with the cloth upholstery. It started to show signs of wear only a few months after purchase. It now looks like a 20 year old car seat. The dealer took photos and sent them on to Hyundai to see what they can do. 2) Since day one, the highway stability has been a little sketchy. It's ok until you are around other vehicles when the wind buffeting can move the car around. I'm used to it now but at first it was unsettling. 3) The fuel pump went bad at 62,000 miles which I thought was premature. But the dealer took care of it under warranty, no problem.Update: After 110,000 miles I still love this car! It just goes with little to no maintenance. Though I'm starting to hear a clicking noise up front while turning which may be a CV joint. But I'll have the dealer look at it. Other than that, the car is near perfect and I plan on keeping it until the wheels fall off!"
"Bad Oil Pump - Very Poor Service!  Per the Hyundai dealer in Dalton, GA the reason for our oil pressure light on was a bad oil pump that scored the main bearings on the crankshaft.  The process to get to replacing the engine was a 2 out of 10 on the service meter!  Between the dealer, Hyundai USA, and the 3rd party warranty company, Fidelity, I am extremely disappointed.  
 The ownership level by Hyundai was very poor.  They passed the process of correcting the issue to Fidelity who was a 1 out 10 on the service level!
 It is disappointing that a car that I like with a significant quality issue was handled the way it was.
 This is my first and last Hyundai.  Nissan, Toyota, Honda - here I come!"
"Solid mid-size contender for commuting  If you want to buy a good car for daily commuting, you cant do much better than this Sonata.  Reliable, fuel efficient and pretty cheap to operate makes this an easy choice.  We bought this car new in 2012 and currently have just over 62000 miles on it.  This is the base GLS with only 3 options - most if not all of the important features you need are standard.  I'd recommend this Sonata to anyone needing a good, reliable, commuter car.  Build quality is excellent and has been a very reliable, inexpensive car to operate.  Only one warranty repair has been needed in 62000 miles and that was for a faulty cruise control switch which was repaired under warranty. "
"Not what I thought  I have been wanting a Mustang since 
1986. Finally I could afford one. The 
acceleration and handling are okay. 
The styling and and sound of the 
exhaust are awesome, but...the car has 
been back to the dealer 4 times in 
three months with engine problems. All 
is supposedly fixed, but no so. 
Unfortunately, this was a case of of 
fantasy being much better than 
reality. Back to a Honda I guess. "
"Warning - Burns oil. Destroyed engine.  I bought a 2012 Sonota to replace  another. It had regular 3000 mile oil changes. I bought it to NTB for the last one in June of 2014.The sticker said to get oil changed at 58,000 He said it would be fine at 62000.No problems. I heard some  knocking  at 63000 so I had it towed in, I have a warrahty so I did not want to risk it, No oil light . No burning, No indication of oil issue, I thought it was a belt. I take i They told me it had burned through  almost 4 quarts of oil and it killed the engine. Mild weather Light driving, Reasonable oil changes a little past oil change date and this? The extended $1000 warranty won't cover it . They want $5000 to put new engine.  Beware UPDATE 4/20/2016. Hyundai did a recall on my 2012 sonota. They said the oil chamber had a coating that came loose over time and sent shards of the coating through the engine.This caused the engine to burn oil internally and the engine would lock up with no oil. Not the consumers fault. I allready replaced the engine with the cheapest one I could find at my own cost 4600.00. I also was forced to pay for the engine diagnosis 650.00  They refused warranty coverage because they said it was my fault. I only changed the oil every 4000 to 4700 miles. They couldn't see why it lost oil but they wouldn't cover it under my 2 warranties. The recall has since happened. This engine I bought is also losing oil quickly. Emptied 4 and 1/2 quarts in 3200 miles? Weird. I am taking it in tomorrow to hopefully get engine replaced with a better one and get a refund for my costs. I wish the service department and car dealership manager had treated me better through this ordeal . They tried to make me believe it was my fault. I said I took good care of my car and it was a defect. I was right. They were rude and wrong. Hoping to get a refund, a decent engine and an apology. Getting a Honda next time because of the customer service. Update. Hyundai put another engine in at my cost.5000. There is a vlass action lawsuit and a recall  in place. They do believe me know. I should get my 5000 back. Should get more for the outrageously poor service and nit living up to warranty. The engine replacement is also failing and stalling like the first. Will need to be replaced. Worst new car Ive ever bought. Customer service at luther bloomington hyundai is historically. Bad.FAST FORWARD May 2017. The hyundai engine they replaced the first with also burned oil internally and blew the engine. I bought it in for oil changes every 3000 miles. Burnsville Hyundai knew it was not my band fault as they were keeping a close eye on the car and measuring oil consumption and quality. They are going to replace the engine beacuse it blew at 100500 miles and they extended the warranty to 120000 miles because of the recall."
"Engine failed 72K, no help from Hyundai  The lower end of my 2.4 L Sonata failed at 72500 miles under normal driving conditiuons.  It has had an oil change every 5000 miles.  Because I am not the original owner, the warranty did not apply.  The dealer was very nice and sold me a used engine at full price.  Hyundai USA declined to help me in any way.
 No care should have this type of engine failure at this mileage unless completely neglected.  "
"Good Experience  60K miles in and no major problems so far with my Sonata. Overall it has been a reliable car and plenty fun to drive. I have had no mechanical issues whatsoever. The only items I have had to replace are the pads and rotors (at 60k), everything else is doing just fine."
"love / hate relationship  My first non honda product in many years. Love the features, performance, mileage and style. What i hate are the problems, waste gate issue after 1000 miles, spider webs in the turbo, waste gate reprogram again and finally at 50k the engine light on again and a fuel pump replacement. While all were under warranty there were no loaner cars offered by my dealer. Its like my Corvette, great car when its running right ! I finally traded this car in last year after 72k miles because it just did not age well. The car felt very loose and and developed suspension issues in the front end and a recall for an issue with the rear suspension. I guess I was a spoiled Honda owner who was not accustomed to repeat visits to the shop for repairs, covered or not. Yes, I have returned to Honda, new CRV, which has never been back to dealer for any issues in the past year."
"2012 Limited 2.0T  All in all I must say I'm impressed with my Sonata. I've had one issue thus far, problem with the waste gate being out of spec. Evidently there is a Technical Bulletin out regarding it. I have the black on grey leather. Very appealing look, plenty of power, and on long rides it can average 35-38 mpg on the highway. I run 5w40 Amsoil and premium gas. "
"Over 2 years with Sonata 2012 Limited 2.4L with navigation, Hankook-Tire H431 215/55/17  V - 28,000 miles  I might be wrong / you have different situation but I'd like to help someone who are suffering from the issues as the same as mine.1. Creaking noise from rear suspension- fixed by dealer2. Pulling issue & tire noise at high speed - dealer's answer : no problem- My solution : Adjust wheel alignment & Changed tires to Michelin MXV4 94H(94V recommend) - It works great.3. Hands free button malfunction(sometimes)- replaced by dealer4. Cruise control ""SET""/""Cancel"" malfunction (50% failure)- dealer's answer : no problem - waiting for 100% failure.5. Weird noise from engine.- Using Octane 91 / 93 Gas.Now I'm feeling more comfortable after spending money & time."
Great car. Great Value  great car. i choose the hyundai after driving the 12 altima and 12 accord. Hands down winner.
"My Sweet New Ride!  I purchased my SE CPO w/ 9400 miles, Nav/Sunroof package, wind deflector, spoiler & full leather. It has the silver /blue pearl paint w/ black interior. The car looks amazing! Rides great, love how it handles. I've had it one month and have driven nearly 2000 miles already and haven't had any issues at all. The car came with this Blue Link thing that let's me remotely control the car(start/doors/lights/horn), gives monthly diagnostic reports and can even slow the car down to a complete stop if I reported stolen and then the GPS will tell me where it is. Cool or what.Since it's CPO I get the 5yr/60k full warranty, the 10yr/100k power-train warranty and 10yr/unlimited roadside assistance :)"
"No Such Thing As A Perfect Vehicle, But ...  ... this one really comes close.My preference is mid-sized cars with high-end trim levels ... Camry XLE, Accord EX-L, etc.This is my first Sonata Limited, but not my last.It compares very favorably with its Nissan, Toyota and Honda counterparts ... they're all great vehicles, and given that I don't buy new cars, availability is limited. This one is exactly what I'd have purchased new ... and with only 11k miles (and at $10k less), it's close enough!The ride is smooth, power (both cruising and takeoff) is more than adequate, gas mileage (overall about 26 mpg) is fine, and the creature comforts far exceed the competition. Hyundai is now a major player in the mid-size market! "
"Overall  We all have our opinions of our own Sonata's, for myself even after an accident, which I had Hyundai fix completely because I wanted no issues and it was major damage.I have no problems at all in a yr and one month of owning the car.My own issue and an issue, major for some and minor for many is the map update for the Nav. system.They completely lied or didn't know that you had to pay 200 plus dollars each year IF you wanted the update.Many people don't care/have bigger issues with the car or do pony up.To me it's the principal.[non-permissible content removed]."
"Ford?  Never Again!  My wife wanted this pretty red 
Mustang.  We needed a car that gets 
good gas mileage, and after seeing on 
the ""sticker"" that the V-6 was 
estimated to get 19 city/26 highway, we 
felt as though this was a good purchase 
for us.  Well, it gets 11 mpg in town.  
The dealer did troubleshooting on the 
car, and informed me that it was 
getting 15 mpg in town, and 25 on the 
highway.  So, the Ford Factory Rep 
suggested that he fill the tank, drive 
it for 20 miles or so, then refill the 
tank and determine the mileage.  He got 
almost 12 miles to the gallon!  Thus 
far, Ford Motor Company refuses to do 
anything else.  "
"My first hyundai  The car is excellent for the value.Hyundai put a lot into this car regarding quality.I purchased the car new with all maintenance included.I have owned the car for 1 year so far.No issues.Important:You have to do the maintenance on this car or it will not drive like it is supposed to. Also, the car has a GDI engine.Please read up on the engine.I bought a turbo because the engine runs better with it.I have seen mileage fluctuations but it was related to gas and oil.You have to put premium in once a month.Chevron with Techron is best.It does require injector cleaner once every 2 months to keep up the MPG.Buy the maintenance with the car!!!!!!!!Update: 4/2016I still have the car.  Still love it.  Kept the one I have (Orig $27K) because a new one is $35K with less horsepower.Had the A/C compressor replaced under warranty.  Other than that, no issues.  Still get great MPG and performance.I am at 75K miles.  Have to replace the oil at 3K-4K miles as the car burns the oil.  No matter what type you put in.  Iput royal purple from walmart.  The car does require more maintenance that other cars, like my wife's honda accord.I have to change the coolant, transmission,brake, and oil fluids more often.. . . twice as often in fact.  But it runs.  I donot like the fact that you have to pay to update the navigation.  Mine is a 2012 2.0T with~300hp.  another update to come ina year or so.Update: 5/2018The car still runs great.  Walmart does the oil changes and rotates the tires.  I have 112K miles at this point.  I switched to a set of 4 New Vercelli Strada Ii - P225/45zr18 and they are great.   I had a set on sentry tires but they only lasted a year and a half."
2012 Hyundai Sonata Battery Problems  Car is a good value over all but I've had several issues with the battery going dead. Hyundai has replaced it twice since I bought it. They do not seem to understand why its constantly going dead perhaps it Henderson Hyundai service not looking to closely. Not sure why myself but it is frustrating to go for the weekend on a trip and come home to a dead battery.On board bluetooth sound is horrible and I quit using it all togetherBluelink needs better navigation tools. Doesn't seem to provide accurate addresses even after speaking it several times.
"Huge dissapointment!  There are much more negative than postitive in my 1.5 years of Sonata ownership. First is the fuel economy, nowhere even close to Hyundai's estimates. Now after getting over that the problems began. It had a poor running and stalling out problem several times the dealer can't duplicate, the front headlights have collected condensation and I'm on my second set. The leather quality is horrible, stiching on the bolsters is coming apart already (hyundai calls it normal wear) It wanders on the highway. I've had the struts, tires, wheel bearings, and control arm bushings replaced...still wanders! The car has just been such a huge dissapointment, it feels like a 5 yr old car already."
"Nicest used car I've purchased..  I've only had my 2012 sonata for a few wks now, I purchased it used with 5k miles on it. For being used it isn't too bad, brakes are already bad, had to replace cabin air filter and the mpg they advertise is a lie, but its still better than my suv.The alternative starter in the middle console also don't work, so I'm taking it in next week for that. I also agree on Hyundai customer service, it's horrible, they don't care about their customers and they constantly lie. So with that said take your factory warranty and go elsewhere to get service done to it. Yes they will tell you you can't, but you can. I get mine serviced at A ford dealership where they listen and actually fix your car!"
"Hyundai Service and Warranty  Please be advised that Hyundai has come a long way from the junk they originally sold. I have had problems with the window washer clogging which the dealer told me was my fault and I would have to pay $100.00 to fix it?Secondly, my radiator blew up on my way home from work with 20000 miles on the car. I was advised by Kendall Hyundai that a rock (they think-because they were not sure where it was leaking from) flew up and damaged the radiator; therefore it was the drivers fault?I took it to an independent certified mechanic who advised me there was NO physical damage and that the radiator was DEFECTIVE.Instead of the dealer cost of $800 I ended up paying $475, a true travesty."
"NOT SO GREAT AFTER ALL  Wanted to buy a mid-sized sedan with good gas mileage. Considered an altima but the interior was much better on the sonata. After hearing about the 10 year 100k warranty and the 35mpg rating I had to have it. The panorama roof, 200hp, and 35mpg were the three main reasons for me buying the car. After one year and 16k miles I am very dissapointed with the quality, performance and gas mileage. The car has had several electrical bugs and the engine sounds horrible. It really doesnt seem to have the 200hp hyundai says it has. I struggle to keep mympg above 26 mpg going about 65-70mph on the highway with eco mode on. This car is not as good as I thoght it was. Dont fall for hyundai's mpg lies!"
"Thought it was a good buy... think again.  I thought I was getting a great deal on my 2012 Hyundai Sonata 2.0T Limited that I purchased in late November. During the past few months the car has had numerous problems, complete lemon. Has issues accelerating, leaks when it rains, gauges randomly shut off while I am driving, and it pulls to the left so horribly by arm begins to hurt after my 20 minute drive to work. I've brought it to Hyundai regarding the issues, and they fixed none of them. Blamed me for them all. Horrible customer service. I will never buy a Hyundai product again."
"Waited to review 'til I'd driven a whole year...  The Sonata is a VERY cool ride.I stumbled upon a red 2011 SE Sedan in May, 2010... only to find out shortly after that the Turbo model was available. I wanted it immediately.The first time I saw one, I test-drove it and knew it was 'love'... but didn't buy because I wanted it (again!) in red.Didn't want a dealer to find one, order one, etc.; I resigned to keep my original purchase.But, in November, 2011, during a routine maintenance visit, it just so happened that a 2012 red Turbo was on the sales floor.Bought it the same visit... no test drive, even.Have never looked back (pun intended!) and still love it!Sporty clean lines, liquid handling, and the torque is just plain fun!!!"
sonata  good purchase
"Satisfied whit my sonta   As previous owner of a Dodge Durango I have to said the Sonata is the best. I walk in to I Love Lee Hyunday of Fayett and Ms Quiomara take good care of me.I love this car, and my family and friens fall in love whit it."
Used Car Alternative  I bought a brand new 04 V6 5 speed 
Disappointed  I should have driven the actual car I bought before completing the deal. The steering has no road feel to it. Steering is dead. It tends to pull to the left. It is hard to keep the car straight in the lane. The car tends to wander.The turbo makes funny noises when I start the car.It has lots of HP but it doesn't feel like it until near the top of the shift point. I did not get anywhere near the milage claimed. I got about 26 mpg hwy and 19 city.Interior materials are ok but does feel like a cheap car that it is. 
"Problems with no help from dealer or the manufacturer  The car pulls to the left. The rear brakes went at18,000 miles. They blamed me for not having the sliders lubricated but I too the cAR FOR SERVICE TO THE DEALER SINCE i BOUGHT. wHY DID'NT THEY TELL ME. THEY DIDN'T. A CALL TO HYUNDAI MOTORS RESOLVED NOTHING.I DON'T ENJOY THE CAR.When you trade it in you will get nothing compared to Honda and Toyota.Some dealers are sellingfor $3,500 above sticker price. There is no reason for this. Don't pay it. Go on the internet and find a price there, but I would not recommend this car. Honda, Toyota and Nissan mask much better cars and have better service and trade in.Why by a sonata?"
"Ooops ...  This model of Sonata is miserable failure. I do not know from where to start. Before I purchased it, I drove it three times just to make sure it does not have that pull to the left issue. Unfortunately, after 10k miles I have front tires uneven wear. Dealer states that nothing is wrong with tires although even 1st grader would see difference between even and uneven tire wear. Contacted Hyundai and they refused any responsibility. Rest assured - they will make sure you don't get solution to tire (?) problem. I did not notice it before but steering wheel is not placed centered to the driver's seat. It is at about 1 inch offset to the left. Radiator leaked at 10k miles. Fixed under warranty."
"Great Car for the Money  I have about 8500 miles on my Sonata and I am very happy with it so far. My previous car was a 2007 Infiniti G35X Sedan, so I was expecting a somewhat mundane driving experience, but happily, I was wrong. It's definitely no Infiniti, but a great car nonetheless.The fuel mileage is as advertised. It runs great and has an amazing amount of power for a four cylinder. It has a very comfortable interior/driving position for me and I am very fussy about that.I especially like the light steering, bluetooth, Homelink, satellite radio, comfy seats and the intuitive and easy to understand controls.It is simply a lot of car for a relatively small price."
"Looks great, but...  Bold lines.Great styling. This car will catch your eye, and hold it. Great value, and a great size. But all is not how its seems.Listed as a full size sedan, however... its not. Seems better suited as a mid-size.The 2.4 l four cylinder is great for saving gas, but forgets that its supposed to make the car move at times.Its got a better rear end than a Mustang GT... more modern anyway.But warning... the ride is rough as an old woodie rollercoaster!How nice would this be if the rear wheels pushed instead of dragged the car down!Still, this car is better than what you will find in most places (cough cough, chevy cruze, cough cough)..."
"Not happy  I bought my 2012 sonata SE new in January 2012.About 2 weeks ago my car stopped working properly and they initially thought it was the push start ignition.Replaced the push start and the problem still persisted.They then removed the oil pan to discover pieces of metal in the oil.Long story short the engine needs to be replaced and the car has 16,500 miles on it.I am not happy with the overall experience and being without a car that I need for my daily commute.No car should have to have the engine replaced after being driven for only 7 months."
"Warning: Test-driving this vehicle will compell you to purchase it  Please, do not test-drive a Sonata Turbo unless you're you're ready to buy, because you're gonna be compelled to buy it. The engineers of the 2.0 turbo Sonata are geniuses. The GDI was already cutting-edge for the regular 2.4 4-cyl, but the performance and fuel efficiency of the 274hp turbo are just pure genius. Simply put, it's a rocket. I effortlessly pass pretty much any car I want, anywhere, at any time, yet I get consistent 30-35mpg on the highway WITHOUT the ECO on and enthusiastic driving. Even the 'softer' limited suspension handles tight corners with great agility (18"" low-profile tires help too). Beautiful engineering. And oh yeah, did I mention it's beautiful to stare at as well?"
"Good, Solid, Fun  I have 20,000 miles on my new Sonata. It's been a great car to drive so far with no major issues. I've obtained fantastic gas mileage (37mpg) by combining the ECO mode, cruise control and a nice long highway. The paint is sexy and durable. The fit / finish is solid without any noticeable defects. I've been completely satisfied with my service crew as well."
"A lemon like none other.  I have just over 22,000 miles on my '12 Sonata Turbo. This car has been in the shop for many Different problems since I bought it. Hyundai service is terrible, the company just does not care about the owners of their cars. My Sonata has a stalling problem that has plagued it for 6 months now, it just quits, could be on the interstate, at an intersection, a red light, no rhyme nor reason. Its very dangerous to have this happen so often, Hyundai has not been able to fix this issue. I've also had issues with the A/C, nav/audio unit, headliner, antifreeze smell through the dash vents, abs brake sensor, and several rattles and other poor quality car noises."
"All in all very nice car for $$  I have owned a Lexus, Acura and Volvo. This car compares to the Japanese luxury brands as far as the drive. It is very smooth feeling and saves gas. Great price!!! It doesn't drive like the Volvo did in its good days. I really only missing my sunroof. I upgraded to leather and alloy wheels. You should too the cloth seats are cheapish and kinda hard to me. The ride is very loud and rough with steeThe passenger side seat is kinda low to the ground. The gadgets on the car are nice. Everything wraps around the driver which is NICE and luxurious. The backseat and trunk are very spacious! Way more exciting than the Honda Accord or Altima- BORING. I do like this car only time will tell if it lasts"
"Great Stang  Great car, dollar for dollar the most gratifying car I've owned. After coming off a slug slow but reliable BMW this is a very fun exciting ride. Wife's Audi which left our world last month feeling like a recovering crack addict, put her in the new 2009 flex. Average mileage 60% city 40% freeway/speedway southern california avg hghwy speed 80 mph overall mileage 21 on the Mustang v-8 quite impressive. Can't say enough about this car plan to hit 300k before retirement then it will still be worth a rebuild for weekend duties and fun."

"Disappointed owner  Sonata drives OK but the interior looks and feels cheap. My major problem with Hyundai is its customer service. 3 days ago I decided to go shopping. I left my car in the parking lot. When I returned, I found a major fracture in the windshield (20 ""). I drove to Hyundai dealer. Their service guy looked at it, couldn't find any chips, so he took a pencil and traced the fracture and concluded that it was caused by a stone hitting the windshield. I told him that it happened in the parking lot but he wouldn't believe me. Right, I'm trying to rip Hyundai off for $200. They don't have any trust in their customer. So much for Hyundai for me. As soon as I pay it off, I'll trade it in for a Camry."
Don't buy this car.  I owned 2012 Sonata Limited and 7500 mileage. You will get feeling so bad and get tired because of wandering while drive. (especially on Highway)The poor steering won't be centered as much as 1/2 inches.(left and right)Dealer and Customer center seemed like they have no solution about this so far.I'd like you to go with Honda accord.I'm waiting for my payoff day.
"Nice car!  Was in the market for a fuel economical car and saw this little beauty sitting at the Chevy dealer. Traded in my 1996 gas guzzler Suburban for it. Wasn't sure about the brand Hyundai at first...so far I'm impressed. The car is really sporty for a sedan and just has this clean & crisp feeling to it. It has plenty of gadgets to play with: blue-tooth, blue-link,radio with USB stick plugin, LCD display, etc.The automatic shifting in this car is a little weird but I think that's because it's a 4 banger and it tries to keep you in lower gears so you have power. As for the power this thing GETS UP AND GOES! I thought getting on the highway was going to be a joke...I easily zoom past others!"
"Made The Switch!  Coming from a 2010 Nissan Altima SL 2.5, I needed to get out of my lease (I just got a new job that requires a 35 minute commute each way).I researched Honda Accord, Ford Fusion, Toyota Camry, Subaru Legacy, Honda Civic and the Hyundai Elantra.To me, it wasn't a tough decision.I opted for the GLS base trim and although I missed out on power seats, chrome interior handles and alloys in the GLS Option #2 package, it boiled down to what was important to me.The base still has bluetooth and XM (my Altima SL didn't have them both), and the performance is the same on all trims.The car drives well also - fluid steering, nice acceleration and great MPG. "
Low MPG  Disappointing gas mileage.Divide mileage by gallons and find it's only getting about 24mpg for mixed city/hwy. That's with the eco mode on and gentle driving.Not what I was led to believe. Steering is a little twitchy on the freeway. Seats are a little firm.Other than that it's a nice car.So far no problems.
"Bad MPG  bought mine about 2 months ago. MPG as advertised is not!! advertised 24/35 and on hwy i get 29 and in town I get 18. when I took to dealer ship to have looked at, service department told me that everyone he knows does get 29 hwy. the digital readout may say 34 but when you divide the miles driven by gallons put in, it doesn't match the readout. Anyone can make a computer readout say anything they want to. I would not buy this car again due only to the false advertisement on the sticker on the MPG. The fine fine fine print on sticker says the average person will get 28-39. Can you say WOW what a difference in range. And car has alot of road noise. "
"Having so much fun!  I originally thought I'd get another SUV after driving a Grand Cherokee for many years. I liked the looks of the Hyundai Genesis and Azera on the highway and went to the dealer to look at those, but was blown away by the styling, features, and quality of the Sonata for much less money.Chose the Limited Turbo with sports suspension for the handling; the steering on the regular Limited was too busy for me after having also driven a BMW for a while, but the SE handles better. My big complaint right now is that the gas mileage is too far off from the sticker for me. So far I am getting about 23 combined and a max of 29 highway on a 300-highway-mile trip (dinged one performance star for that)."
Great Car definitely the best in it's class right now  I did a lot of research before choosing this car. This I believe is the best in it's class right now. i am sure other manufacturers will catch up in the fall but for now Sonata is on top. I got a Limited with Navigation.I have owned the car for a month and haven't had anything I don't like. The limited packs a lot of features that you see in luxury brands. I cannot think of any feature
"2012 Sonata Limited w/ Navigation  Just bought my new 2012 Sonata Limited and it's the greatest car I have ever purchased.I am particularly thrilled with the interior and luxury items like electric seat positions with lumbar support, reverse image on screen to help with backing up, and overall look.While not a Turbo, I still feel the acceleration and handling is excellent."
"Good value for the price  This car has surpassed my expectations. The acceleration and power with the 2.0 turbo feels like I have a six cylinder under the hood. The SE package gives a good feel for the road and handles very good. Yes, you are going to feel more of the bumps, but that is what you get for the handling package. The price for what you get is a value."

"Death Trap  I leased 2 weeks ago a brand new 2012 Sonata.It has a swerving problem.The car is all over the road.I am scared to drive it.Of course it has been back into the dealership 2 times and they are telling me nothing is wrong.Hyundai refuses to admit they have another steering problem.They will not take back the car.I am afraid for my life, and they won't do the right thing.DO NOT buy this car or anything by Hyundai as they won't help you even when their cars have know DEFECTS. Rating--0"
"holy moly!  I am a ""Ford for life kind of guy.""I did some research and found a vehicle by the name of ""Hyundai""I remember growing up, thinking ""Hyundai was a piece of crap.""But, I just bought a 2012 Sonata Limited for my wife.Now i think, ""Holy Crap.""What a vehicle!If you think Honda and Toyota are the best in the west, well you got to test drive this thing.I was so Impressed! "
"Awesome Car!  The 2012 Sonata is amazing!I have had 3 Toyota Camrys in the past and intended to buy another.However, I decided to compare vehicles, so I test drove the Camry and the Honda Accord as well.The Sonata was definitely the best pick!I love the styling (inside & out), the ride is quiet and comfortable (and it's just plain fun to drive), interior room is incredible, the warranty is great and the gas mileage is awesome (averaging 34.9 MPG).I also like the Bluetooth and the new Blue Link feature.It's not only a great safety feature, but it gives you alot of other perks.Highly recommend this vehicle!!"
"i would definently buy again  i work out of my car and spend alot of time in it. 40k,yrthat being said, i am 6 1, 230 lbs, and this has alot more room than any other car in its class.seriously.i looked at accord and camry, but if you spend 2 minutes in this car you will LOVE IT.again tons of room, a slap shift when you want power.it get 30 mpg at the pump.ive gotten 39mpg on a long road trip. the engine is quiet, it is very comfortable, it doesn't look like a grandma mobile, i carry 3 duffel bags of medical supplies in the trunk with room to spare. and it has a 5 star crash rating.its alot cheaper then its copetition.but, you will notice a difference in build quality.nothing substancial though"
Excellent Value for the Price  We had a 2004 Sonata and the only problem I had with it was a battery during the 7 years that we owned it.Naturally when the 2011 was introduced we went to check it out and were impressed.I took my wife's advice and purchased all of the options which included the navigation package.The 4-cylinder engine on this car accelerates much better than the 6-cylinder Sonata we had before.The keyless ignition is great. The ability to open the doors without a key is very convenient so that you don't have to go searching for keys in your pockets or purse.I have read a very few negative customer reviews on the Sonata but overall most people are pleased with this car.It performs well overall.
"Always owned jeep or dodge, but wow  Very good gas mileage, we average just over 32 on freeways and just over 27 combined.  Lots of pep, never thought a four banger could have this much go power.  Front seat are comfy and driver headroom is great.  I am just over 6'3"" and I fit.  Back seats while comfy have less headroom.  It has very good lane keeping for the most part.  I was able to go over 10 miles on a curvy highway without touch the steering wheel.  It will lose track though on entrance/exit points and badly painted roads.  For the most part it kept me near center of the lane without pingponging.  Controls for the most part are logical and clear.  Mapping is good but it took a little while to adjust to it.  Pricing is very good if you are willing to call and insist on a final cost before arriving at the dealership.  I got this for $30k out the door.  Paint is normal, tires are good and pretty quiet but we will upgrade when needed.  The only problems so far are the headlights leave an indent in the center, and there is a slight distortion in the glass in top center.  You have to be tall to see it.  Overall a great purchase, compared to the $50k luxury cars I was looking at."
"Awesome Value!  Got A Lot For My Cash  Purchased this car two years ago to replace a new 2016 Civic, that I found to be too small, with seats that didn't support well and uncomfortable on very long drives.  If you have ever owned a Camry, this is the Korean version of one.  The less exciting things are. 1) The 2.4L engine is rather tepid, if you think you are going to make burn-out marks on the street, you will be wrong.  It kind of eases into highway traffic and you have to stomp on it (it will scream at you when you do), to get some good merging on a very busy and loaded highway.  However, for regular surface streets, it accelerates well enough.  Handling also is kind of on the sloppy side, so if you whip it around a corner at high speed, don't be surprised if it tries to whip you back.  In other words, it gets a little bit floaty and may not go exactly where you point it.  It will eventually settle down.  Tire grip is okay, but the Kumho tires on it are not as quiet as some BF Goodrich's that I've used on other cars.  They will be replaced by Pirelli's or BF Goodrich's.  So, you wonder why I purchased it?  I knew about the handling and tracking because I've rented this vehicle several times.   The first reason is fuel economy.  This car when driven continuously on the highway at around 70mph, gets about average 34 to 36 miles per gallon.  Even in mix traffic, I very seldom get less than 32 mpg.  In a 250 mile drive recently, where I had it cruising at 65mph, the car achieved, 39.75 miles per gallon.  For a car that can easily handle four adult passengers, or 5 passengers with kids in the back, that is phenomenal.   It is a very quiet cruiser, on very long drives there is not a lot of noise intrusion, which can increase driver fatigue.   The entertainment system is very simple to use, with large fonts and nice size push buttons for phone, media, radio, blue-tooth and the like.  It also works very well with my Android phones.  The visibility behind the steering wheel is excellent to the front, sides and the rear.  The trunk is very large and you can throw a lot of stuff into it.  Also, the layout inside is simple and the quality of the materials is decent.   Most important was the price.  Getting the Sports model with twin exhausts (that make it look sporty, even though it is not), LED daytime running lights, the darker chrome in the front and then putting dark, tinted windows on it.  Well, it looks like a design that although a little bit boring, well still look good in 6 years.    At just over $21K, none of the other mid-size (large mid-size) cars could match it for the equipment and features  One more thing, I have had no real issues with this vehicle at all and I'm at 39,000 miles.  The entertainment system went weird after two months of purchase.  Hyundai ordered me a radio, received it and installed it in about a week.  It still has another 20,000 on the bumper to bumper warranty and more than a 100,000 on the powertrain."
"Value Style and Comfort - What a Trifecta!!  I test drove a 2015 Sonata when my girlfriend at the time was looking at cars and fell in love with the car - so when my car died in late 2017, I bought my 2016 Hyundai Sonata SE PZEV. It was a rental car, so it has 48,000 miles, but looks new, feels new, and drives like new! I paid $12,900 for the car, and haven't given it a second thought - I get over 40MPG on flat highway at 59mph in the Eco mode, and when I want to kick it up a for sport driving, the Sport mode gives me incredible performance, and 38mpg - cant beat it! 7in touch screen with Apple Car play or Android Connect works flawlessly. I am hooked.**Update 4/13/18 - After owning the car for 6 months, a few things are worth noting. The car gets great mileage on the road, 38-44mpg, but town driving has been at 23mpg - of course I drive aggressive. The car handles very good, and continues to be very comfortable. I would buy it again. Now have 55k on the clock."
"After One Month of Use  I'm impressed with the vehicle. I am an Uber driver, and it handles all the situations very well. There are a few problems. The first one is you cannot charge your cell phone or use accessories if the vehicle is turned off. I find it very annoying when I want to charge my phone. Another problem is the steering wheel obstructs the visibility of the gas gauge. I ran out of gas yesterday and it almost happened several times. another issue is once you conne t your phone to the android system there isn't any way to delete the information or the app. if i don't turn off bluetooth on my phone all my calls are on the car system"
"I would drive 2000 miles, I would drive 2000 more!  I was packing up the family and heading to New York/New Jersey for vacation. I decided to rent a car, since both of my cars are older. I was given a base model in blue, a very stunning blue too! Let me get the bad things out of the way, because they are minor. While the seats are comfortable, the center stack infringes into the driver space right where my knee would like to go. The car has great cruise control, and lights in the instrument cluster to tell you when it is on and when it is set. The car also has a great information screen in the middle of that cluster. While that screen shows changes for wiper speed, wiper intermittent speed, gear selection, and probably a couple other things I'm missing, it doesn't tell you what speed you set the cruise to. It seems like this would be easy, so I thought it odd that it didn't. And what is it with cars and the high setting on the HVAC fan? A car this quiet should not have a fan this loud.  Otherwise the car was great for the almost 2000 miles we drove it. It was quiet, the ride was smooth, road noise was minimal even when the fan was not on high. The stereo system was basic, and the screen was small, but information on it was easy to read. I paired my phone (and made sure to delete it when done) and it worked well as a hands-free system. I don't think music worked through Bluetooth, but I had my charging cable with me anyway, and using it ""docked"" my iPhone, and the music played through that. Sound of the stereo was great. Local radio stations, even in the mountains, was good. It had XM, and only in the mountains did we have problems with signal. The trunk swallowed all we put in it, although I had to use my Tetris skills since we brought so much. My car had 3 driving modes, Eco, Sport and """" (nothing showed on the dash).  I kept it in Eco, and while it would have to search for a gear when I needed to get up and go (it would be in or near that gear in sport) acceleration once that was sorted was really good. Dispatching left lane hogs on the highways of Pennsylvania was easy, a blip of the throttle and a few seconds, and I could jump from 55 to 80. Overall, a really good car, I was sad to see it go at the end. I finished with about 30mpg (miles/gallons, not from the computer), at an average speed of 45 mph (from the computer). My highway stints got me 36.5 mpg from Indy to New Jersey, and an amazing 40 mpg on the way back on a flatter route. In mixed driving I still got 26 mpg."

"Riding comfy  Great car for the price! This is the first Hyundai I've ever owned and I am pleasantly surprised by  how comfortable, roomy, and affordable that it is to drive. I will definitely but another Hyundai down the road."
"Great car !!! I like almost 98 percent !!!  I am surprise with this SONATA SE, I bought this car almost 5 months ago, right now has almost 9,000 miles on it (Mainly in highway) everything works awesome; I got  average millage on my long trips around 35MPG and mixed with the city around 32MPG.  Quiet, huge internal space, fast, a lot of technology inside, I just care connect to my Android, this feature works perfect, I cancelled any music service, I don't need them, I have my cell connected a 100% full working (Pandora, spotify, I heart radio, google maps, text without typing, etc).  The only thing that I don't like from the car is every morning when I started the car sounds like old machine, but after a few minutes, goes quiet. The performance of the car is the same as 6 months ago. and the price $16,500 was unbeatable !!!"
Feeling safer  Everything is great so far. The only knock would be the low ground clearance on the front end.
"Leased for two days, couldn't find a single fault.  I've been renting cars for a while now and often find myself creating mental lists of the things that annoy me about various vehicles, normally four or five things that would make me not want to own it. I was pleasantly surprised when the Sonata didn't have any. Okay, maybe it had too many features, but that isn't a problem so much as something I just don't need. It was great for a Christmas holiday where the huge trunk was filled with packages. But the drive was pretty amazing. The car likes to go, and it glides at any speed taking turns with ease. The transmission is smooth, the breaks are there when you want and need them. And you have more than enough power without using too much gasoline. And it hugs the road extremely well making highway driving a dream. I was curious to see how much you would have to spend for a vehicle that feels as if you're driving a luxury model and was shocked at how inexpensive it is. Though I'm not familiar with its safety ratings or repair costs, if you are looking for a mid-size vehicle, I would check the Sonata out. The only downside may be that you may end up with lots of speeding tickets because this car is extremely easy to accidentally take up to 90-100 mph without even realizing it."
"Hyundai Sonata Review  Sleek styling, comfortable ride, adequate pick-up and plenty of room for passengers and cargo.  Environmental (heating) takes a bit longer to warm up the cabin, but gets there.  Could use more air flow to the feet.  Handles firmly on the road, but road noise is louder than expected.  Overall good value for the money."
"Love this car  Excellent vehicle,,smooth ride"
"Good car, TERRIBLE corporate support !  I returned to the dealer the first thing the next morning after I discovered there was a paperwork error that overlooked applying the Hyundai BOOSTUP savings program in my purchase.  BOOSTUP is a savings matching program found on the Hyundai web site. To date, I have recieved, through my dealer, my original $500 deposit, but NOT THE HYUNDAI MATCHING.  AFTER 8 MONTHS !  ""Things take a long time to be resolved with Hyundai"" said the Sales Manager.  Wow, do they ever.  This was confirmed by the BOOSTUP customer service rep, who said the very same thing.   The Williamsburg, VA dealer has resubmitted documents requests several times from Hyundai, as have I.  Neither one of us have gotten a satisfactory conclusion to our requst to have the matching BOOSTUP processed.   Stall, stall stall.  Hyundai owes me $ 500.  IT'S THAT SIMPLE.  My overall rating is soured by the failure of Hyundai to resolve a simple problem.  In short, the Sonata seems to be a good value, but don't count on Hyundai to back the dealer or the customer.  This is an issue that Edmonds does not include in its review questions. The customer support by the manufacturer is overlooked.  For that, I rate Hyundai one star.Update June 2017:  After involving the local franchise owner directly an empowered Hyundai rep got involved. Howerver, it still took an addituonal 3 months before I recieved my BoostUp."
"Hyundai Sonata ECO- The Fastest Sonata of them All  Prior to purchasing my ECO I saw a review about this car on line. I called two dealers and they had no idea what I was talking about when I said I wanted to read test a Sonata ECO. The third dealership I called said they thought they had an ECO on the back lot. It was a 2015 ECO and it was quite dirty, as it had not been moved or driven  in many weeks. Anyway, we took it on a road test and my wife and i were impressed with the spaciousness of the interior and the trunk...huge.  The car rode smoothly  and handled well for a huge sedan and the brakes felt very good as well. The salesman explained the three modes of the 7 speed dual clutch automatic transmission, similar to the type found on Porsches and Ferrari's...Normal, ECO,and SPORT. Normal and ECO modes made the Sonata drive like any other midsize 4 cylinder car, but the transmission super quick shifts made the car seem quicker. Then I selected SPORT mode...and holy crap! this car flew off the line, actually spinning the front tires when the turbo kicked in at 1500 rpm. I have seen road tests from Car and Driver where the ECO hits 0 to 60 in 6.5 seconds and does 92 mph in the quarter mile. Needless to say, I ordered the 2016 ECO and I have not been disappointed. My previous car was a 2003 Toyota Corolla. This Sonata is literally twice as big on the inside and the trunk is 50%  bigger. Front seat legroom is amazing...I can fully extend both legs while driving. And the electric seat offers many adjustments. Gas mileage around town is 3-4 miles per gallon more in the Sonata compared to the Corolla. A recent trip upstate with 4 full size adults in the car gave 34.5 miles per gallon.  Buy a 2016 ECO before Hyundai does something stupid and decreases its performance, because it is much faster that Hyundai's  2.0 turbo that has 75 more horsepower and costs many thousands of dollars more than the ECO.  And, my ECO is still not yet broken in, with only 3700 miles on the odometer."
"Highly Recommend-  Purchased a 2016 sonata se- Did my research on other cars- including an Altima, Accord, Camry and Mazda6. And oh boy, my head was spinning and hard to make a decision, specially since I am tall, 6ft 2in. And finding a vehicle that would be comfortable is quite a struggle for me. Until I looked into the Sonata- For the money and feautures you get- I could not complain! Back up camera and Android Auto is phenomenal!!! Works 100% of the time and to top it off- The gas mileage- I drive about 60 miles a day and what I can say is it does really good- I average 32-33 mpg! The vehicle accelerates just fine- it brings me up to speed whenever I need it. We are a family of three- And really recommend to test drive the vehicle. The color I purchased mine was Red exterior color with Beige interior- Tint the windows and you got yourself a good looking car!!!"
"Sonata, so far so good  I love the ride, the quietness and the way it handles the road. For some reason the blue tooth doesn't support reading or responding to text messages.  Love everything else though."

"Worth every Penny spent on this Car.  I bought a 2016 Sonata SE base model which comes with Fabric seats and 7"" screen and 16"" alloy wheels default. Car is So Good. Seat feels little elevated compared to other sedans on roads and can feel that thrill. Fuel economy is Fantastic. I drive local and freeway and get a combined economy of 30 MPG which is great for car of this size and for long freeway drive it would actually go up to 36 MPG. Steering feels so good and comfortable, Controls mounted on steering are easy to play around. Shifter operating is so smooth. Apple carplay helps my phone displayed virtually on the screen and it is easy to operate around.  Getting In & Out of car is easy, If you would like to go for a bigger sedan I would recommend Sonata. They have best in the Industry warranty. I personally enjoy the vehicle in each drive."
"The car of my dreams!  The Sonata is comfortable ,fun to drive and a great value!"
Review  
"Nagging Navigation  Paid extra to have the navigation package.  My phones Google Maps is faster at both looking up an address and recalculating when directions change.  Voice recognition has trouble understanding commands in normal road conditions, even worse with a window down or the sun roof open...disappointing for the money spent!"
Watch your spare  no spare tire only a repair kit(
"Overlooked gem  Awesome value. Bought it for one of my kids. I am comparing it to my Mercedes CLA-250 ( eco fvs cla) : Similar, small turbo engine 1.6L vs 2.0L.  Similar torque and torque curve. 198 foot/lbs available from 1500 RPM and up.  Both cars are pleasant to drive, esp.  compared to the screaming high rev downshifts of the 2.4l baseline engine. Both cars have a dual clutch 7 speed tranny. The eco's tranny seems to work better, and faster. Price paid: 18.5 K vs 35K. Neither has a spare tire.   Tires: 16 inch Michelin Energy  vs. 17"" low profile Pirelli run-flats.   Handling, road feel: Hyundai cannot beat a German car as of yet. The benz wins here.   Fit and finish, rattles:Hyundai wins.  Example: 2x hydraulic hood suppors on the hyundai, cheap metal stick for the Benz. Seriously?   Brakes: Hyundai wins so far. The benz had the front rotors replaced at 20K and now needs new rotors again at 38K. (Uneven wear, thickness variation)  Warranty: hyundai wins, (6/64 vs 4/48)  although the turbo is not part of the power train, so not 10/100 only 6/64. Seriously?  Excellent fuel eco ( 35 vs 36 in mixed driving, 40 vs 42 on highway. Gasoline: Hyundai runs fine w normal vs Benz needs Super (runs noticeably worse on anything less).   Looks: the benz wins hands down.  Back seat comfort: The benz back seats are for 2 small adults or childen. The eco has OK back seats.  Gripes: the Benz windshield sucks. I am on my 2nd one,  it  seems to crack easily.  Both brands are goin to an overpriced ""bundled service"" model, invented by some marketing genius.  Benz A service is $200 , B service is $400.  The former is a glorified oil change, witness my service invoices.  Way overpriced. Hyundai is attempting to go to a similar model, with a long list of ""check this and inspect that"" and charge an insane amount of money. Check out the service brochure and you will see what I mean. They try to present this travesty as a fantastic deal, as in if you commit to have them maintain your car, they give you some money off the insanely overinflated scheduled service cost."
Nice value for money  SONATA IS good car to buy and use the features.are.great and technology is most latest for the same range of cars . I found more.sporty and powerfully than accord smooth and silent operations. Overall great value  for money.
"Gave Hyundai another chance!!!!!!!  My first Hyundai I bought in 1993. This was my first car ever. It was a 1993 Hyundai Excel GS. After a 6 months of having the car I begin to have trouble. The check engine light came on. When I pushed the clutch in the car shut off. After several trips to the dealership, the cause was the ground wire to the engine had broke. Well by then I didn't want the car. I said that I would never purchase another Hyundai. Well I was wrong!!!!! I was looking for another car due to a my 3 year old kicking my seats in my 2007 Volkswagen Jetta. My heart was set on a 2014 Toyota Camry. Well I was introduced to the 2016 Hyundai Sonata. Let me tell you!!!! This car is crazy!!!!! Hyundai did their homework and research! Excellence is all I can say. I really am enjoying this Hyundai. I hope and pray nothing happens to it but if it does, I will buy another one. Too may awesome features to name. GREAT JOB HYUNDAI!!!!!!!!!"
Happy Camper  This has been an excellent experience so far with the Hyundai Sonata Limited and look forward to the next one in 3 years.
"What a Value  I bought a 2016 SE to replace my totaled 2013 Outback.  I have had the car for 3 weeks and have 1500 miles on it.  So far it has been great.  I was initially attracted to the car due to the value.  I received 5k off MSRP and was out the door for less than $20k.  The only other midsize car that I could have gotten for a similar price was a VW Jetta and the Hyundai beat it in almost every way.  In no way do I feel I compromised by not going with a more expensive midsize sedan (Accord, Camry, etc). The only feature that we did not get in this car that we wanted was heated seats (3k more to get the trim/options just to get the heating seats).  Everything else we were looking for was included in the SE.  7 inch entertainment system with bluetooth/android auto, steering wheel controls, keyless entry, alloy wheels, and the best warranty out there.  The car drives very smooth and was completely comfortable on a 800 mile road trip.  I cruised at 80 with no issues and returned over 35 mpg on the trip with about 50 miles of heavy city driving thrown in.  Car is quiet and smooth.  The entertainment system is very responsive.  The bluetooth syncs faster than any other car I have used.  Rear seats have more space than the outback (we have very large car seats that fit just fine).  Hopefully it proves to be reliable."

uncomfortable  I have a Sonata Limited 4 cylinder.  The seats are extremely uncomfortable after an hour of driving.  Car is way under powered.
"2016 Sonata Limited 2.4 L all options  I bought the 2016 Sonata for myself and my wife got a 2016 Camry XLE a week earlier. I'm very familiar with both. I'm glad I got the Sonata, I prefer it over the Camry (more comfortable, quieter) and my wife has been driving Camrys since 1994 so I know that car well.  There are many things that I don't use but I knew that going in. The moon roof is only usable at night or late in the afternoon due to the sun. The lane departure warnings (where the car watches the lines in the road and beeps if I cross them) is annoying most of the time but I have not turned it off just in case. The blind side monitor is great (the outside mirror lights up if someone is in either blind spot) and if I use the directional signals while someone is in my blind spot, I get a warning. Dynamic cruise control is of little use to me because if the traffic is that heavy, I don't want to be on cruise control anyway. So why did I pay for so may things that I have little use for?  To get the what matters most - automatic emergency breaking. That's what is supposed to stop the car if someone stops in front of me and I don't see them or if a kid runs in front of the car and I don't see him. My guess is that within 10 years AEB will be as mandatory as seat belts on all new cars. I like a big car that moves over the road with no noise and I got that with the Sonata. It's not rated as a large car but it feels that way to me. It's hard to believe that this has a 2.4 liter engine. The car moves as effortlessly on the highway as 5 liter V8 cars that I've owned. I drove this for a month in Phoenix over the very nice freeways that they have during low volume traffic (weekends, etc). Those people seem to have one speed that they all drive at (80 mph) and the Sonata did that with no wind or road noise and the tach was hovering at about 2200 rpm.  Mixed mileage is about 30 or 31 but if I keep it at 65mph on the highway, I'll get around 40 mpg. The GPS is a little better than the one in the Camry but giving it directions by voice is a hit or miss proposition and to type a destination, you have to be stopped. Mine has memory seats which is great if on a long trip and my wife does some of the driving. I have it set so that the seat does NOT move back when I turn the car off. All in all, this is probably the best car I ever owned and I'm very particular.Update after 9 months: I still think this is the best car I've ever owned. Some things I missed during the first review - the emergency brake disengages automatically when I shift out of park and the outside rear view mirrors tilt down when in reverse to show the road.Update after 21 months: Still think this is the best car I ever owned."
"Im leasing this car  I love it.  I upgraded from an '09 Ford Focus so honestly this is a huge upgrade.  I got the Limited package with the tech package.  Its amazing.  It rides well, the entertainment package is awesome, the infinity speakers are great, I love the ventilated seat and the heated seats.  The heated steering wheel is a cool feature.  The sport mode tightens the steering up and it handles like a dream and it nicely adds a little get up and go.  The ECO mode adds gas mileage while going down the highway.  The normal driving mode is a nice drive too.  I love this car and it was between this and the kia optima with the tech package.  I loved both cars and they are both on the same body but I got a better deal on the Sonata for a lease.  They honestly handle the same and amenities are the same, however I did like the Harmon and Kardon speakers a little better than the infiinities.  But, Im confident in the Sonata and the features are great.  I would definitely lease another one after this lease is up.  If you're on the fence between this and anything else, pull the trigger you wont regret it.  Especially if you are coming from a car like the ford focus or some other compact car.  The space is literally uncomparable.  I could fit 2 Ford ""Foci"" in this car.  (Obvious hyperbole, kinda)"
new sonata  this is by far the best Hyundai we have owned and this is number 5. it is a fine car for a reasonable amount of money even if it cost more than our first house .
"Best car ever  Hyundai was never on my radar for a new car, but the 2016 Sonata Limited is by far the best car I have ever owned. Great value and warranty - awesome ride, sound system superb and all the bells and whistles - can't be beat. I am faithful to a product I like - I owned Mercury products from 1972 until the end - switched to Chevy. Did lots of research before this purchase - best money spent. An update. 21000 miles on the car now. Only time in shop was normal maintenance. In this cold weather loving the heated seats and heated steering wheel. As many bells and whistles as a Benz or Jag and Lisa than half the price. Still loving this car."
"Good car  The 2.4L engine is a little noisy but has good power and good fuel economy. The handling and ride is good.  I like the interior and the layout of the dash. We got a nice discount from list price, and the dealership gave a lifetime drivetrain warranty. The transmission is terribly worrisome. It ruins an otherwise good automobile."
"Well satisfied  We have been very pleased with this vehicle.   It is smooth riding, and the safety features are outstanding.  The electronics are amazing, and the economy is great, getting up to 37 mpg on the highway.  The convenience features are much appreciated, especially the heated steering wheel in the winter, and the A/C cooled front seats in the summer."
living the dream  I love the car I chose. I am very frugal so to me I spent more than I wanted. Love the safety features but wish you did not have to purchase packages to obtain them. I guess you pay for the quality you get. I am happy every time I get in my car to go somewhere. It is a joy.
"Had Everything, but Interior Flatlined the Deal  If you like the Camry, the Sonata needs to be at the top of your test drive list! This is an outstanding feature packed, comfortable, great daily driver. And the different configurations and add on pkgs allow you to get what you want without having to shell out $ for things you could care less about. My favorite feature on the Sport version are the seats. They have the sports fabric down the middle, w/leather side bolsters, and you still get the heated seat feature. The Sonata Sport and the Chrysler 200S  are the only mid size sedans I found that offer this combo. I really tried to convince myself to get this car; it had everything on my checklist for a fantastic price. But, the interior read bland, plastic, and souless to me, I just couldn't see myself being happy driving it everyday. Ended up purchasing the 2016 Kia Optima EX w/premium pkg instead - liked the sportier exterior & interior styling much better."
"Fantastic Upgrade!!  I love it!!!! I was trying to get out of my '14 Sentra SV that I felt I was over paying for. Only 1.5k miles on the car and I love the change to a larger sedan, I get almost the same gas mileage as I had with my Sentra by driving on the freeways a bit more that surface streets. It has the power for me to navigate traffic with ease. I also ended up getting the sport edition with quite a few of the additional packages, and I love everything I got, and its definitely worth the ~$100 difference in my payments. My only wish is that the BlueLink last longer, or was less expensive to renew. It's definitely worth looking into, it's about 10 times the car other manufacturers were trying to sell me."

"I like the car very much.  Purchased new Sonata; Silver, SE in March 2016. Now have 4000 miles on the odo. Replaced OEM Khumo Solus tires with Continental TrueContacts at 900 miles. Transformed the car's ride and handling, much quieter, as well. I'm using the manual shift mode with the auto setting on sport which increases the steering effort. Downshifts from 4th to 3rd are sometimes abrupt. I'm accelerating more aggressively, though not revving past 4500-5000 rpm. The engine is quick and smooth with no hesitation or flat spots. Still haven't floored it 100%. Not sure what the Edmund review meant by ""unrefined engine"". Changed the break-in oil and filter at 3200 miles; the oil was very dirty. Using Mobil 1 Full Synthetic with factory oil filters and will change both every 5000 miles. I check the oil every week and the level is exactly the same each week. Debating whether or not to install a K&N Oil Screen engine air filter. Will continue to search the web to see if anyone else has done so. The radio switches back and forth from regular to HD on weaker stations often, very annoying. There doesn't seem to be any way to reset the sensitivity level or manually select or or the other. I listen to my Ipod most of the time anyway. I will NOT continue the satellite radio or the On-star. In fact, I placed a piece of electrical tape over that annoying blue light. Getting 30.4 mpg in mixed driving. Using Sunoco regular octane exclusively and Techron fuel system cleaner every 4th tank. It's quiet, comfortable, rides and handles very well. It's a good looking car, too. Overall I really like the car. Despite the traffic and crappy Central Pennsylvania roads, it's fun to drive. Looking forward to lots of trouble-free miles."
"One and a half years, still a very good buy.  Traded in my Honda Civic (purchased in Jan 2016), for a 'new' Sonata two months later.  I found quality issues with the Civic, that Honda did not address after a lot of complaints.  I've now had the Sonata a year and a half.  Here are my thoughts.   It is still the best car you can get for the amount of dollars you spend, because:1. It has had very low maintenance cost.  Other than oil changes, tire rotations and wheel alignment, there has not been any other items that I've needed.  Sure the dealership tries to push you to do extra items, but the manual says I am fine so far.   2. You get significantly more equipment in it per dollars.  My Sports version has the larger wheels and rims, 7 inch entertainment system with android and apple compatibility, (that is standard on the 2017 models in all trims).3. Gas mileage has gotten even better, for such a big car (that is how it is classified by the EPA), runs at 34 mpg on average with mixed driving.  However, if on the highway for long trips, it easily runs between 38 to 43 mpg, if you are not driving it like a maniac.  4. Service with my dealer so far has been good.  I have a light tan interior (no one eats in my car) and I check it thoroughly after each service and there is not hint of smudge or grease.5.  It just looks stately, when I approach it and I smile. 6. The entertainment system is one of the easiest to use without having to go through a manual.  Negatives:1. I noticed it when I purchased the car, but decided it was not a deal breaker.  But acceleration is tepid, and it is more noticeable if you drive or rent it's sister car (with the same engine), the Kia Optima.  2. There's a slight hesitation around 3000 to 4000 rpm, which you have to step on the gas to avoid.  It is not there, in Optima vehicles that I've driven.3. The nice smooth floating ride is great, but it takes away from the more accurate steering feel that I've noticed in late mode Optimas.  Update (I was able to improve the handling a bit, by putting more air in my tires). 4. I do wish now, that it was a little smaller, like the new Chevrolet Malibu.  So would I switch for the Optima?  No, the features that come standard on my car, cost about $2,000 more in a package on the Optima.  Although I looked at the Accord and Camry, the Sonata and Optima, remain my mid-size favorites."
"Really great car, with one hiccup.  Updated, after a year:We spent several weeks researching and test driving different cars before deciding on the Sonata, and then at the last minute saw the value in bumping up to the Sport model with sunroof and other goodies at a bargain.Overall we're very impressed with the car. It feels luxurious and solid, and a quiet ride was an important thing to note as we test drove cars. Turned out though that after all that testing and deciding, we didn't actually test drive the Sport model before we bought it, thinking it was basically the same car as a standard Sonata, just with a sunroof. But now I know the Sport model comes with different low profile tires which makes for more road noise than the standard Sonata. Still, this is quieter than most, and reviews online say that it will lose more road noise with updated tires. The stock tires get really bad reviews. After a year,  I now know that what I feel is a slight dancing of the front wheels at cruising speed (compared to my well-tracking heavy full-size truck), probably will not go away with new tires. It's from the electronic steering system, compared to standard hydraulic steering that most cars use. Rather than a smooth rotation of the steering wheel and tires, what I feel as I make those slight corrections at freeway speed is nothing, nothing, then too much. This is something you have to drive the car a while to notice, and on really smooth roads. I didn't notice it with test drives. If you look up this issue specifically, you'll find forum discussion about it.There are three different settings for the steering that the dealership can change in five minutes. It's normal, sport, and something else. I had it changed once, to sport I think, and didn't notice a difference. My wife doesn't notice it--or just thinks it's normal, so I haven't messed with it again, but plan to try another of the settings when we take it in for the next oil change.Android Auto has a lot of cool features--like GPS and Pandora, but it's really clunky that the phone must be plugged-in at this stage of bluetooth technology. This is primarily my wife's car, and she simply doesn't bother with it, so those features are lost to her. There are now a couple small squeaks that are from the surprisingly tight fit of the interior. For example, there is no gap between the dashboard and pillars, and I suspect it's this tightness of fit where I'm getting squeaks. As I do in my truck, I'll eventually locate the noises and slip cardboard or something in as a washer between squeaking surfaces. Again though, of everything we looked at, the Sonata really stood out. It looks good, is small enough for a daily commuter, but comfortable and roomy for a long drive, with spacious and comfortable rear seats--which was in fact the first thing I looked at, by sitting in the back seat first. At the rate my wife drives, this car will last well beyond the average.While I originally knocked fuel economy--because our average was coming in under 30, it now runs around 30, 32 on road trips, which is closer to the rated mileage."
2016 Sonata Sport  
"Stepped Down from a Genesis to a Sonata  Love it so far! My first new car in 7 years, and I am impressed at all the different safety features, the expanded bluetooth, etcApril 11 2016.Other than a cranky driver's side seat belt retractor, everything is still working fine. I understand there is a recall regarding the seatbelt, and will have that taken care of at the next service. Otherwise, still pleased at my choice."
"2016 sport/limited  Great overall value.  Comfort level is good with seats, multi position electric drivers seat is roomy and comfortable, however, my knee seems to be pinned against the shift console so I have to move the seat back further than I'm comfortable with.  Same with my previous sonata(2011).. Technology features with android auto are great.  Didn't come with garage opener remote. that option was 10 times the cost of ordering another remote and clipping it to the visor...So far with econo function engaged I'm averaging 35 mpg."
Great value  
"Above Competition  I am spending 2.5 hours every working day in the car: to me it is not choosing ""just a car"", but a second home and office. I have invested a lot of time in selecting a new vehicle. Each one of us has different criteria when selecting a vehicle. My top ones were: 1. Ride Comfort 2. Quietness on a highway 3. Ability to absorb road imperfections 4. Android Auto/Apple Car Play as a lot of paid options become unnecessary  with personal assistance of the these tools and navigation/online music and talk shows. Here are the reasons I did not buy competitors: Accord EX (pros: awesome screens and interior quality, nice open layout, camera on the mirror, handling; cons: suspension is on the stiffer side, road imperfections are quite noticeable). Altima (pros: the most comfortable seats; cons: engine noise, no Android Auto(AA)). Fusion (great car overall, but the cabin layout is claustrophobic, rear seat room is the smallest, no AA). 2016 Malibu (looks awesome, but the ride is on a somewhat stiffer side, interior is simply ""fine""). Camry LE (everything is in place, but it lacks Android Auto/Apple Car, which serves as a live personal assistant during the trip, smaller screen. It falls behind in technology equipment). Sonata is the car where all my stars have lined up: it has definitely the smoothest ride of the bunch, the car irons out all the cracks in the pavement - you do not feel them nor hear them. Sonata is the quietest car on a highway - no tire noise, no wind noise, it feels and rides like a luxury car, even though I got the entry level model without a single option. Cabin layout is very open, you constantly ""feel"" spaciousness especially with the light interior (light gray or beige). Sonata has a very confident handling, and there is absolutely no ""floatiness"" as you would normally feel with softer suspensions. Entry-level model comes with the most equipment compared to the cars above: nice 7"" HD screen with lots of features (XM data - traffic, weather), high-quality HD backup camera, AA works perfect, seats are comfortable on my long rides, and the price tag is unbelievable if you know how to negotiate - very low 18,000s. The sound system generates an unexpectedly good sound quality - it is not what you would think to get in a ""stripped-down model"". Paired with the cabin quietness the sound is very good. If you choose very nice options like panoramic sunroof, heated/cooled leather seats and a plethora of safety/electronic features, adaptive cruise control, super stereo system - prepare to pay at least 50% more. In my case - it was not worth the extra money, but everyone is different. Paired with 5 year full/10-year powertrain warranty and very low maintenance costs this Sonata SE is my perfect choice to be my 2nd home/office for the next 5 years."
Great!  We love the car. We are repeat buyers.
Skid's Review  My wife and I loved this car and would have purchased the 2016 model but the exterior/interior color selections did not meet our requirement.  We wanted a red or white exterior with a black leather interior.  These combinations are not available.  The only color interior available is light beige or light grey.  Both show dirt too easily.  The same held true for the KIA Optima.  We ended up buying a Subaru Outback; Pearl white with black leather.  We love it.

"Good deal on Sonata Sport  When I originally set out to purchase a  Sonata, I was not looking to acquire the Sport model.  However, during the process of contacting various dealerships online, I was offered a nice deal on a 2016 Sonata Sport.  After negotiating a bit more, I was able to purchase a Sonata Sport, which has a several desirable features, at the same cost a regular Sonata.  Make sure to do your research on available rebates and the 3% that the dealer receives from the manufacturer.  Knowing that the invoice price is not the actual cost of the car will definitely make negotiation easier."
"Comfort, bells and whistles but still cheap  If you are after a vehicle that has a lot of space and nice features - like a backup camera, adjustable passenger seat (height, too!), automatic mirrors, etc., for a low price, you may consider the Hyundai Sonata 2016.    It has tons of passenger room and the seats are pretty comfortable.The turning circle for a car this size is great (much better than the Accord, for example).   It also has a surprisingly quiet ride and is not too bumpy.However, Hyundai still does not know how to make a good engine.   When you start your car in the morning, it rattles and taps like an old sewing machine.   After a bit it quiets down.   Also, at a stop when you are idling, it will start to vibrate a lot.   It sometimes seems to shudder upon acceleration or even sometimes coming to a stop.Thankfully it has a good warranty, but if you do not follow the maintenance rules exactly, they will void your warranty in a heartbeat.   It is probably best to get them to do the oil changes, even, so that they can't say you did not do it properly.   Hyundai is notorious for trying to bug out of honoring their warranty."

SO GOOD SONATA  FRONT SEAT ADJUSTMENT NOT ELECTRIC. OLD SCHOOL .FOR THE MPGS AND COMFORT OF THE INTERIOR IT SOMETHING I CAN LIVE WITH. RIDES SMOOTH AND QUIET.LOVE THIS CAR!
"car does not age well.  Since I bought the car a Hyundai certified 2015 Hyundai Sonata with approximately 25k miles. I had several issues, after just a week of owning the car the driver side mirror trim started showing discoloration, it was black and shinny when I bought the car. The first time I took the car on the highway, I felt a slight shaking on the steering wheel, took it the dealership to have the wheel balance check and I was told by the manager that they couldn’t do nothing about it since it is not part of the warranty (when I asked the manager if they check the wheel balance on the certification inspection he said he didn’t know), the service clerk went to speak with my sales person to see if the sales dept. would cover the cost of the wheel balancing job, however, per the service clerk ( the sales rep never came out to talk to me) they declined covering the service request. On my first interior cleaning, I noticed that the driver seat had a hole on the left side support, also the leather dye faded out and I can see the foam underneath and the right rear passenger seat leather was coming out of the headrest cover, I contacted Hyundai USA and their advice was to take it to the dealer for evaluation, at the dealer the service clerk said that the hole and fading was under warranty and they’ll fix it but I had to leave the car at the dealership for at least a day, when I asked if I could have a loaner car for the day, he said that they didn’t offer any loaners, so I decided to wait for an opportunity in which I didn’t need the car to leave it. Now on a trip to Orlando with my family, the shark fin antenna came out the antenna base on the highway, I presume. I contacted Hyundai USA and I got the same answer as before, take it to the dealer for evaluation, the antenna is only cover for 3 years or 36k miles, of course I was out of warranty. At the dealer, the service rep didn’t even look at it, she said that it is a common issue, but it is not a defect???? and that I was out of warranty, while there I asked when I the upholstery technician was going to be onsite to leave my car and she said that I was out of warranty on my car seat as well. Overall, don’t believe the dealership certification inspection, I bought the car confident that I wasn’t going to encounter any issues with the car, but I was completely wrong, the inspection is just a gimmick to charge more for a car and/or cover defects to trick the costumer into buying a car that looks a lot better at the dealer and while Hyundai offer 10 years/100k miles warranty on the engine and transmission everything else that seems to fall apart only have a 3 year/36k warranty, the car rides nice and its very spacious but the overall quality of the car is sub par to other brands."
"Everybody thinks it's a Lexus!  137,000 miles. Other than Basic maintenance no problems! The 2015 SE version of this car is an amazing value with distinct character that got lost in the yearly updates. Space is abundant, led drl, low drivers seating position, BMW like interior and feel. If your interested in this car get the 2015 se version. It's the cheapest model and it's highly customizable not having all the extra tech. BTW mags say this car is slow but it's not, put it in sport and it will easily pass other cars."
The car to buy  Very reliable car and outstanding gas mileage
A beast in the snow.  I live in Central New York where we have 9 months of winter and 3 months of bad sledding.  I have never had to buy snow tires and she is a beast in the snow. I love this car. Gas mileage averaged 30 mph just putting around town and 36 mph on the highway. Cried when it was totalled. I love this car.
great car  Top of line car  glad we found this car on dealer lot
"Conflict feelings  The design really gives a feeling of the quality but for the 3 years I had the car, the coating of the shifter knob peeled off, the door handle of the passenger's door fell off all the sudden by itself, and controlling the phone (scrolling through call history and contacts list) stopped working. I took the dealer over 2 week to order the parts and replace the shifter knob and door handle. The dealer acknowledged the flaw of controlling the phone but they didn't take any action to fix it. The car  is very comfortable, quiet, and handle well but the acceleration is disappointing for a 2.4L engine. I've owned and drove cars with 2.0, 2.4, and 2.5 engines that performed better than this engine."

2015 Sonata  Great car for road trips!
"Happy Driver  Terrific blending of style, comfort, reliability, and economic performance. Having owned everything from Toyotas and Mustangs to Jaguars and Cadillacs, this mid-sized sedan meets my current needs with flare and driving fun. Plenty of power to merge, pull up the Rocky Mountains, or lay down miles across the wide open spaces of Nevada. Change the oil, occasionally service, gas it up and watch it keep going!"
Reliable and comfortable car  It's a great automobile.
Great car for the money!  I short yearn lease this vehicle for ride share.  This car is amazing.  I feel like I’m drive a luxgery sedan. It handles and drives like a sporty v6.  Mpg could be better but the feel of the car and comfort of the drivers seat make up for it!  But the car you won’t be disappointed!
"Great sedan for the money  The gas milage on the 4 cy is fantastic.....seating comfort: above average........recoil on seat belts is weak, but functional......smooth ride on hwy/roads.......not a car for fast acceleration......everyone loves the backseats, roomy"
Car no good  Fianance the car at 45k miles at 109k miles the whole engine locked after a oil change trash car
"Keep away......here my warnings  This car is the MOST UNreliable car I've owned in over 40 years!!! This thing has standed me hundreds of miles from home TWICE in two years!! First, Fayetteville NC...fuel injectors...gone!   A twenty something kid b/sing me ...""oh yeah parts are on the way ..tomorrow ...NOT!! 5 lovely days ....hotel meals and lots of $$$$. Hyundai did reimbursed me $290.. Out of the $700+ it cost me to interrupt my trip......THIS time I'm in Boston 1500 miles from home and the crank shaft seal goes...oil all over!!!  I thought Fayetteville was bad! Boston IS very expensive to have to stay around!  $$$$$. Parts to fix the car.?...I'm 7 days into this....""MAYBE end of the week...MAYBE first of next week!!!!   I'm sure Hyundai will reimburse me their standard $300 for 3 days!  I'm into this problem over a grand now...and they're fixing the car for free!!   What a piece of JUNK!!!"
PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAR FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!  Look up all the Hyundai Sonata Class Action Lawsuits and research before you purchase this vehicle. My vehicle is a 2015 and in 2 years and less than 55000 miles my engine gave up. Hyundai wishes to wash their hands clean of this with me and the dealership says their hands are tied even though I STILL HAVE WARRANTY!
"Hyundai is the Harbor Freight of the car world.  When we narrowed our choices down to the Sonata or the Accord, the price and warranty of the Sonata seemed to make our decision easy. Initially, the vehicle was amazing, despite the abundant road noise, that we didn't seem to notice when we were purchasing it. However, things quickly went downhill. Within a few months, little things started going bad and we were constantly dropping it off at the dealership to fix the heated seats, automatic breaking, BSD system, heated steering wheel, traction control, TPM system and so on. Like harbor freight, the vehicle was ""comparable"" to others in its class, but at a sacrifice of quality. We figured that its okay, because the warranty would cover us, which it still does, but constantly dropping it off at the dealership became cumbersome and now we have issues that we just leave, because its not worth the time of not having the vehicle. Current issues: the backup camera takes almost ten seconds to turn on when you put it in reverse / the automatic mirror tilt when you put it in reverse, doesn't always work / a ""Check BSD System"" light flashes every so often / the memory seats don't always work when you push the button / it brakes randomly, even when no one is in front of us (I try not to even use the cruise control anymore) / bluetooth doesn't always sync, on multiple devices. There's probably more that I'm forgetting. The other issue is that the vehicle doesn't have a remote start function from the remote. The only way to get remote start is to pay a yearly subscription fee to Bluelink or purchase aftermarket, which we were told would void the warranty unless we paid a fortune to have it done at the dealership. We did not know this when we purchased the vehicle and thought that Bluelink was free with the vehicle. I guess that one's on us; we should have checked. If you don't mind continually taking your vehicle in for service and you want a deal, then the Sonata is for you. For me, I think next time we'll just pay the extra money for the accord."

Great Ride just hard to get in and out!!!!!!  This is a great all around car!!!!!!   It does have an issue with hard to get in and out of due to the low roof design.  Great for people five foot eight and less.
Lots of convenience features  Hyundai has more features as standard in the Limited model than you would find in the higher priced competition with their standard equipment package. Why would anyone want to buy one of the high priced spread cars when this one has everything you would want. Have only owned it for 4 weeks and love it. Previous vehicle was also a Hyundai.
Great Value  These cars are a great option at their curent price range
Big Red  Difficulty entering and exiting for those with mobility issues due to the high rise of door inside door seals.
"Absolutely a Keeper  Have owned BMW, Caddys ! Now 2 Hyundais. Never needed repair! Great acceleration! Trunk holds 4 sets of golf clubs and interior is spacious! I am only one in my foresome that has a car to hold all of us on a road trip! 30 mpg and fast! Great car!!!"
I love it for the most part!  I heard a lot of bad things about this vehicle recall wise. I like my vehicle so far! I hope it's worth it.
2015 Sonata  I continue to be impressed with the purchase of a 2015 Sonata. I keep asking family if they like the car as much as I do. It's an incredible value.
great car  Very stylish car and very comfortable to drive. Quiet ride with good entertainment features. Love to drive this car and my kids want to take it every chance they can.
"Great car for the price!  Tried all kinds of sedans, and the Sonata had the most features and space for the price. My husband is 6' 3"", so having head and legroom for him was a must. The only feature I wish it had is auto on/off  headlights.  My last car had that, so I left the lights on by accident a couple times."
"Great bang for the buck  I have had a total of 5 Hyundais​ now (4 Sonata Limited, and 1 Genesis). I've owned BMW 5 series, and a Mercedes 500 SL (both nice cars), but Hyundai is by far the best bang for your money you can get. My only negative of the '15 Sonata is they didn't offer a v6 in it. Everything else is great.  On a side note, my fully loaded '15 Genesis is a better car than either the BMW 5 series or Mercedes E series. The question I get most often when people see my Genesis? ""What kind of car is that? A Bentley?"""

"Under valued no regrets  Hated cold steering wheels and interior noise. This car eliminated both. With heated steering wheel & seats my 75th winter isn't nearly as tough to take. Talking on phone is better in this car than in the house, much quieter.  Safety features with sound alerts backing up and lane changing definitely will keep me behind the wheel as I age. Handling at higher speeds is most reassuring and makes driving a pleasure. Possible Icy road sound alert was a little puzzling until I waded through the thick manual. Would be great if they just put a demonstration on YouTube for all the equipment loaded in this well thought out sedan."
"Swing....and a miss.  For the first few months, I was happy with my purchase...then I started noticing little things that made me wonder if I made the right decision.  One of my early concerns happened on the first rainy day that I needed to get something out of the trunk.  The design of the area around the trunk channels the water INTO the trunk when it's opened...think wet bags of groceries.  The more I used the car, the more I realized that some things were just dumb.  I'd start the car and back up, only to see that the backup camera cuts out after 5 seconds as the entertainment system boots up....the black screen lasts about 10 seconds.  Occasionally I won't be able to use the entertainment or navigation systems at all for about 2 minutes as it goes through its initialization.  Ever leave the radio volume turned up when you turn off the car?  Now, imagine not being able to turn it down the next morning until the system is good and ready to let you do that.  The safety system is questionable...is that a hill ahead?  Better sound the collision warning!  I've been pulled over by a State Trooper because the auto-high beams turned on as our cars passed each other.  (I don't use that feature any more.)  The Blue Link system is spotty at best.  The remote start seems to work fine during nice weather, but it fails about 50% of the time in the winter, when I really need it.    (This is NOT an exaggeration...I have the ""Remote start is not available at this time."" emails to prove that.)  The Blue Link features a great car locator, just the thing I want to be able to check that my daughter made it to the mall or to a friend's house.  However, it works only on the Mobile app...not from a browser...and, get this, the car has to be within a mile of your phone!  Useless, useless, useless.  I've had to take it to the dealer a couple of times because the front rotors became warped and one of the brakes units failed....both when the car has had less than 18000 miles.  Every day I detect a new rattle....in the door, behind the dash board, in the back seat.  I plan to get a new car in a couple of years and you can be sure that it won't be a Hyundai."
"Your feet will freeze in the winter  I have put very few miles on this vehicle in the last year.  Unable to drive long distances in the winter due to poor air flow to the floor board which is most uncomfortable during cold months. You can not have a comfortable ride in the winter with the climate control of this vehicle.   Service advisor at dealership had an attitude with me when I complained after they stated that it runs ""normal"".  Normal appears to be a real crappy heat system - beware if you live in a cold climate. There is also a blue glare from the dashboard that reflects into your side mirror making you think there are ""blue lights"" behind you.  I am very disappointed with the heat issue and have owned a Hyundai for 13 years.  Buying the extended warranty didn't help."
"A lot of car for the money!!  If you ae in the market for a quality mid-sized sedan, then this car should be at the top of the list.  I just purchased my Sonata yesterday, & I was pleasantly impressed.  The car, when I got in it, had a very good quality feel.  It didn't seem to be cheap, & the tech package was impressive.  But what blew me away is the way the car drove & handled.  After the test drive I hardly believed it was a 4 cyl car; @ 185 hrs pwr you have enough to get the job done - if you need more then of course you'll foot the bill for that, but I don't find it necessary unless you plan to go street racing.  The mix of fuel economy, elegant design, & appointments make this car really competitive against choices like the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Kia Optima, Nissan Maxima, etc., but checks in way below the belt pricewise of them all.  To me the this is the most bang for your buck."
"Hyundai Lease Problems/ Shady Business Practices  Consumers,I am reaching out to you pertaining to lease issues I am having with a 2015 Hyundai Sonata as it pertains to shady business practices by Hyundai. I wanted to bring various items to your attention in effort to help warn other consumers of what they could face when leasing or buying through any Hyundai dealership. Since I've leased my car back in October of 2014, I have had to have two tires replaced and a third tire now has two patches in it. I have had one windshield crack from something hitting it on an highway, and when I tried to get it replaced under a warranty sold to me by a dealership, they tried to void it by not allowing me to bring in my car soon enough for the warranty to cover it. By the time the dealership accepted my appointment, the crack spider-ed out, which voided the warranty. I had to e-mail Hyundai Consumer Affairs to get them involved. They ended up sending me $500 to cover the cost of my deductible to fix the repair. Currently, my car is at the dealership getting repaired because I am now facing problems with my second windshield as well as another major problem that I will talk about later. Overnight last week, the windshield cracked within the glass itself by the radio antenna. I believe it had to due with the sudden change between the hot and cold weather. When I contacted a person with Hyundai Consumer Affairs, he informed me today that Hyundai is ordering the glass for my car, but is only willing to pay half of the amount. The glass would cost $750 so they would cover $375 and they want me to cover the other half. The rep told me that his area manager looked at the pictures and said the glass isn't defective, but he couldn't provide the rep nor myself a reason as to why it's not defective. I told the rep that his manager needs to provide me with a proper and professional response as to why it's not defective and to inform his boss that I am not at fault for the glass cracking, and it's clear that it's defective. The rep looked at the pictures sent from the dealership and could tell it wasn't my fault as well as the dealer's manager. The rep also informed me that they have this same problem with windshields with other Hyundai models, but not the Sonata. I told him, that alone means it could happen to the Sonata if it's happening with other models. In addition, if the company did not feel that it wasn't defective nor were they at fault, then they wouldn't be offering to pay for half of the cost for the windshield repair. I told the rep to tell his boss that the company needs to cover the full cost of the defective glass as well as provide me with a better explanation other than, ""it's not defective."" Please also note, I did not give permission for Hyundai to order and replace the glass at a cost to me. It's something that they chose to do on their own terms. Furthermore, if they are wiling to cover up to $375 for the repair, then why can't I bring in an outside company like I did the first time and Hyundai pay for the repair? I don't understand why I'm being forced to go through Hyundai and for the windshield to cost $750. In addition, my Bluetooth system has gone out and I had to reset it twice for it to work. Also, the car was advertised to get 37 mpg on the highway and it only averages 27.7 mpg.Finally, the biggest problem I am facing and warning consumers is that my car has had several little misfires that have turned into bigger concerns. The little misfires cause the car to give a burst of acceleration while driving. However, the bigger concern is that when I have been stopped  in morning or rush-hour traffic coming off the highway or being on the highway, the car randomly shakes, revs up, and tries to accelerate while the car is stopped and the brake is applied. There has been no set pattern of occurrence. Every time this has happened and the car has been taken to a dealership, I get told that the dealership could not duplicate the situation and to bring it in if it does it again or as it's happening. I've contacted the BBB about all of this. They have sought out a manufacturing rep from Hyundai for mediation. The mediation has not taken place yet, but I was told by a BBB rep that the Hyundai rep said all that they will do is to honor my ""New Car"" Warranty, which protects the car up to 5 years and 60,000 miles. It's a basic warranty that you can get with the car and the company must honor if it's purchased. Hyundai is not offering to help me, except to honor a warranty that they must honor in the first place which does nothing for me in this case. The danger is what's happening with the car. It's life-threatening to myself as a driver, any passengers riding with me, as well as drivers around my vehicle. It seems to be that in order for Hyundai to take a costumers safety seriously, something dramatic must happen first. Otherwise, they offer no help nor support."
"Awesome car at a great price  Performance: I have the sport model which lets you change the way the car shifts into the next gear. On Eco mode it is a bit more slow to peak going UP a ramp to merge onto the highway. But I can just turn that off for 3 seconds and I am good to go. I can have 4 grown men (minimum of 175 lbs to a max of 225 lbs each) in the car and it still responds decently for the horsepower it has.  Fuel Economy: So I have been able to eek out 53 MPG by going 50 MPH in this car. otherwise by going 75 mph daily and still hitting city for 8 miles of my total 22 mile drive per day I still retain an impressive 35 MPG. I do not romp on the car nor do I aggressively brake or accelerate. This model was made to be comfortable and  provide some tech and have a decent amount of power with the price tag that it had. I have no idea why anyone would think it is supposed to blast off the line like a 300 hp car. It looks good, drives great, has LOTS of room. the head room is phenomenal. I tried out a 2017 lincoln mkz recently and it had no head room for a 5' 9"" guy. I was against the ceiling! The 15' sonata has at least 3.5 inches yet above my head in the front alone. also I have two 6' friends that have plenty of leg room in the back when I have the seat pushed all the way back. This car is friendly in button layout and design as well. Everything is sorta of one color for buttons with only a couple that are different ( like defroster LED and windshield LED). I can find everything I need to and there aren't multiple colors shooting at me with buttons that are too squeezed together.  I feel that as long as you can get the car for $21,000 and under you will have a awesome car that comes with lots of tech, great layout, great design, lots of room for family and groceries, and provide decent performance for what it is. If you want more horsepower then get the turbo. ALL cars that have turbos are more maintenance so don't think any brand is less work than the other. If you want even more performance then pay for it and take care of it. If you cannot do that, then don't buy more car than you need."
"unless you're looking for trouble stay clear  I purchased a new 2015 fully loaded Sonata 2.0 T. I was pretty happy with it until fuel injectors went bad when the car had less than 9000 miles on it. that caused spark plugs and coils go bad and finally catalytic converter! There are three things that bothers me about this car: ***1- Hyundai itself: they do not have ANY PARTs in stock, so the car had to sit in the dealership for almost a month only because parts weren't available or they had to order it and have it shipped or parts were on back order. ***2- after I showed my frustration and even mentioned word ""Lemon Law"" to the dealership after my car was sitting in the dealership for over 2 weeks, Hyundai North East general manager ""Pauletta"" called me and assured me that they were working on it and they would ship the parts as soon as they're available. she gave me her phone# and told me after my car was fixed she would call me and offer me gift cards or free service coupons. guess what?! I got my car back but I can't get a hold of Pauletta ever! I called her multiple times and left messages, no one answers the phone and my calls were never returned. ***3- Sonata 2.0 T: try to stay away from Hyundai Turbo cars, I talked to three mechanics and even the dealership guy himself told me that Hyundai Turbo cars are high maintenance cars....UPDATE ( a month later):Hyundai East region manager ""Pauletta"" just offered me a term of 10 years/120,000 miles Platinum extended warranty for all the frustration and the time that was spent over the repairs. I'm upgrading my two star rating to 4 star. they're clearly trying to take care of their customers. the only reason I'm not choosing 5 is because I'm still not happy with the reliability of the car, but if you have platinum extended warranty at no charge, then NO WORRIES!"
"Very good car, could be better!  I've had the car for a little longer than a year with almost 6,500 mi. It's my first Hyundai and I'm generally impressed with the overall build quality and performance of the car. Because of it's quietness and solid road feel, it makes a great trip car. The seat support is very good and the dash arrangement is logical which makes it easy to use while driving. The roomy back seat is comfortable for 3 adults and the oversized trunk is well laid out, great for grocery getting and large suit cases. A few miner complains though; (1) Exhaust note, needs to be refined, doesn't sound all that great. (2) Holds first gear a little too long when accelerating even in sport mode. Overall, I really do like the car. The outside styling is very nice and the ride is firm and takes most bumps and dips in the road with a secured refinement. I just couldn't give it a perfect 5 stars. Sorry, I'm picky!"
"Much like the cla-250 except done right  There is a lot to like about this car. The ECO borrows a lot from the Mercedes CLA 250 which I also own. E.g. the trunk lid design is almost the same.  I could trade in my benz for the ECO sonata,and probably not miss a thing.    Pros: well designed, well executed car,  a lot of common sense and standard options. 8 way automatic driver seat, quiet  drive. A lot of torque, available all the way from 1500 rpm to 5K RPM. Same torque and torque curve as the CLA. (198 foot pounds) . Good fuel economy,  takes regular gas.  The standard tires are Michelin Energy's now. Dual, scroll turbos, so no noticeable turbo lag.  Smooth and fast shifting 7 speed dual clutch auto tranny. Again, similar to the cla 250, except the Hyundai is faster and smoother shifting.   Nice standard telematics package with excellent iphone and android integration.  Cons: The turbo is not covered untder the 100K powertrain warranty. This may be a reason for folks who want to keep the car post the b2b warranty to stick with the 2.4L engine ( ie the non-eco sonata).  If the turbo goes, and you are out of warranty, it is an expensive repair.   The car perhaps a tiny bit underpowered. No spare tire.   More frequent oil changes  needed (5k vs 7.5K). The turbo engine is more finicky than the 2.4 inline 4 engine, so fully synthetic oil is highly recommended.    I wish the BSD side mirror was standard on the ECO.   The lumbar support is not hgt adjustable.   Service wise, Hyundai is trying to take a page from Mercedes, and bundle a long list of ""check this and inspect that"" with the oil changes, and charge you a ton of money.   Mercedes has alternating  A and B services, costing $200 and $400. (Effectively a glorified oil change. Looking at the service printout for the A service, they do not even bother to pretend they did anything other than changing the oil and the filter). Hyundai is trying to get you to have your service done at the dealer, and charge similar jacked up fees by bundling a long list of  super-overpriced  checks and inspections. They are trying to make it sound like they are doing all this work, to justify charging you a couple of 100 $ for an oil change.  E.g.: they will change your wiper blades for 3x what it would cost you to do it yourself.  If you buy into the concept, you can get some discount off their insanely priced maintenance.  They have a service leaflet, you may want to  peruse while you are at the dealer.   I do all my own maintenance, following the user's manual recommended service intervals and items, keeping detailed logs, and receipts.  Do not be intimidated by a salesperson telling you that they will not honor the warranty unless you opt into their maintenance racket.   By law they cannot force you to do your maintenance there.Update: I had a failed battery at 5K. The dealer service was total amateur hour. They admitted the battery was bad as they could see it draining down to nothing in 24 hours with no load on it. But they insisted the battery was fine, as their tester did not show a problem. Kept looking for a parasitic drain, despite of the fact that there was not one when monitoring the 2 battery terminals. They kept the car for a week, and wanted to give it back unfixed (no loaner)  but ended up replacing the battery in the end after I yelled at them.    2 things I dislike about the car: the jack point markers can not be seen unless you neel down and bend way down to look for them.  When need to change tires in the rain this is needlessly painful.     It is hard to get at the drain plug and oil filter. Have to remove a panel  with a bunch of bolts to get at them."
"Hyundai Used to be Awesome until 2010  I've owned 4 hyundais now. 1 2003 Accent, 1 2005 Elantra and 2 Sonatas (2010 and 2015).  The first car was a lemon that I bought in Fall River, MA... Empire Hyundai... and I had to fight with the dealership hard because it needed the same repair over and over again. I got an elantra as a substitute and that car was fantastic. No complaints. in between 2005 and 2010 i owned many used and mostly new cars. I decided to get back into Hyundai again so I got a base model sonata in Virginia. I should have never traded it in, it was great. Bought a Cadillac which was great but i was hitting 100k and driving 140 miles a day, the repairs were adding up. Went back to Fall River thinking that the same money hungry jerks weren't there, well they weren't... just a new set of them were.  Somehow, they managed to add an addition 5-10k to the loan, running me in circles because i was asking the same question ""I dont see the trade in value for the car"" to which they consistently answered me back saying, ""we paid the loan off, its here"" that wasn't my question. I called a lawyer and finally found that they added some charge that i would have NEVER agreed on if they had asked me if I wanted the service... some how they got away with it. They wanted me to go back to the dealership to talk about it, i said no, i didn't want to be taken advantage of for a third time in 1 month (i had gone back two days later and resigned paperwork for lesser service fees etc... stupid... i was stupid...). So i'm already sour because I hate this dealership but I love the car, its awesome, adaptive cruise control was worth it. The idea of driving 140 miles a day with ACC was like the highlight of my life. Up until a week ago. I'm trying to get on the highway, i sped up (its on a slight hill) and the car starts to jolt. I've seen this before, i've felt this before in my first hyundai, the accent. My heart drops. Here we go again. I press my foot down on the gas hoping it will just go away and stop jolting... no. 2 miles away from the next exit I'm shaking like crazy and get to a stop light. Turn the engine off and turn it back on... now its shaking worse and not only that i can barely accelerate. Ok good now we're going but we're still shaking and jolting every which direction. I some how make it to work even though some idiot in front of me is stopping in places they shouldnt stop in the road (because why not, that WOULD happen). 2 hours later I tell myself i'm not going to let this sit i'm going to go to the dealership. I call and make an appointment. OK be right there. Get in the car, turn it on in hopes the shaking is still there but not there at the same time ... the check engine light comes. good grief. the nav display asks if i need help i said heck yes please. i get connected to hyundai assistance and within 3 minutes into the call, the car engine shuts off but the battery is still going so i can communicate to the guy. I get towed away for free. What a monday. I get to the dealership around 5:30 after waiting for 3 hours for a tow. I'm tired, I haven't eaten and I just want to eat, go home and pass out. I get to the dealership and they say to me oh, the last shuttle left for the day but you can always call an uber. What is wrong with you? I just bought this car July 7th, 2015 and it only has 25k and you want ME to pay for an uber? I don't even know where the hell I am. I'm from southern MA not northwest of boston. He sends me to the waiting room. 20 minutes later, ""has anyone replied back to pick you up?"" i bite my tongue trying to be nice, ""no, i'm not from here, everyone is about 2-3 hours away"". ""oh."" yeah, oh. I walk out without anyone seeing me and go to chilis next door and vent. My friends come and pick me up and drop me off at home. I call the next day. ""Can I have a rental"" ""Well we can hook you up with a 55 dollar a day rental from enterprise"" ""look, I didnt cause this issue, I didn't get into an accident, I did not ask my engine to jump around like a Mexican Jumping Bean in the chassis... I am NOT paying for a rental and I am NOT paying to use uber. I already have a daily expense for a car and its sittng in your garage. why would I want a second one...??"" he said thats the best he can do. This started Monday, the call i just did happened tuesday. I didnt call Wednesday. I call yesterday asking for an update... well your cars engine is outside of the chassis, we asked for an overnight on the part we 'believe' will fix the problem but the part is back ordered nationally."" are you kidding me? he offers this rental again for 35 dollars I said i wasnt paying a dime. Not one single dime for a problem i didnt create. The only problem i created was involving myself with hyundai. i'll never EVER buy another hyundai as long as I live. Never. Unfortunately before of the jerks I bought this car from added additional debt, I'll never get myself out of negative equity. ever. There is no ETA. I'm disgusted."
"Dream car  I wanted a lime 68 as a kid but never could afford one. Now I am 50 and Ford not only brought back the color, but they made it look like what I wanted. I had been looking for a 68 or 69 in that color, which is impossible to find so I saw this 06 on the internet at my local dealer. One test drive made me realize that I didnt want an old one anymore. I got the looks coupled with power handling and a quality in the build that the 68 and 69 were lacking. So far I can't say enough good things about the car and hope to get a grabber orange to add to  the 89 convertible, 98 coupe and 06 GT that I have now.        "

Can't go wrong with the ECO  
"Mama is Happy so am I  I purposely did not buy the car with a turbo. Turbos require closer attention to oil changes and should be idled before shut down to cool the turbo before the car is turned off. This is my wifes car and all she wants to do is drive comfortably from point A to point B and not think about the car. This is the perfect car for her, stylish, comfortable, safe and easily controlled. Lots of room in the cabin for her students and all the books and paperwork she carries with her. Plenty of room in the trunk for trips to see the kids and grandkids and most important of all.... she is happy with the car. She has the Limited with the Ultimate package with the 2.4 L engine and 6 sped trans. I liked the car so much that I bought myself a 2016 Sonata Sport with the Tech package 2.4L with 6 speed trans. All I can say is I love my car also. Here we are almost a year later and I can report that we have continued to enjoy these great vehicles. There have been no problems with these dependable, great looking and fuel sipping vehicles."
Quality of leather seat is poor.  Bought a 2015 Sonata Sports in July 2015.  The driver's seat leather color is coming off.  It's turned grey and looks worn.  I have contacted Hyundai's consumer department and the dealership about the problem.  They say it's worn out from getting in and out of the vehicle. This is poor quality!!! They say they can't correct the problem. Why do I have a warranty if the problem can't be corrected?  I have had leather seats in other cars I owned and his has never occurred.  One car I had for 10 years and this never happened.  A vehicle's leather seats should not begin to deteriate within a year.  It's disappointing that Hyundai doesn't stand behind their products.  This is the first and last Hyundai I will purchase.
"Be prepared for issues if you buy the 2.0T  3 times in 3 years the turbo has caused issues. The first 2 times, the engine lost power due to the turbo failing. The 3rd time, the oil line from the engine to the turbo is leaking oil all over the place. We only have a little over 64,000 miles on this car and Hyundai will not cover the repair under their extended power train warranty."

"4 Hyundai/Kia products in 8 yrs with no regrets  First off, it's a Sport 2.0T Limited. No choice for that in the sub categories. For a time, the Unlimited Package was offered simply as the Sport Limited. I wasn't in the auto repair business for 30 years. Owned German cars. Reliability became questionable as time went on. 2008 Sonata traded with 115K with nothing other than normal maintenance. Still on the road with 240K+. Never left stranded. Took delivery of a new 2015 Sonata Sport 2.0T Limited March 2016. Love it. I'm 6ft 2, 200 lbs and have nerve damage in my legs from cancer/chemo. The most comfortable seats of any car I've owned. Drove 400 miles in 6 hours last week and could have kept going. 75+ mph, 90+ degree temps with the a/c on the whole time and some construction delays, I still averaged nearly 28mpg on that trip - and the car only has 2500 miles on it so the engine is still tight. Android Auto is great. I can dictate a text with the roof open at 70 mph and it works great. If you're buying a car in this price range for 0-60 times and not how it performs under ""normal"" driving, then you just need to get a Subaru WRX STi lol. Do you drive with your foot to the floor all day, every day ? No matter how fast your car is, there's always one faster. Ride is taught just how I like it. Brakes are great. Steering is ok for electric. That's my only gripe. Blind spot monitor, smart cruise control are great. I didn't rate reliability or dealer service. I took it in at 900 miles for an oil change. I maintain my cars MY way, which is usually better than the recommended service intervals. I bought it with the reliability of the current Kia and previous Sonata in mind and expect nothing less. THANKFULLY no CVT transmission.UPDATE 11/18/2016 - Going on 9 months and 9,000 miles. Downloaded the nav uodate with Apple CarPlay so can connect either phone now. Still feel the same way about this car and no regrets. My other half got a little new car envy and traded the 2012 Forte SX 5 door for a 2016 Forte5 EX loaded with Premium/Tech, and factory remote start. So now it's 4 Hyundai / Kia products and loving them.Update 5/18/1718,000 miles on the Sonata and 11,000 on the Forte5. Sonata averages 24mpg per tank with my heave right foot. Forte5 averages 32 per tank. Both still reliable as sunrise. Everyone that gets in the Sonata says the same thing: ""This is a Hyundai?"" My interior is back leather with orange piping and stitching. Do yourself a favor. Ignore preconceived notions about Hyundai/Kia and go drive one.UPDATE 11/20/2017.Closing in on the 2-year mark and 27,000 miles. The only issue to arise since my last update was a split air intake boot from the air filter box to the turbo inlet. Replaced under warranty. Also since the last update was a one-week, 3500m road trip from Dallas to Newport Beach, to Sedona, and back in June. Even with the taught suspension and low profile tires of the Sport 2.0T Limited, it was a fantastic trip. The dual zone climate control & cooled seats were  fantastic while sitting in 116 degrees in the Palm Springs traffic  Well that's what the car was reading anyway. I used the smart cruise control extensively and I have to say it worked fairly well. I was impressed. Slowing the car down, bringing it to a complete stop, and then resuming speed. Seats were downright comfortable. The only reasons we were really forced to stop for food, fuel, and bladders LOL. We are both in the six-foot-tall range and were extremely comfortable. Would not hesitate to do another road trip like that or longer with this car. Other than some short excursions around Newport Beach and Sedona, the trip average was a little over 30 miles per gallon. Not bad considering we were loaded down with our own luggage as well as a bunch of things for our friends. Some nice blasts through the mountains and across the desert of all three states. My particular one is Quartz White Pearl and black interior with orange piping and stitching. I think that interior is only available on the 2015 Sport models. Interior and exterior finish are still like day one. Even this far into owning the car, anyone that ever talks to me about it it's still astounded that it's a Hyundai.UPDATE 5/21/2018.Here I am again at 26 months and 33,500 miles. The only problem to report since the last update: Radio tuning button on the left side of the steering wheel stopped working in the Up direction. Replaced under warranty and all is well. Also hit the road with it again. Loaded with probably 4-500 pounds between the trunk and backseat, I drove 1,000 miles in 14 hours moving to Tucson a week ago. Still the best road trip vehicle."
Love this car!!!  Absolutely a great car in every way not only do I own a Hyundai Sonata but my sister just bought one and loves it
"Biggest regret in my life (car purchase)  I traded in my 2014 Sonata Limited 2.0 for a fully loaded 2015 Sonata Sport Ultimate 2.0 in January.  I have regretted this purchase within a week of purchasing this car.Pros:  solid acceleration, roomy, beautiful Orange color, fairly pricedCons:  the panaramic sunroof has rattled since the 3rd day of purchase, Hyundai isn't sure how to fix it. My Antenna had to be replaced due to my GPS not working properly and not my blue link app won't connect to my car.  The engine sounds like it is a diesel, it is loud and shakes violently from time to time, all of which I was told his normal.  They blame it on the high pressure fuel pump.  The road noise is louder then advertised.  Now my keyfob won't lock my car. I wanted to love this car, I really loved my 2014 but I wanted the Orange sport model."
"If you want a Missile...  What can I say about our Sonata?  Rocket!Though this vehicle has less horsepower than its former rendition, and its Kia Optima counterpart, this vehicle is nonetheless stunning.  The Hyundai Sonata has a more refined and mature look than the Optima.  Though they are essentially the same car, the Optima uses a larger Turbo Charger, and consequently gets worse fuel mileage.  But lets also be realistic in this department.  When you are purchasing the vehicle with the ""HOT"" engine you are really not interested in fuel economy, you're interested in HORSEPOWER.Nevertheless, the Sonata 2.0L Turbo puts out a fairly respectful 245 Horses.  With the electronic traction control, this powerplant slings this vehicle down the road pretty quick and will give you a fairly stout launch onto the highway.  Using the paddle shifters will give you that much more control over getting this sedan launched to Mars.  The power comes up very quick with the twin scroll turbo, there is almost no lag, as there is in the Optima.  This aspect gives the Sonata a slight edge in getting to the power band quicker, but it is limited by the smaller turbo.That said, the average driver will never know the difference.  What is more entertaining is picking on the Toyota Camry owners whom ""think"" their Camry Sport is a quick car.  Nope, its not.  I have smoked more Camry's and Accords than I care to mention here.  I throw respect to the Optima owners.  As for you Corolla S and Honda Civic Owners, YUMMY!The interior of this vehicle is very nicely laid-out and in my opinion, (and end reason for purchase), thought out better than the Kia Optima.  This is not to say the Optima is any lesser of a vehicle, it simply did not appeal to what I was looking for, so please don't read too much into that aspect.  This vehicle was designed and developed for sheer ""Bang for the Buck"", and regardless of the model you choose, you will find huge value in the options.  The suspension in the Sport models has been tuned and firmed up from the other renditions of this same car.  This vehicle is nearly silent at highway speeds, and rides so smooth, you really need to set the cruise control to avoid getting an invitation to Traffic School.  So keeping your eye on the Speedo is a must.The turn radius for this vehicle is quite tight.  I was expecting to have to do a stop and continue U-Turn in a couple of intersections near my home as they are fairly narrow.  Nope, this vehicle handled them without an issue.  This vehicle has been into Hyundai for the regular maintenance and for a factory recall on the Driver's Side Seat-Belt.  Other than that one issue, there has been no mechanical issues with this vehicle.  This vehicle has been wonderful, and we have no complaints with this car."

"Long term review (1year/14000 miles on vehicle)  We've owned this car and I wrote an initial review after looking at a mazda 3 and 6, ford taurus and a Genesis Sedan.After having this vehicle for over a year and being able to drive it daily and learn it's functions I can really say this car is a solid buy. Living in a freezer 7-8 months out of the year this thing has really performed with only very minor gripes about it and they really boil down to the way my kids treat this vehicle.EVERY function of the car still works with no broken knobs or funny noises and the car is still in ""one piece"". There is the normal wear and tear that any interior has but it's dealt with my family very well, with all aspects being able to hold up and stay clean. My 3 girls have a problem with keeping their feet off everything and as a result I have to constantly wipe down the interior and clean scuffs off the outside but these are things that life throws at you. Other than having the car serviced at regular intervals nothing mechanically has broken in the car to to have it repair and the dealer has always been courteous to us upon receiving the vehicle and we'll more than likely go through them when our lease is up to look into another vehicle. Gas mileage is still the same as when we bought it, with 27ish mpg's combined driving and premium fuel every time we fill. I have noticed the tires starting to split on the sidewall and will have this remedied through our dealer as it's covered under warranty.Overall if you're looking for a solid vehicle (even used) I'd look at one of these. Fully loaded you won't be disappointed as there are only a small number of models that supersede the Sonata within the brand."
"Still in love with my Sonata.  So I'm now 27 months into my 36 month lease and have zero complaints about my Sonata.The fuel economy is still excellent.  I've had the standard scheduled maintenance performed. I have had no mechanical issues.  There is a recall that was issued for the Parking Brake Switch.  However, prior to having the recall work performed, I did not have any issues or notice anything affecting the performance of my silver baby.One of the main reasons I leased the Sonata was because it was so roomy.  I often have 3 kids with me, my growing nieces and nephew.  They are all currently still in booster seats but fit easily in the back seat.  As they grow and age out of the boosters, there will still be room a plenty. However, with less than a year left, I'm starting to look at whether I'll keep it and buy the lease out, or move into the 2018 model.  It looks amazing and if it performs as well as my 2015 has, I'll be very happy. Hoping the remainder of my lease is as problem-free as it has been up to now. If anyone is considering the Sonata, I'd still highly recommend it."
"A Hyundai Hooner  After having many cars spanning many years (I'm a car junkie), I can say that I enjoy this Sonata.   PROS:The design is great.The ride is comfortable.The steering is smooth and effortless.The engine is quiet and moderately powerful.The HVAC performs flawlessly.It feels as though there is a stop-neutral feature (I personally like this, but one has to remember to give the pc a second to engage before throttling).The engine idles smoothly and the transmission shifts perfectly (despite the fact that it has an electronic throttle module (and likely a TCM elsewhere) placed right at the front of the engine for all of the radiant radiator heat to blow on it, will see how that device holds up over time).Tire and rim sizes are perfect (that doesn't always happen).The interior visibility is good with the exception of the rear window (I use blind spot mirrors so I don't look back there nor do I turn my head to look out windows when lane changing, it isn't necessary).When braking, I really enjoy that the transmission gears down, finally creeping up to a stop, I have had to only put forth minimal effort when braking. CONS:I have only had the car a very short time so my input is biased (I love this new car) and questionable and any rating regarding reliability isn't valid.I can't say enough how much I hate plastic components bolted onto a hot metal engine, that said, I dislike the plastic intake manifold.The Electronic Throttle Module is located at the front of the engine, uncovered, unprotected from radiant heat and water/particles from the grill (I had a Volvo and plenty of Fords with that darned ETM...There is body roll when cornering, but that is to be expected with most mid-class mid-size sedans.Update 8.26.2016: I recently had the the P200A trouble code and as expected the VCMA motor failed. I was hoping it was only the motor and not the butterflies inside the intake. I am glad it was an easy fix this time, under warranty. I suspect that the next time this little problem arises, the intake will need to be removed.  Still a good car, but almost got me killed when it went into limp mode without any CEL present. I miss the days of metal intakes and well engineered components...  I think, just because,of some small comms issues that tend to,present themselves, I am going to get some ferrite and start ensuring that no rogue frequencies affect other electronics in the bay.Update 02/2018: Still a great vehicle!"
"Do not buy this car  I had a 2006 Hyundai Sonata which was a great car, so I bought another Sonata.  It's nowhere near as comfortable.  The front seats are extremely uncomfortable because of a seam that presses into the back of the legs, sides that angle up (fine if you're VERY, VERY skinny) and is deeper than is comfortable from front to back.  The design of the seats also make it more difficult to get in and out of the car.  The rear of the car slants down which makes it ""sexier"" looking, but is impractical.  The trunk is large, but because of the slant of the rear window, the opening for the trunk makes it difficult to get anything of size into it.  The rear seats fold down, but the release to fold them is in the trunk instead of the back window ledge - a very inconvenient feature.  The steering wheel is smaller than a standard size which made it hard to find a cover for it (needed for hot summers).  The steering wheel also has controls so The Club doesn't fit easily.   It does NOT have a spare tire - just a ""fix-a-flat"" kit which is worthless for a blow-out.  When the ignition is turned off, all 4 doors unlock which I consider very dangerous.  It's difficult to put on and take off the front seat belts because the latch is very low between the seat and the console.  I'm sorry I bought the car."
"14,000 miles of smooth, quiet trouble free driving  Love this car. Smooth, quiet, tons of room, great gas mileage, not one problem with anything. Package with back up camera, XM, power driver's seat, automatic headlights and the homelink auto dimming mirror made the base model a great commuter and road trip car. With very little effort I can get 40+ mpg on the highway and for a car this size that's amazing. The only thing I don't like is the buzz of GDI engine when it's cold and no spare tire included (I bought one with the jack for $200). $21,500 out the door with 0% financing made it the perfect new car."
"22,000 miles of smooth, quiet trouble free driving  Love this car. Smooth, quiet, tons of room, great gas mileage, not one problem with anything.

Update at 30K still runs and drives great and fuel efficiency, especially on the highway, is outstanding. The initial cost was lower and unfortunately the depreciation has been greater than I would like.  Just passed 36K no problems other than a little oil usage - I'll monitor"
Poor design  You have to remove 14 bolts to remove the splash guard under the car to change the oil. It took me 1-1/2 hour to change the oil that would normally takes 20 minutes. Hyundai did not give me a satisfactory answer when I suggested to add a trap door under drain plug and filter for easy access. I would have purchased a Camry for the same amount had I known this.
"A lot of good, a little bad  I put about 40,000 miles on a 2013 Altima before trading for this as an end-of-model year. I also tested a 2015 Fusion and Malibu along the way, as well as a 2014 demo Cadillac CTS V-Sport.  The good news on the Hyundai is that the acceleration seems much better than most professional reviewers give it credit for.  It is much quicker than the Altima 2.5 was, and that stop-light bobble (lugging from the CVT) just isn't there.  The car is roomy, more so than a Fusion and much more so than the Malibu, though the Altima gets the edge for better long-drive seat comfort.  The Hyundai looks very sharp (possibly losing in this segment only to the Fusion), and everyone who has been in it noted the quality of the materials (better than the Altima and Fusion, though maybe less than a top-of-the-line but pricier Accord).  The dash lines are clean; they will never be mistaken for the sheer elegance of a Jaguar XF, but are much less distracting than the chromed plastic so abundant in the Caddy.  It has memory seats, for which you would need to drop $40K on the Platinum version of a Murano or Maxima to get from anything in the Nissan line.  The 16 Altimas have 12 way power seats, but no memory... I'd be tweaking for a week every time my wife drove it !!   Hyundai also ties the side mirrors into the memory, so you push one button and life goes back to where it should be.  The car tracks very straight, though in all honesty, it took about three times behind the wheel to get the feel of it.  Drive it, get out and walk around, and drive it again to see what I mean.  It's almost like the car has to get used to you, rather than the other way around.  The D-steering wheel looks sharp, but is not real smooth when used in daily life.  The heated & ventilated front seats work very well and hold snugly during corners.  The heated back seats are a really nice touch.    The back-up camera locates objects precisely, and follows the curve of the steering wheel (cough, Altima don't, cough).  The display is mounted high enough to make for much easier viewing than most competitors, though the back-up sensors will ping the crown of the road when you back out of an angled driveway.  The driver protection (lane drift and collision warning) work well, and less intrusively than the Cadillac CTS.  I'm personally not found of the concept.. all we need is another toy to make drivers lazier, but it does work.  The bad lies mostly in the electronics suite.  You have one button to cycle through the climate control settings, so you have to look over and push the button several times if you had to run the defroster.  I will note the HVAC system works really well; it's just the control that's lacking.  The Sonata links quickly to your phone, but Altima would read texts to you and let the other end know you were driving.  If you can do that in the Hyundai, I haven't figured out how.  The most serious gripe is (and the Edmunds guys and the Hyundai salesmen kind of gloss over this) is that you have to subscribe to the Hyundai service and use a smart phone to be able to use the remote car start.  This is beyond stupid... may all you app-lovers be rendered impotent by your dad-gummed toys !  GIVE ME A BUTTON ON THE FOB like any normal car.  The nav system, on the other hand, is excellent, with a large display and actually shows the speed limit of 95% of the roads... it even detects school zones.  The sound system is surprisingly bland for an Infinity unit, though I'm still tweaking the settings.  I've driven in light rain with no issues, but no other weather I can report on.  My general opinion is that the car is superior dollar-for-dollar to the Altima and the Malibu, and that you could probably get a slightly better Fusion or Accord, but you'd be laying out quite a bit more cash.  If they fix the electronics, this would be a great car.  Option you should get that I didn't- heated steering wheel, though the HVAC system is quick to remedy the cold."
"15,000 Mile Review  I've had this car for about 8 months, 15,000 miles, and not a single problem. It is very comfortable, there's minimal road noise, and highway fuel economy is great. It's been very reliable thus far, only needing routine maintenance. We also have a 2015 Toyota Camry in the family, and this vehicle trounces the Camry in nearly every way. The interior materials are better, the ride is better, MUCH less road noise, etc. The push button start, proximity key, automatic climate control, heated seats, etc. in a sub $25,000 car is a phenomenal value. I'm still enjoying my Sonata as much as I did the day I drove it home. Go check it out!"
"Still a great ride  This is by far the best car I've ever owned. A year and 18,000 miles on the odometer later, no rattles or any problems with workmanship. I drive through mountains on the interstate every day to work (60 miles round trip). The car handles extremely well and I'm getting 25-27 mpg in town and 29-31 mpg on the highway. Since its cheaper now I use high test gas (I heard the turbo likes it better). Ignore the reviews saying this car is sluggish; it isn't. The car is a bit slow on the front end but it has plenty of power. For freeway driving it can pull ahead in traffic with ease. I recently took it through the Cascade Mountains on a road trip and it breezed through every curve effortlessly.I am over 6 feet tall and this car is comfortable for me to drive. If you want adults to be comfortable in the back seat this car has spacious back seats and works better than most sedans. . The blind spot warning already has prevented an accident or two.* Love the backup camera; the lane departure system is annoying but I leave in on for safety.* My grand children love the pull-down shades in back.* The car handles quite well. I never use the paddle shifters but do switch between eco, regular and sport driving modes. Sport seems to do better in the rain but cuts down on gas. I use eco around town.* I wish the car had fog lights. While the LED lights look cool they do not help with visibility. * Navigation works well and the car stereo is excellent. Between Pandora and XM radio my commute is much more interesting though I do wish the steering wheel had a radio mute button (or maybe I just have not found it). I also wish the car had AWD.* My biggest complaint is the automatic trunk opener. You can stand behind in with your keys in your hand for minutes and nothing happens. Then you casually walk by and the stupid thing opens.Still love the car. I have been watching and these 2015s have good deals right now. Wait until the end of the month for better deals. Negotiate ruthlessly and don't worry about the color. And don't be fooled by the addition of the stolen car service (a waste of money - your auto insurance likely covers it)"

Don't let the looks fool you!  Hyundai Bluelink service is horrible. Works sometimes and alerts you when you have a issue. But does not elaborate on the issue. Customer service is horrendous. The dealerships service departments are terrible at least here in NYC. My friend started having issues with his 2015 sonata at 2500 miles. My check engine light started at just under 5500 miles. TPMS issues as well. Going off for no reason. The sunroof creaks and rattles. The leather is nice until a few months later and I always clean and moisturize with meguires wipes. Rearview camera doesn't always kick in. I can go on and on but I think whomever is reading this got the point.Update as of 6/2/2016 Mileage is 16k. So after multiple recalls the car runs worse than ever. Sunroof has been done multiple times and still makes noise on uneven pavement. And to top it off car stalls randomly because of the torque converter and the dealer refuses to admit issue. Intake runners making noise but since I have no check engine light refuse to fix it. And now the drivers side control arm is making noise as well. This by far is the worst car I have ever owned and will most likely be filing against Hyundai under the lemon law.
"Over 19 months of use and still fun to drive.  The car never stops my amazement in how little gas it uses.  There are two week points that I have addressed.  The factory tires are JUNK.... replaced with Pirelli P7. The car wanted to wonder (left & right) on all roads with any crown or grove.  This was fixed with a bolt on strut tower brace that cost about $200 and is a simple 5 min installation.  With those two changes the car went from OK to VERY GOOD.   When you take a test drive make sure it is long enough with various road surface and speeds, as these items may not be a bother to you.   One other item is road noise,  it  is much louder then a Chevy Malibu and many other new cars today.  This maybe the best all around car I have ever had."
"Sonata 2015 Eco! Nice car.  I just bought mine maybe 2 weeks ago! This is my 3rd Hyundai. Very happy with the brand. It's a midsize car, roomy interior, with the gas mileage of a compact car. Awesome! They give you alot for a base model. The only thing I did not like is the stereo. It's VERY LOW wattage and low sound. I didn't realize that other models had an upgraded sound system. Disappointing, since I like loud sound and bass! Other than that, I'm happy!"
"EPA inaccurate  My car is suppose to get 23/32 MPG but no matter how I drive, Eco, Normal or Sport, baby driving...coasting to red lights in city and doing 75 hwy, I consistently come in 4 MPG less both city & hwy.  I have tested the computer read by the old fashioned way of spending down the fuel and then filling back up, tracking the mileage.  I have done Octane additives at the suggestion of the Hyundai service advisor.  I took in to get the car's computer system checked.  They just want to blow it off as did the Hyundai America customer service.  When I read reviews on the Turbo 2.0 Sport limited, I see every so often drivers mentioning their mileage at what I am suppose to get yet am not. I figure at $2.50 per gallon this will cost me about $300 a year!  Not happy and not done complaining. Now, for the rest of the car, it is awesome for the money.  I have used numerous times all the tech stuff on this Ultimate package that comes on the Sport Turbo limited.  Very impressive.  I hear complaints on the pick up but I am telling you that if you throw into tiptronic, you will fly!  The smart car technology on cruise is awesome, cross traffic control is incredible, back up cam with sonar, excellent, BSD and BSD oncoming warning is spot on, forward crash avoidance works like advertised!"
"Want to Love it.  I purchased the Sonata Eco with the tech package.  I am a 6'4"" tall and weight around 240.  I purchased this car because I felt the vehicle fit me well and was built with quality.   I have owned the car for about 6 months and have liked it but not loved it.  My main complaint is with the driver seat.  I am still not comfortable in the seat, though it is getting better.  When I drive it for an extended period (up to a 1/2 hour) I get out with upper back pain.  This has been very frustrating.   I have loved MPG I am getting with the vehicle.   If I have the vehicle in ECO mode and drive conservatively I can get 40 mpg on the freeway.  I purchased the vehicle for around 24K the price dropped to around 23K a couple of months after I purchased it."
"Love Hyundai  This is my second Sonata and third Hyundai. I liked my 06 Sonata but traded up for a a 10 Tucson. The ride quality of the 06 Sonata waso much better than the 10 Tucson. I'm a 38 year old male and decided I needed a vehicle with better ride quality, but I never expected the 15 Sonata to ride as well as it does. I love this vehicle.  My ex had a 12 bmw 328 xi and I can only feel the difference of steering in drive/ride quality from his Beemer to my 15 Sonata Limited. Hyundai has really leaped forward! Very impressed!"
"Gas Gauge Calibration Problems 2015 Sonata Limited  I just purchased the car last week.  When the dealer gave me the car it was suppose to be full tank and the digital gas indicator showed about little above 3/4 full.  So salesman and I drove down to the nearest gas station to fill it up to full tank as that was the dealer's policy.  But, when the salesman tried to make it full tank the pump would turn off, even though gas gauge showed it was not.  We thought it might have been the pump at the gas station.  But, after purchasing the vehicle and filling it up at another gas station, I came across the same problem, the pump would shut off even though it was not full tank.  I did some searches online and it seems this is an issues, see link: http://www.hyundai-forums.com/lf-2015-sonata-i45/306826-gas-gauge-calibration-2015-sonata-ltd.html Other than this issue, the vehicle as been good."
"A year later, fantastic car  It's been almost three years since I bought a new 2015 Sonata Limited 2.0T. Hyundai moved from the Sport 2.0 with the Ultimate package to the Limited 2.0T. Not sure of the difference between the two but both have a lot of features, and my Hyundai dealer said not a lot of that particular trim were manufactured. The Limited 2.0T I bought has the turbo paired with a four-cylinder engine (245 hp), leather, heated and cooled seats, panoramic sunroof, navigation, great sound system and a bunch of safety features, including rearview backup camera, smart cruise (which works great and I use all the time on the highway), blind spot warning (which has saved me from a few possible collisions), lane departure warning and a cool brake hold button that in stopped traffic lets you keep it in drive and take your foot off the gas pedal. I traded in a 2009 Sonata Limited V6 (which never had any problems – just did the regular maintenance and drove it to 108,000 miles before trading in and got another 100,000-mile Hyundai warranty). I test drove a lot of cars and SUVs and narrowed my final list down to the Sonata, Ford Fusion with turbo and AWD and the Suburu Legacy V6 with AWD. I have a 50-mile roundtrip commute on highways through the Cascade Mountains in rainy Washington State. I really wanted AWD because of the weather here but the Fusion and Legacy dealerships simply would not negotiate much of a deal with me. Also, the Sonata Limited 2.0T included many more features and, three years later, the build quality appears really good. I just put good Michelin all-season tires on the car, which is front-wheel drive,  and it handles great in the rain and light snow.The only thing that has broken is the steering wheel switch for radio but that likely is from overuse and the dealer replaced it free of charge. When I bought the car, I was able to negotiate with several Hyundai dealerships and get good deals on both a substantially discounted new 2015 Sonata and above-Edmunds price on my trade-in. (Note in negotiating: get pre-approved for a loan then make dealerships compete on the price of the car; don’t get too picky on a color as that reduces your ability to negotiate.) I made three different dealerships compete – via phone and email (stay out of the dealerships in person after you have found the car you want) – on a price and worked the last one down another $1,000 from a price with incentives already $7,000 below MSRP. Then in the finance office I told them I was pre-approved and they actually got a loan via Hyundai at an even lower rate than my already very low rate). I love Hyundai’s long warranties but watch out for dealer options in the dealership finance office. Why do you need any extended warranties when the regular one is so good? One dealer option in particular, a high-tech service to track your car if stolen, is sometimes included in your contract. It sometimes is as high as $750 or $1,000! They told me it would lower my car insurance. Check with your auto insurance (my auto insurance covers my cars if stolen – no need for it).  So far I love the Sonata. The steering is much, much better than my 2009 Sonata. It has three driving modes: Sport, Regular and Eco. The car gets a little sporty in Sport. Eco is for saving gas. I drive mostly in the Regular setting. I liked the extra power of my V6 so was attracted to the turbo, which appears to be a very good engine with some notable differences. The V6 engine really was pretty fast, and could take off quickly.  The turbo is not at all in the class of a V6 in starting out from a stop but in the mid-range speeds pulls very well, which is what I was interested in anyway in highway driving. I am still getting about 31 mpg highway and about 26 to 27 combined, better than my V6.  The cabin is large. I am 6 feet 2 inches tall and weigh 260 pounds and am very comfortable (the front seats lower). The back seats are larger than most midsize sedans; two adults can ride comfortably there. Pull-down sunscreens for the back seats have been a huge hit with kids trying to take a nap. The navigation system is good. Very few beefs: the trunk is large but the trunk opening is narrow; I wish the audio/radio had a mute and visibility is slightly obscured to the rear but the rearview camera helps with that. I don’t like the flashy chrome along the sides (tacky) but like the overall slightly Genesis look much better than the fluidic sculpture design of the previous model. The car is comfortable; three years later still very quiet, no rattles or squeaks and so far very enjoyable, with no problems. It does not have AWD and does not drive as well as the Fusion (though much better than the Legacy) but I overall am very happy with my purchase. Just make sure to do the basic maintenance. It can cost a few hundred a pop but helps the car in the long run. Because of the turbo I always use premium gas, which I believe has helped with the mpg."
"Still think it's a good value  This car is all around a great buy so far, the Mpg is excellent I am averaging 34.5.  On an all interstate drive I averaged over 38. The ride is pretty descent,  road noise is average, radio sounds good,  touch screen responds well,  phone Bluetooth was easy and works great,  instrument cluster has all the features you need then some and looks good. The interior is roomy,  I am 6'3"" 230 lbs and have plenty of room anywhere in the car. The trunk has plenty of space,  the rear access seats are easy to open and close. Blu link feature works well, I schedule a service that the self monitoring system recommended. The only draw back I have is that I change my own oil and there is a cover blocking access to the oil plug and oil filter and no access door to them so you have to take out all the screws and remove the cover to access the plug and filter. Update all previous thoughts and opinions still apply , I have had to bring it to the dealership twice once for a recall and once for a side mirror not working ,both where handled quickly and no cost to me."
"Great value!  My first experience with a Hyundai. And over all,I have been impressed! I have the Sport model with Premium package. Coming from an Accord,I was a little skeptical. But I liked the styling and interior. Classy looking exterior. The interior,is very well laid out. Functional with easy to use controls. I love the digital odometer. The dual auto temp AC works great. The back up camera works very well,with a surprisingly clear picture. The radio and speakers are adequate.Quality look and feel to the materials. The leather Sport seats have cloth inserts,so you don't get burned in summer heat. I have a sensitive back,and with the side bolsters,and power adjustments,including lumbar,I am very comfortable. The car is very quiet.  The engine is very smooth running. Transmission shifts are not felt. I do hear, a slight road coarness,from the performance tires. I have been surprised at how roomy the car is. It is EPA classified as a large car,with 122 cubic feet of interior space. That is the same as a Chrysler 300. Only without the bulky exterior. It has a big 16.3 cubic foot trunk. With a very large pass thru opening. Which comes in handy,when carrying a big item. And it has dual struts for the hood! A rarity in cars today.Only a few minor complaints. I am so far only getting 26 MPG in mixed driving,in the ECO mode. I am hoping that will improve,with a little more mileage.The cup holders,in the console,do not have a gripping device to hold the drink in place. And the cup holder in the doors,is only big enough for a slim bottle or can. They could have made the touch screen bigger than 5"". I don't see why they did not include the data system in the radio. Overall for the money and long term warranty,you can't beat the 2015 Sonata. I have had the car for over a year now,and nothing wrong! Really amazing!I only brought it in for oil changes and tire rotations!"

"You will get to know the service department people  I had a 2009 Sonata, and a 2012 Sonata, with no problems. I never had them back for any warranty work. This is not the case with the 2015 Sonata.  I have had the car for just 1 year, and have been back for warranty work 8 times now.  It is the Last Hyundai I will ever own. Had it back 3 times to fix the rear window defogger switch. Twice for the right front brake caliper recall.  How can  it be that Hyundai does not have the part in stock for a recall item.  Service manager told me they can not order the caliper until they are sure I needed one.  If that is truly Hyundai's policy on a recall item, then I don't want any more Hyundai's.  I had the car back three times to get the front passenger seat belt fixed, and it is broken again. As far as the gas mileage, I get about the same as I did with the 2012 Sonata, even though the 2015 is suppose to be 2 MPG better.  Acceleration is not as good as the 2012 had. The ride and comfort level is good, a little better then the 2012 had. Last time I will buy a first year redesigned model."
"Better than I Could Have Imagined!!!  ***UPDATE 8/7/2017***I'd like to make this review brief as possible, but I know that's not going to happen.I am so blown away by this vehicle that I tell everyone who comments on it that it's now not just the best car I've ever owned, it's the only car to get in my mind(regarding the options/performance/warranty/reliability you get for the money). If you want to drop $70k on a vehicle with the same options and a little more pep, more power to you(literally). I own a Sonata Ltd with the Ultimate Package, and after driving in the high end Infinity/Audi/BMW, this vehicle is just as comparable in regards to the luxurious feel and amenities. From the Xenon headlights, LED running lights and LED interior lights(so crisp), to the LED taillights, to the sophisticated new styling, this car is the epitome of high class without the high class cost.The smart cruise, which is one of my favorite features, works beautifully and I use it frequently when on a long commute. Also, have you ever been trying to follow a friend or family member on the highway or interstate for a long commute and can't seem to get your cruise control set just right and either slowly gain or lose distance between them? Problem solved! With the smart cruise I just set my cruise speed for higher than I know the car in front of me will go, and simply stay behind them. If they slow, the car slows. If they speed up, the car speeds up. Even better, I can choose if I want to be a car length behind them or a few car lengths behind them. I have not tested it in city traffic, as I do not live in a big enough city, but I could see how it would come in handy(strike that, become a valued asset and seen as a necessity) when in slow moving or quick stop and go traffic. The Xenon headlights and LED taillights are truly remarkable in both functionality and in style. My wife told me she had to drive the vehicle so I could see the lights from the outside, and I was more than impressed. When seeing this vehicle traveling down the road at night you expect to see a familiar luxury emblem on the front, not the ever increasingly popular ""H"". I currently have my phone hooked up with the ""Android Auto"", and also have the BlueLink and Bluetooth set up on the car and all flawlessly perform as they should. I was impressed with all of those ""little features"" that the Android Auto provides and couldn't be happier with that addition. My only complaint, which can't be stuck on just the Sonata, is the visibility. My previous vehicle was a Navigator, and comparatively the visibility felt like it was cut in half. With that said, in all cars visibility has been cut down the same, so again this isn't just Hyundai. One positive note is that the blind spot works beautifully and it has saved me from cutting into a car on multiple occasions. On a side note, the blind spot has an ability to judge the speed of the car behind you, so if said vehicle is coming up really fast the blind spot will adjust to warn you earlier, as opposed to other blind spot systems that simply warn you once the vehicle trips the sensor.I suppose the only real downfall are the leather seats. They are premium leather, but not as soft as the napa leather that I've enjoyed in the past. That being said, it seems like these seats are more durable and will hold up better. Additionally, the heated and cooled seats work beautifully, and I've gotten multiple comments on the heated seats in the back.Alright, I could continue on and on about this car, but it feels like I'm just going through the options package and commenting on how great it is, so you could just look at the package and know that all of it is exceptional. I purchased the extended warranty that covers bumper to bumper, excluding bumpers :-), for 10 years/100,000 miles, which I would suggest wholly to anyone considering this vehicle."
"Gotta have it, Gotta love it (An honest review)  UPDATE: At around, 23000 miles, my transmission started acting up, it seemed like it was having difficulty shifting from 3rd to 4th gear and vice versa. Shortly, my check engine light came on as well. I took it to the dealer where they had to replace intake manifold and VCM (Variable Cam or something). Not impressed with Hyundai anymore if it gives me problem at only 23k miles, and yes I have always kept it maintained. Like many others here, I rented a bunch of cars before finally buying this Sonata, believe me it's worth it. I rented a Camry, Altima and finally a Sonata, I was in a huge dilemma about buying a Nissan Altima or a Hyundai Sonata until the Nissan dealership in Lake Norman started playing tricks on me, and after 2 months of research and rental experiences, I finally decided to for a Venetian Red 2015 Sonata SE. I wanted a base model with alloy wheels and Bluetooth without having to pay for them, and guess what, the LED lights and the spoiler just came in as an added bonus for Sonata, this is the beauty of Hyundai along with its amazing 100,000 miles warranty that you do not have to pay extra for a ridiculous package in order to get basic stuff such as alloy wheel etc, like in the cases of Toyota, Honda and Nissan. Alright, let me be honest and tell you a few things that I dislike about this car: - Gas Mileage (Hyundai claims it gives you  25 mpg in the city, which is not true, I get not more than 23 mpg in the city for sure)- Traction Control (The traction cannot handle the acceleration and the wheels would start spinning, even on the dry roads, not sure what to blame)- USB port - The built in USB port does not support android, at least not in my case, therefore I have to rely on Bluetooth or AUX)- Dull Alloy Wheels - The dullness of alloy wheels for the SE trim does not compliment the car over all, but eh, I can't complain much as it is a BASE modelNow, the things I absolutely love about this car:- Great Turn Radius- Beautiful LED lights (even with base model)- Highway mileage (35 mpg even driving at 75 miles an hour, you might get better than 37 mpg if you drive at 55 miles an hour)- Spacious trunk - Great leg room for rear seats- Just enough power to accelerate quickly and merge on to the highways/freeways- Amazing Brakes- Sports, ECO and Normal Mode (For those who do not know, once switched to SPORTS mode, the car's steering becomes stiff as well as the engine along with the help of transmission helps you accelerate the car faster, you actually feel like driving a sports car. Normal mode for regular driving I guess)- Eye Catching Front - I love the way it looks in the front, not a big fan of how they have changed the rear- Warranty - 36,000 for Radio, Media and speakers. 60,000, bumper to bumper and 100,000 for Engine and Transmission. I do not think any other automobile manufacturer can beat that.Punch Line: An absolutely wonderful package for those who would like to fall in love with their new ride."
Endures well! Great value for longevity  Reliable car. Trusted and rode for over a decade. The brakes are not very sensitive though. And the radio/CD compartment has had issues the last few years though. The door handles' paint also wear off. It was a manufacturer error for this model.
"Ageless Looking & Sporty  The one thing all buyers should be aware of and this goes for many cars from 1995 to 2008 is that many, even Acura used timing belts.  Many of these cars engines are Interference engines which means extremely close tolerances.  So, if the timing belt breaks (It will give no warning) , most likely it will destroy your engine.  If the engine is non-interference (many 1995 to 2000 were) it means your walking and need to get your car towed, and looking at a $700 repair to reinstall the belt.  So, if you are intent to buy one and don't know if that belt was replace, then you must replace it soon or gamble on losing your engine.  The 2002 V-6 Sonata I bought looked almost brand new in and out , underneath and even the engine bay.  (I know dealers clean them, but the car was well pampered.) I paid a bit more but this car was outstanding.  Not one ding on the car, no accidents , EC interior, and only one very small minor scratch (about an inch ) on the bumper.  Pearl White.  I did own a 2002 4 cyl long ago and I never had a problem with it.  I also own a 2013 Elantra Limited and like that as well. I know it's early in the process but I put about 550 miles on it so far, and no complaints and very happy.  There is a lot of junk out there in that price range.  I had Toyota's and they are wonderful reliable cars and would have bought another had the price been right.  Anyway, In its present condition it hard to think there will be problems popping up soon, but then again, its relatively new and it is a 14 year old car, but I can tell somethings were replace like the A/C , and front brakes etc.  I wrench on cars so I can do somethings when they do come up.  I would say the idle is not the smoothest but once in drive it is pretty quiet and a very comfortable soft ride. Quiet in park as well.  Tires look almost new, and exhaust doesn't seem that old, so it's relatively quiet, accept upon acceleration.  It emits a growl, which sounds kinda like dual exhaust so its not too troubling.  No it's not as quiet as my new car on acceleration but hey, it is 14 years old.   Power is decent at 170 HP. Handling is good, and visibility is real good.  Brakes are firm.   Everything works well, including Power sunroof.  Dash looks brand new , and its beige in color.  I can tell this car spent a lot of time in the garage and not in the sun.  Paint shines! I saw many articles on the rear brakes and how they made lock up.  Yes, I think the design was bad.  I did take the rear wheels off, and I believe the problem is the metal slide clips they use are a bad design.  I sanded down those slides, and also the edge of the pads, and used high temp grease to ensure movement.   I just want to avoid possible problems since it seems this was a concern.    It's not hard to do this."
Horrible  This car was honestly the worst thing I could have purchased. I spent a lot of money just to buy it and then ended up having to spend thousands of dollars to fix it the next week after purchase. Although gas mileage was great I would rather have something that would burn through gas then this. It was not reliable and had a mind of its own.
"Excellent value when new, even better as preowned  I bought my 2002 Hyundai Sonata new, driving 100 miles from my home to the dealer who had the color and options I wanted. Overall, this car has been excellent. It now has 190,000 miles on it and I can honestly say the problems that I have had have been minimal. Those issues include a bad oxygen sensor, a power steering leak and the starter replaced, all of these things after 120,000 miles. I will admit that I have not been as maintenance conscious as I should have been, but despite that, she continues to run like a champ."
"RUN don't walk!!!  We bought this car second hand from an owner who did maintain the car and brought it in for all recalls. We have owned it for 4yrs and have only put on 20,000km's. Within the first year of having it, wheel bearings needed to be changed. Then it started to spudder, shorted out and died in the driveway. Turns out there is a problem with the battery connectors and one had almost completely rotted off. I have heard of this issue with these cars. During this escapade it blew the main fuse of the car which was hard to find. Now the transmission is finished, the catalytic converter(S) need to be changed, yes there are 3 on this car and it will cost you 2000+ to change them, there is electrical"
"Best car I've owned in my 39 years!  I bought one for $10,000 w/29k miles. I wrecked it at 142k miles. At 40mph, I T-boned an SUV, and it still started, but Esurance totaled it.:(The water pump died at around 80k, covered. Between 100k & 142k, I replaced the front wheel bearings in 2011 (I drove offroad a few times), battery, alternator, rear brake calipers. That's it, nothing else major went wrong. Minor things the past year or two, tape deck died, radio display flickers (I have Sirius, so that doesn't matter), antenna only goes half-way up."
"Not such a good car  This wasn't my car, it was my mom's and I hated driving it.Parts would wear out constantly.At about 80k miles driving to work, the timing belt snapped and destroyed some critical engine parts.The engine had to be torn apart and rebuilt, along with a new water pump costing almost $1200.Later on that year, the water pump had to be replaced again, the CV joints had to be replaced, new alternator, and new spark plugs all before 90K miles.Once it passes 100K miles, we got all sorts of weird noises such as a shrieking engine that is the worst when driving in the rain.The ride was very uncomfortable with almost no padding in the seats."
"Matter of the Heart  I was the proud owner of the first '65
Fastback Mustang in San Bernardino
county in 1965.  Said car was then
modified for SCCA track racing.  This
2003 Mustang coupe was purchased as a
last vehicle type thing (70 years old)
just for fun and nostalgia.  It's a fun
drive, fairly economical and we can get
six suitcases/handbags in the truck. 
It's not going to win any races for me
but it is responsive and comfortable.  "
"A great car  I have had a 4 cylinder 2002 Sonata since new in 2002. It is as good looking a car as is any on the road, it has been absolutely reliable. I have had no costs associated with repairs to the car. I am 70 years of age, and hope to drive this car for another ten years. It has just over 60,000k."
"Calling all recalls  Like most cars, the 2002 Sonata has its recalls and defects, at first this car was rated very high in customer satisfaction and industry standards, for the most part this still holds true despiterecall defects... what i find interesting about the bad features of this vehicle is not that it's a bad car but that simply stated, The only thing bad about this car is mainly small recall issues in its performace design. what i really like about the company is thats they are quick to investigate any problems with this car to fix any malfunctions free of cost...5 stars here..thats called trust!"
"Power Steering Hose Issue  Well, I've been starting to havepower steering fluid leaking all over the place. Took a look up under the car and the high pressure power steering hose is spitting out a lot of fluid. Judging from these reviews this is a very common problem with sonatas. Usually seems to happen around 100K (my 2002 has 105K on it). Definitely a design flaw, but don't know if it meets criteria for a class action. Would do this myself to save some $ but can't really save that much as this is a dealer part that's about $300. I'll let the techs install as I'm sure they've done plenty and the labor (although it's not a 2 second job) is not the brunt of the cost."
"Solid Car  My Sonata now has 130,000 miles on it and repairs are starting to add up. I bought it brand new and have to say up until now, it has been a good purchase. My O2 sensor went out a few times, but was covered by the warranty. The power antennae broke but covered by warranty. The interior door handles also started to peel, but was covered by a recall. At about 75,000 the paint started to bubble on the roof of the car, and at 120,000, the power steering line started to leak, which cost around $300 to fix. The speedometer and cruise control just went out at 130,000, so who knows how much that will be. The car does ride nice and handles beautiful though, maintenance is expensive but would buy again."
"2002 Sonata  Good commuter car, not so great mpg but manageable. Some issues were fixed under warranty; water pump, front window motor replaced and complete instrument panel replaced because of a broken fuel gauge, so reflected mileage is actually less than actual. The cons: front right brakes were replaces but always squeaks, timing belt jumped and damaged the timing sensor before 60k miles and transmission speed sensor went out at 64k mi which cost me $950 and $350 respectively. Dealer said it was not covered under drivetrain warranty, would have wanted to keep this car but problems are starting to pop out."
"Good Car  I purchased my car brand new back in 2002. It now has 123,000 miles on it and I'm now just experiencing a few problems. The power steering line is leaking power steering fluid. From other reviews, it seems like this is a common problem and should possibly be a recall because of a poor design flaw. The paint is also peeling on my roof. A few other minor complaints were the antennae broke, but it was still under warranty, the O2 sensor went out a few times and chrome inside door handles peeled, all covered by a recall. Also, the maintenance is a bit pricey. Now for the good. It handles great and has such a smooth ride. No major problems the first 7 years of ownership. I'll buy a Hyundai again."
"Solid Transportation But  I now have 94K miles and the car has provided 100% reliable transportation. Most reliable car I've ever owned. BUT - the electric antenna never worked right from day one, the clock goes on and off and I can't turn the radio off. It keeps coming on at random times.  Love the car, it drives wonderfully, very comfortable, no repairs except oil and tires. Good mileage. Still looks shiny and new.  The Rick Case purchasing experience was horrible (very manipulative) and their service dept isn't any better. They charged me $460 to do back breaks but only did one and charged me for both. Found a work light hanging from my car when I got home!  I'll buy another Sonata soon but not from them. "
"Hasn't cost me a cent in repairs  I've owned this car for 8 years and other than oil changes and brakes, it hasn't cost me a cent. There was only one minor steering problem a few years ago, which was covered under warranty. It still rides like new.  I would keep this car forever, but I'm ready to try out a Hyundai Santa Fe. Hands down, best car I've ever owned, and I've owned quite a few over the years."
"Best car owned  I have over 140,000 miles on my car and so far I've only replaced minor parts due to wear and tear. Its very reliable and easy to repair for  the do-it-themselves type. Parts are cheap and durable. I expect to at least drive another 100,000 before considering another car."
"Super car !  Sonata was my first car. I have driven many cars as rentals or those that belong to friends, including Ford mustang, oldsmobile alero, chrysler sebring, dodge neon, ford taurus and toyota avalon. I think Sonata beats all these other cars hands down. The audio for a 2002 model is quite good, the looks (i think!) are extraordinary, the drive is smooth as butter. After more than 100,000 miles of driving I can say that its been quite reliable. I haven't used the 100,000 mile road-side assistance at all except once when my old batteries ran out while it was sitting in my driveway. Its time to buy my second car and Sonata 2010 is one of my first choices for the test-drive. Great job,Hyunda!"
"Bang For The Buck  I've had several 
new Porschs, Bmw's. Vintage Jags, 
Masarati, This mustang 
will be my teenage daughters first car 
in 3 years I love this lil' car 
it is fun to drive, the rag top is a 
good rush and it's for cheap for what 
you get the bang for the buck is good. 
It's 
smooth on the highway-I have the 6 cyl 
(so my daugher doesn't have over the 
top HP) it cruizes at 80+ smooth and 
easy. I read the editors negative 
comments on the interior finish -and 
really disagree --it's fine. "
"New Transmission at 87,000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is the first Hyundai I have owned.  It is an '02 w/87,000 miles.  It needs a entire new transmission, which the dealer said would cost $2800. I have owned Ford, Chrysler and Jeep vehicle and never had a problem of this magnitude.  The ford even has 223,00o miles.  When I took it to the dealer the first time the check engine light came on AutoZOne told me it was a Shift Control Solenoid code.  "
"Good Vehicle  I have been driving the car for 7 years and have almost 70K. So far no major problems, brakes and tires, kept up with the Maintenance schedule. Little things like the clock has been replaced and still does not work right, drivers side wiper keeps coming loose and have to carry wrench to tighten. Had to replace the antenna would not work in freezing temps.  The car has lots of power and can keep with the best of them. I average about 20 around town and to be honest never checked it on a trip.  I would buy another hyundai without any hesitation, but now looking at at Acura, want to upgrade a little.  Seats and interior all has held up well"
"My first car in this country  I bought this car from a dealer when the Odometer reading was about 72K. Since then I have driven less than 3K. Like the car's style and pickup on the signals. It leaves almost every car in the rear view! I have tried that with cars like Lexus, BMW, Toyota and Honda and my Sonata picks up faster than all of them!  The maintenance is costly for this car and I have changed the Alternator (about $500), Power Steering Pressure Hose (about $450) and general maintenance.  The car's engine gives some noise which a mechanic couldn't figure out why. I need to take that to dealership (again $$$). Also the Air bag signal has turned Red which only dealer can see ($$$). So expensive drive for 3K travel."
"Great Car  I bought this car off the showroom floor and it has been the most reliable car that I have owned.  I have owned a Chevrolet, an Oldsmobile,  a Ford, and a Mitsubushi.  The only I have done on my Sonata is oil changes,  a new set of brakes and two sets of tires.  I have 125,000 miles now on my car and I plan on buying a new Sonata in the near future.  The only issues I have had is a ""phantom"" stereo.  The CD player died at 100,000 and I cannot turn the radio off.  There has been little paint peeling on the roof."
"Great car.  I would buy another one  We bought car with 11,000.  We have 98,000 miles and only minor repairs.  Runs great and gets great mpg.  Rides great, shifts smooth.  Not a lot of horsepower ( 4 cylinder , 140 hp) but I love the idea of 30 mpg in a mid-size car.  I will run this on into the ground.  No reason to sell it."
"Cheap Parts!  We bought the car because we loved the styling and we liked the fuel economy.  And while I still like both, I have been faced with costly services ever since!  Most annoying is that my drivers side power window keeps malfunctioning.  I soon will have replaced it twice in 1 year and 1 month!  Also, I had always been pleased with the ""ride"" of this car locally.  However, when my daughter moved to a location 7 hours away and I started driving that distance, I found it almost unbearable.  I'm not alone, everyone who has ridden with me at that distance is in pain.  We cannot ride without pillows to prevent numbness!  And that is true for people ranging in age from 35 to 70.  Cute, not great!"
"Don't buy this car  I would not recommend this car to anyone. It caused me nothing but problems and was a black hole to my bank account. Every time something was fixed, something else broke or needed repairs. I will never buy another Korean vehicle again because of the cheap quality of this car. I should have known better."
"Rate My Ride  I have been driving my Sonata for 6 years and have little or no trouble with it.  I have been keeping up the maintenance schedule and only taking it to the dealer for my service work. I now have approximately 58,000 miles on my car and the timing chain went and am now faced with rebuilding the engine, at a cost of $1,500.00, Hyundai is going to pick up the rest as a good faith gesture. I would not suggest that you keep this car past 50,000 miles. They say in the warranty 10 years or 100,000 miles.  I'm not sure this car is designed to last that long.   Really Bummed in Connecticut."
"Worth every dime. Best value.   Paid $17,500 for it while competition was going for 19 to 22,000. Bang for the buck could not be beat. Very, very good car. "
"Warranty not what they claim  I absolutely loved my car.  A few minor flaws, such as the interior handles needing to be replaced several times, and the armrest wasn't the most comfortable. Other than that a fantastic car.  However, I now have 30,550 miles on my car and the fuel door doesn't open. (Not covered under the extend warranty that I purchased for an additional $1265.)Now the car is also due for 30,000. mi maintenance - $400., and drive belt (required) $600. Yet the car is only worth $4500-$5000. You do the math.   I won't buy another!!"
"Horribly cheap interior  Dash, seats and shifter is cheap."
"Affraid to get a different car  The 2002 Sonata was the first new car I ever bought.  I've been driving it now for close to 7 years and put 137,000 miles on it.  At 100,000 my brakes begin to wear out.  This is the only time I've had to take it in for major work, but new brakes at 100,000 miles is normal.  My Sonata drives today at 137,000 as well as it did when I drove it off the lot with 12 miles on it.  I believe that in order to get any car as good as the Sonata, I will have to either get another Sonata or a BMW, Mercedes, or Audi to get the same quality that I've gotten from the 2002 Sonata.  It has been nothing less than superior in all areas of performance and reliability.  I Will have a very hard time replacing it."
"my 2002 sonata experience  I have owned the car for 5 years. First let me tell you for the first 60,000 miles zero problems as long as a kept up the maint. After tho power steering pressure hose burst 560.00, ignition crank sensor failed 600.00. During this time many interior and exterior pieces started coming loose and generally looking bad. struts now bad too. 75,000 miles the timing belt fails and destroys the engine to the point where it needs a rebuild. Id ditch the car after 60k, its resale value is so low its not worth the repairs. now have a year old toyota and a six thousand dollar paper weight."
"I Love My Car  I love my car.  I have had things go wrong with it: replacing four window regulators, one speed input sensor, one speed output sensor, one oxygen sensor, but other than that, this car has been great in the near six years I have owned it.  I love it more than the Plymouth I had before (for 14 years).  It has such a comfortable interior that I can drive it for long periods of time and not get tired or sore.  When I first got it in 2001, it was a big head turner and people would come up to me and go, ""That's a Hyundai?!""  They thought it was a Jaquar, BMW or a Mercedes.  Mine is black with black/gray interior and it looks sophisticated. Still looks like new because I take good care of it."
"2 Litre Sonata CDX Auto. (UK Spec).  Well, what can I tell you?.......I thought long and hard before buying my Sonata, but what a good choice it was! Only things to go wrong in three years of ownership was a sensor broke down inthe engine, (easy fix warranty), and a sidelght bulb blew, 5 minute job to put right I love driving this car, and occasionally, when I am in hurry up mode, I use the ""tiptronic"" gear change, I have to say that this isn't very often, as I mostly prefer to drive at a more relaxed pace and let the auto do it's stuff, which it does with super smooth aplomb! So far I have 42000 on the clock, which is low mileage for the year. Great car, highly recommend!"
"great commuter car  A little too wide for a city car, and slightly sluggish on acceleration (it is not meant to be a muscle car, though). Otherwise, a great commuter/travel/hwy car. Never had any real problems, very dependable. "
"Love my car  I researched quite thoroughly before buying my Sonata 2002 used in July '06. Reliability and Safety scores made the difference for me. Since I've bought it I couldn't be happier. The car is beautiful; have gotten comments from friends and strangers about its looks--""looks like a Jag"". Besides that I love the car; it looks great, ride is smooth and powerful, very quiet. The interior is comfortable, spacious and beautifully appointed, the stereo system sounds great. This is probably the nicest car I've owned even though it is 5 years old, and I've owned an a new Accord, a Celica and a Mazda 626. First used car I buy and best buy I ever made."
spunky's review  I was extremely pleased with the performance of this vehicle.  I just traded it in on a 2007 model. This car was quite possibly one of the best cars I've ever driven.  
"Hyundai has outdone Japan   Bought this used (1 yr old) from dealer (pgm car) with 11K miles. My wife and I have put 35K on is since, and this car has not needed to see the dealer since, with the exception of 1 recall. Other than regular maintenance, this car has needed nothing, and still looks and runs like new. The car has depreciated less than $3,000 in the 3 years we've owned it, and now I'm shopping for one for my son. If you want a good, stylish, reliable and economic car, the Sonata should be your first choice. "
"Nothing but problems  Love the style, price, etc.But...I've had nothing but problems- only had car for 6 wks. rotors had to be replaced- warped,$400+, multiple belt problems, vibration in steering wheel, interior handles cheaply made - caused cuts on hands, brakes not covered under warranty- pulley problem was causing belts to be replaced every 2 weeks.Took back to dealership 5 times within less than 5 months for high pitched noises in front end.The pulley was chewing the belts up.Problems with engine cutting out.Carfax check prior to purchase showed car was clean.I'm reporting this under lemon law and trying to get another car, but because of amount owed will have negative equity in car. Very disappointed!"
"Best kept Secret  This midsize sedan is highly underrated due to the earlier history of Hyundai automobiles. I've owned 2 Chevrolets, 2 Plymouths, 1 Rambler, 1 Dodge, 1 Mustang, 2 Pontiacs, 3 Buicks, 1 VW, and 3 Oldsmobiles. My company cars have included 4 Chevrolets, 2 Fords, and an Oldsmobile. My Hyundai Sonata LX V6 is as good or better than any of the new cars mentioned above, and at a fraction of the price. Sonata has been a well kept secret, but the cat is out of the bag. Like the ad says, ""Drive it and you'll buy it!"""
"WOW!  That's all I can say--WOW! This car is 
a dream come true for me.I read other 
reviews and was concerned about two 
things--a ""rough"" drive and the seats 
being comfortable.  She's a smooth 
ride, and the seats are the more 
comfortable than any other car I've had 
or been in. This car has a lot of ""get 
up and go"" for a 6 cylinder, and I'm 
impressed at how fast it responds.  My  
only concern is the cost to insure this 
car--I couldn't find a quote below $90 
a month, and I have an excellent 
driving record.  Otherwise, this car is 
a dream come true!"
"Better than expected  Bought car with 57K & 16mos later have 84K. Great car. Smoother ride than our Windstar. In fact wife will take the Sonata over the Windstar often. Two dealers in my area wonderful. Even matched price of local garage to keep my business. Only major problem was a missfiring cylinder. After paying $400+ to get spark plugs, engine flush etc done, went back in a week and they had to replace the oxygen sensor. Other than that, it does pull to the left and after alignment steering wheel shakes. also, water in the taillamp...$220+ to fix/replace. Those probs aside, it really has been a great car. Would totally buy another one. 1800+ miles/month got me 25mpg. City has been 22mpg."
"My first brand new Vehicle  I have owned this vehicle for 3 years and have been very pleased with most aspects of the vehicle. I love the design the ride is noce handling is good, service has been good. Gas mileage although not what expected is not bad for a car of this size.  I boughtr the car for price and warranty length and so far have been happy most of the time.  Areas that have been problems, Paint is not holding up, chips easily from road dirt, seating areas are not wearing well, they show signs of use easily. Not happy at all about only being able to purchase certain parts from Hyundai such as a Battery, brake pads, air filter.  Would buy another Hyundai from the exp, with this vehicle Love the car."
"poor man's jaguar  We bought this car for the wife to tool around in. We use it for all family outings and shopping. It is comfortable around town, quite peppy and delivers acceptable economy [around 27 mpg].The interior is beautiful and easy to keep up. The stereo system is very good. The seats are a little too firm on long rides [8 hours or more] It has been an excellent car for the 20,000 miles we've had it with no problems."
"My Sonata  My husband and I bought our Sonata wanting to trade up from our Cavalier since we were expecting a baby. We haven't had too many problems but it seems when we do, they are VERY expensive to fix and never covered under the warranty. We've been steadily replacing rotors since we bought the things (which can only be bought at the dealership, go figure). I love the exterior!! No major failures as of yet but lots of recalls. The interior has had a lot of little probs. The arm rest on the driver's door ripped with just my husband's elbow resting on it. The silver chips off the inner door handles and leaves razor-sharp edges. WATCH OUT!! We had to sand them. Overall, it's a good car."
"A Great Car  103,000 mi as of 6/05. Has been extremely reliable. Looks great inside and outside. Recently had failure in power steering hose. $400.00 incl. labor for a hose? Air bag warning lite on, $1600.00 for an air bag sensor? They have to rip and send out seat because sensor is under upholstery...needs to be sent out to upholsterer. Engineering is said to be brilliant; I have a hunch from now on is where the money will really go out because of the ""brilliant"" engineering of a 10 foot long power steering hose, etc. P.S. When my 11 year old daughter moved the front seat forward the warning light went off. I wonder???"
"I'll never have ANYTHING ELSE!  I bought my 2002 Sonata Lx in Sept. of 2002, we have put almost 70K on the car in less then 2 and a half years, we just go everywhere in it! We drive 100 miles a day to work round trip, and love the ride home at the end of each day. And with the 2006 comming to the dealer, You can bet I'll be the first in line to ""move up"" to the sleek new body."
"The Best Car Ive Ever Owned  We bought our Sonata shortly after it came out in fall 01'.  The car has been great.  We now have 62,000 miles on it with almost no problems.  Would buy a Hyundai again, and will."
"2002 Sonata  Great car !  I have enjoyed the ride,

"Great car, and holds up well  I've owned it for about 2 1/2 years now, I have about 45,000 miles on it. This was my first car, first manual. The clutch has been slipping for the past 10,000 miles or so (but held up well in my opinion). The handle/knob broke off of the driver seat release to lift it forward in order to get to the back seat. The rear differential has the TSB whining noise during low speed turns. And I also had a problem a few times with the TSB of water leaking into the passenger floorboard and causing some electrical problems. Overall, it's held up very well considering the abuse it's received. The seats are uncomfortable on a 2 1/2+ hour drive. The gas mileage is bearable, and not bad for the performance"

I installed the dual exhaust, cold air intake, and a reprogrammer. This pony bucks now! It also rides like a dream. The fuel mileage is great on the highway, not so much in town. But that's my fault. Definitely get the 5 speed."

"Best bang for your buck!  This is my third Mustang, my last being an '88 GT convertible that I also bought new.  What a difference 18 years can make!  This car is faster, smoother, quieter (yes, I know a convertible is noisier, I'm comparing to friends' '88 GT hatchback), quicker around the corners, stops better, sounds better and gets better gas mileage to boot.  What's not to love?  This car was love at first sight.  I sold two cars to swing the downpayment and special ordered the car with all the toys - 18"" wheels, and a 1000 watt 6 disc with subwoofers in the trunk.  I'm a stick shift guy and this car has a wonderfully smooth transmission that shifts much better than my '88 GT.  I commute 55 mi./day and get 22mpg"

"A Great Pony  I bought mine new in July of 06. v6  Legend Lime w/pony package. I went with the V6 due to price and insurance cost. After adding a S&B CAI, Predator tune, and GT muffler, I bumped up the hp to that of a small block v8, about 240hp.  A 4:10 is going in shortly to makeup for the automatic. The v6 is a great platform to start off on if your on a tight budget. Responds well to S/C's which take the v6 to the 310hp range. I don't have that many miles on the car, but I haven't had any issues with it. I still get many compliments from people when I am out and about. I have no regrets with this car. It's a blast."

Having owned a '65 Mustang Fastback for many years I really wasn't expecting to be impressed by the new Mustangs. Boy was I wrong. With each session behind the wheel of the new Pony, the poor handling, braking and lack of air conditioning of my classic Pony becomes even more evident. The new Pony really is more fun to drive. Even though I bought the car for my daughter, I do get to drive it when it needs gas. Which isn't that often since the peppy V6 gets 18-20mpg in town & 26-30 mpg on the road. So many styling cues taken from the early Mustangs I feel right at home in this car.      "

"Just Good  The car is a great commuter car. Not really a quick car (0-60mph 7-7.3 sec) from my experience (I have an auto). The tires are loud on the freeway and can get annoying on long trips.  The ride comfort on the freeway is good, but a litle stiff on city roads. Also there is a lot of body roll while cornering at over 18 mph. The transmission shifts nice and smooth, but it is not the quickest shifting transmission. The fuel economy is not bad in the city I get 18-20 mpg, but if I use cruise control on the freeway I average 24-28 mpg."
"Best Buy  This is a car that will fulfill all of 
your expectations-it is fast, fun and 
reliable.  The sound system is great, 
the engine will take you wherever you 
want to go in a ""snap-fast"" manner, and 
tires will ensure you never have to 
worry about ""side-sway"" or slide into 
turns.  I recommend it highly, and 
think that if you decide to buy one you 
will be nothing but a proud owner of 
the original muscle car!"

wheel.Replaced battery in 03.Have never 
had any other problem. Am on my third 
set of tires, change the oil ever 3000 
miles. Add gasoline and go. Like it 
enought to buy my wife a 2000 same type 
car from World Ford in Hollywood FL. It 
has 82000 miles. For less than $20,0000 
you cant do better. I have no reason to 
believe the 2004's are any different. 
Its the same basic automoble."
"6 cylinder dog - terrible disappointment  Terrible disappointment. I just test
drove a new 2004 6 cylinder.  I am
shopping for a 180+ hp, rear wheel
drive, american made car with good gas
mileage.  I thought the 6cyl 'stang
would foot the bill, but came it up
terribly short.  The car is so heavy
that the cheesy 6 cylinder motor can't
seem to get out of it's own way.  I
recall my 1993, 140hp, 6 cylinder
beretta having much better acceleration.
 I wonder if the 5 speed performs any
better.  The interrior would be great if
this were 1989!"
"Never buying a ford again  It is a fun car till you have owned it 
for 4 years. Even with continious 
maintenance I still have problems. 
Check engine light, shifting into 5th 
gear is a grinding experience and 
shakes when in the idle position. The 
top also leaks when washed or it rains."
"It's a keeper  I was attracted to this car by it's sharp looks and great performance, and after four years, I still love it. It may not be the fastest car on the road, but it's the biggest bang for the buck, and will surely blow off most of the boy racers. The horsepower and torque figures are claimed to be 305 and 320 respectively, but the dyno has shown substantially higher numbers. This is my fourth Mustang, the last one being a 98 Cobra, very similar to this, but I like the Mach better. Gas mileage is really very good for a performance car at 23 - 28 mpg. If you can find a clean example at a decent price, go for it.  I'll be keeping mine for a long while. It's sure to be a collector.  "
"Ford does make quality vehicles  Before getting the Mach1, I despised Fords and believed I would never buy one. The Mach1 was too good looking and fast to pass up. Its 40th anniversary emblems with its hood scoop and awesome rims turned heads. Its performance is great as well, but you pay for it in terms of gas mileage. Since owning the Mach1, I have not had anything go wrong. At worst, the interior dashboard and fixtures are cheap and quality but not something that cannot be replaced. Tires are costly but that is one of the costs anticipated when purchasing a high performance car. This is one vehicle"
Really Neat Time Machine  This vehicle is a great value and takes me back to when I was a kid.  I've always admired the Mach 1's from my youth and this one delivers on par with the original.  Superior car on the road and always gets attention.  My wife digs it too!
"Built Ford Tuff  I waited to buy a Mustang after I saw that a new boby style was coming out.  I ordered mine from my brother who is a manager at a Ford dealer. Over the phone I showed him several web sites that had the type of spoiler, stripes and front air dam that I wanted. I grew up with sixties muscle cars and wanted mine to look retro. So many people stopped me to ask about the car that it began to get embarassing. The car look great. Dark Blue with white LeMans stripes, and a duck tail spoiler. My neighbor(its been across the street for 2 yrs)asked my wife what kind of milage I was getting with that old muscle car. She told him 20+ combined city/Hwy. he called her a lier,and she told him it was an 06. "
"Still one happy customer @ 90000 miles.  I'm 55, after lifting the hood, I went for my checkbook. I was looking for a V-8 Mustang but not this orange beast I bought.  Looking out from behind the shaker hood in the drivers seat and ""feeling"" the freaky sound of the machine is the only way to go. The only car worth driving period. I went slow for 100 miles, next few hundred broke it in at many, many, redline shifts to get it used to me.  It loves it, nothing has broken and I've got almost 100K on it now. Why stop driving it at 26mpg?  Just put on some Blizzaks!  Giddyup. "
Mach 1 is good  I love this car. It has great performance and it rides well. I have had no problems with it so far. It is my first sports car.
"Great performance car  All around, the best of all pre-2005 Mustangs.  320hp but it can be short-shifted at 2000 rpms and can start off in 2nd without lugging; can skip gears.  Excellent throttle response at all engine speeds.  Ride is good, not harsh. Get 25-26 on hwy. Traction control is helpful; it is easy to spin the tires, especially on wet roads.  I have one as my daily driver; it is less common than the standard GT; 60 more HP, better steering, larger brakes from the Cobra, subframe connectors, better (Tokiko) shocks. Noise is a little high, but not bad on the highway.  Get the 5 speed manual; it's the only way to go!  Will probably hold value better than all but the Cobra models."

No major mechanical issues to report and have taken several long road trips in it with good comfort. The mustang GT offers great bang for the buck performance and decent fuel economy. The car is easy to work on for all the do it your self guys and gals. Would I buy a mustang again you betcha...

Mach 1 Mustang  Awesome! Best bang for the buck!
What a beautiful car  I just bought my 2006 Mustang GT. This is an amazing vehicle. Mine came with an after market intake and Ford racing exhaust. These two mods make a huge difference to the performance. I would highly recomend them. I can say I get looks from everyone when I drive by. The fuel milege is pretty good for a V8 with 300HP. The Shaker 500 stereo is very good for being stock. The only thing that I would like to see is a more race inspired bucket seat in the front. Other than that wouldn't change a thing.

"#1 Car to drive  I loved my 2003 Mustang GT deluxe coupe, but all it took was a short test drive for me to trade it in for a 2006 GT premium coupe (both manual transmissions). The increase in horsepower and safety was what truely convinced me.  I mostly do in town driving and average about 20 mpg, but I took two trips both over 1200 miles where I averaged 26 mpg.  I had to have the stereo replaced about 4 months after I got it, but since then I have had no problems.  I have a friend who owns a V6 and he didn't think that there was much difference between his and mine until he took it for a quick spin in the parking lot, now he is thinking of trading his in. "

DONT BUY A MUSTANG!  I made the mistake of buying one of these 2006 lemons. It is sitting in the shop w 46000 miles on it..the bill? $3000. Entire rear diff has to be replaced including the axles are shot. Theres a service bulletin so get yours checked! Ford offered to pay 750..I drive it like a baby and a rear diff should not go out that early. Research and you will find Im not the only one. Im not fixing this lemon. Its going to its grave and Im buying a foreign car. Called Ford..they said thanks for calling...they dont stand behind their cars so why would I put myself in one? Perfect personalized plate would be FORDLMN if I was gonna keep it. Save yourself the hassle and heartache....dont buy one.

"My first Stang  By far my favorite car I've owned. Was wary about Ford but not anymore, has been very reliable. No rattles, no broken pieces. Car accelerates and handles well. Acceleration and cruising at high speeds definitely are strongest points. Love the exterior and interior styling. I get lots of compliments. Older style Mustang drivers strike up conversations. Little kids come up to me. College dudes and teens in small Japanese sporty cars often want to race. Trunk space sufficent. Compared 350z and rx-8 when looking. 350z was not dailly commute friendly, RX-8 too small. nothing compares with the brawn and muscle of a mustang right now. Only negative is handling in rain and snow."

Hood insulation started burning at 2,500, fixed. Trunk popped on its own, fixed after 3 dealer visits. No start or die at idle, dealer cant find a problem. Mustang stripes below doors bubbled up, not fixed! Two weeks ago my car totally died, after fighting with Corporte Ford a week they let the dealer look at it, ignition coil pack fell off, yeah fell off, how in the hell!

"""Payback Pony""  While in hospital for 4 months, I used the latest style Mustang as my ""carrot to recovery."" My 1st ""pinned in the seat"" experience was in a '68 428 (I was 9). V6 goes like a small V8. In Canada, Ford markets this as the ""Pony Pkg,"" which includes the handling pkg (ABS, traction control, and rear sway bar). Beautiful ""Bullitt"" wheels (17"") and Pirrelli's, are included, along with Pony badging. 5 speed auto is smooth and saves gas (22 mpg imp). Build quality rivals my Camry. The vented, 4 wheel disc brakes are amazing! Car really handles well, too. Overall, I'm very pleased, with this well balanced car. The 210 horsepower V6 is ample for today's economy/gas prices/speed limits.          "

10,000 miles the Transmission went out.

has been reborn.  It is everything the
original was, if it were to be made
today.  A working shaker hood, 17""
heritage wheels, ""comfort weave"" seats
and a 305hp (45 more than the GT) 4.6L
engine to power it.  This is a retro
muscle car lovers dream.  I have loved
mine since the first mile I test drove
it, and with every mile thereafter.  It
is a thing of beauty with a hint of
beast lurking underneath!"
"opinion  This vehicle is under powered for the 
true Mustang enthusiast. Ford needs 
more options for its engine power and 
power train (gear ratio). It would help 
to have a 430-475hp option. Make a true 
muscle car, not something everybody buy 
to look stylish to go to the grocery

"Wild Stang  I purchased my 2006 GT convertible used from a dealer. It was 11 years old with only 22,800 miles on it. I had to see it to believe it. It was so beautiful.   Black  with red leather interior. I purchased the vehicle on site after a test drive of course. This is my 4th mustang and my third convertible. I am addicted to the mustangs. This model does remind me of my 1969 Grande  coupe I had. The lumbar support is a definite improvement for the lower back on this 2006 GT premium. This was a problem in my previous mustangs for longer trips over an hour or so. The pick up in acceleration is fantastic. I agree Ford should cut back on the plastics in the interior because it cheapens the vehicle.  I have a shaker 1000 system and it sounds really good. The cd player is garbage. The first cd I placed in it got stuck. I get plenty of looks and compliments all the time on her. This is a good cruiser car and the family and I enjoy the ride tremendously. Top down rolling down the highway is so soothing and therapeutic. I had a 2002 convertible and 2004 convertible and using the convertible top is a breeze on these newer models than the previous models. The top seems to completely fall into place without effort and you just lock it down with the lighter handles. I would have been great to have power passenger seat. I believe the passenger seat is too low and should have a power package or at least a manual lever to raise the seat or lower the seat and give lumbar support. The rear seats seem comfortable enough.  For a convertible, it is roomier than the Mercedes, jaguar and camaro.  The camaro does not compare. If you really look around, you can see more variations of mustangs by mustang owners than camaros. If you have a mustang, you can almost totally redesign the mustang to your personal needs with all the parts and accessories the  market have available for mustangs.  These have been very reliable. The previous fox body styles, 1999 - 2004 did have this seal leak between the transmission and engine that was annoying after about 90,000 miles and it was not a cheap fix. I am praying these new mach 1 body styles do not such flaws.  I have noticed though, the a/c in my older models got colder quicker was much colder. I saw a comment to the opposite so I am not sure why this is. I have had an 02 and 04 and you could freeze to death in there with the a/c on max. I did notice after running on the highway for a while, the car would stall if I got off the exit, stopped and then tried to take off again. I am not sure why this model does that. Over all, good price for a fun and reliable vehicle."

2004 Ford Screaming Mustang Convertible  I'm a 49 year young man who used to be a Pontiac Trans am  man but once I drove this baby I was hooked! I love my Mustang. I have a 2004 40th anniversary edition that I'm restoring to look like she was just rolled off the show room floor with some of my own classified modifications that will put the GT to shame LOL
"Great fun, great value!  You can drive the 1999-2004 Mustang V6 convertible year-round in most parts of the country.  Mine has been my daily driver since 2007, driven in Ohio and Tennessee.  The heater works great in the winter - no different than in any other car.  And as soon as the temps start to climb in the spring, down goes the top!   It is low to the ground, so getting in and out of the driver's seat definitely isn't for people with stiff backs.  Maintenance is pretty easy - the engine compartment is big enough to reach all of the spark plugs.  In over 100,000 miles I've only replaced the clutch once (3.9 liter engine with T5 tranny), and the top once (roughly $1000)."
"90,000 km, and all's good!!  Bought the car with 9,000 km and 11 months old. The car has 90,000 km as of May 2010. The car has been bullet proof in terms of reliability. I have just replaced the tires and the original battery. The only issues have been: Engine check light on briefly at 87K, and self-cleared (must have been a loose gas filler cap), and the rear tail light bulbs blow every 15K or so ($4 bulb-big deal). Other than that: just oil and filter changes. Car has been very reliable and solid. Body creaks/groans at 90K are still minimal, but you can now tell the car is nearly 4 years old, lots of life left in it. I will replace shocks & struts this year and this should solve the problem."
"Super Pony Car !  This is my first Mustang, first convertible and first V6 !I really wanted a convertible, and it really is great !You actually feel good sitting in and driving the car, and it is spunky enough for a sports car.Really enjoyable, the interior is really pretty, all leather.My 8 year old girl iis overjoyed, and myself being 50 I really have a great time driving it, with or without the top down. Used to have a 5 liter Capri back in the 80s, and although that had a lot more power this newer Mustang is much more comfortable to drive. Gas mileage for this V6 is pretty good !Beate, Frederick, MD"
"It's a Mustang  Rides like a buckboard, reasonable handling, mileage, and the Mach stereo is a beast! If you don't like a Mustang convertible, let's look at your choices. An older Cavalier, a Sebring or LeBaron that will likely have numerous issues, a costly BMW or a Porsche that is likely beyond costly for similar year and miles. It's the only choice out there under $12,000 with low miles. "
"The Ultimate Toy for those over 49  My black Mustang rides like a buckboard, the leather seats are flat, the interior door panels and console are cheap. It's a Mustang for crying out loud. It's an icon, a legend. The Mach 6 CD am-fm stereo is simply amazing. Your choices for a convertible are rather limited. A Chysler Sebring, a Pontiac that they quit making, a BMW with a price tag over two times any similar Mustang. The Mustang is the only logical choice. Smooth and easy top operation. The trunk holds what it needs too. Golf clubs, baseball bags, tennis rackets, groceries, 2 medium suitcases. No its not big, its a sports car, not a luxo boat. The people that complain about this car are ill, please see a doctor. "
"My 3.9L  We had a choice between a few beautiful 'stangs and bought this '04 40th anniversary edition. Fully loaded with a Mach stereo system. I upgraded the air filter, plugs and oil which made a major difference. I run at least 25-28 mpg, even going 80+mph. It handles very well, drove through a wy. winter storm and stuck to the road. Gotta love my 3.9L!"
"red rocket  Too good looking to pass up, always wanted a muscle car. A blast to drive and love the burble of the exhaust. Agree with other comments that 1st is too short and 5th too tall. Gas mileage seems to vary wildly for no particular reason. from 11-17 around town. Prehistoric technology that makes me smile."
"How do you spell fun to drive  I have owned classic hot rods from the 60's, this is as much fun to drive with the comforts of new options. This is my second Mustang GT convertible, love it!"
"Go Topless  The 2004 Anniversary Convertible is the way to go to celebrate your mid life crisis. The styling is sleek and the sonic blue is a classly color with twin 10"" silver bumper to bumper stripes. The V-6 has more than enough power and the automatic shifts extremely smooth. The convertible top is quiet at highway speeds and is so simple to raise and lower. The bucket seats are firm and there is enough leg room and head room. Forget about the back seats being comfortable, they are there for looks only, not for carrying passengers. But, heck, the Stang is for having fun for two. The interior is well designed and controls are easy to reach and use. The fit and finsh is better than some more expense car"
2004 Mustang  I've had this car for 2 years and it's amazing.  It's everything you'd expect from 6 cylinders and a little more.  And it turns heads everywhere I go!  
"Bruce's Mustang  One hot car. 5th  gear is only used after 60.  It is amazing that at 80, it is turning just 2000 rpm.  No joke.  I took a trip at 60 to 70 mph and got 22.8 mpg. Most times I get right around 19 to 20 mpg.  It is very difficult to find information about this car.  How many were manufactured?  HP/WEIGHT ratio. How much are the commemorative medallions valued at.  I have six of them.  I have special wheels bought from a noted tire dealer.  I have been offered $250 or more for the original alloy rims.  Why are they worth anything at all?  3 people have offered me at least that much money."
"Stangs Rock  This is a very stable convertible. Very still ride, not all loose and rubbery like most convertibles and the power is awesome!"
"First Stang  I bought this car used with 17,000 miles and it was in perfect condition. The acceleration is decent but could always use more power. Handling has been excellent even in the 3 blizzards we've had this year. You do get bounced around quite a bit on bumpy roads but then again, it's not exactly a luxury car. My Color back-lighting is a cool feature to play around with. Insurance surprisingly wasn't that bad (considering I live in NJ). All in all this car has been amazing to own and a blast to drive considering it's a 110 HP improvement over my previous car. "
"premium gt vert  I drive the Mustang very little because I want to keep it really nice.  It is redfire with the light parchment interior and top.  The quality of the interior is not up to par with the imports, but for the price, the performance is a bargain.  The car reminds me of my 1969 Ford Torino GT, which is a good thing.  The difference is that the Mustang actually handles well. I think the Mustang is a great car for anyone who appreciates American v-8 power. It feels like the days of old, but with refinement.
 "
"Can't go wrong  With the rush to get the new 2005 Mustangs, smart buyers bought the 2004 models at tremendous savings. The convertibles were well built cars with no leftover kinks from prior years. The performance for the 3.9L 6 cylinder is more than adequate and if you don't constantly 'floor it' the gas mileage is outstanding. We were able to obtain 25+ mpg combined city/highway on a 3900 mile vacation. Incredible! If you are in the market for a used nice looking sports car convertible, do not hesitate to buy a LOW mileage adult driven model. The price should be right with everyone else wanting the 'new' styles. No disappointments, and with gas so high, you can basically have it all with this model."
"2004 Mustang Rocks  At 6'7"" leg room is a must and this Mustang delivers mucho leg room.  Getting 30 miles to the gallon."
love this car  I love my car; it is great in the mountains -- just pure fun.
"Love My Pony!  I was looking for a convertible and test drove the 40th Anniversary in December, to ""take it off my list"" because I was sure it was going to be too small. Once I got in it I knew it was mine.  It is fun to drive and fun to own!"
"Yee Haw  This car is so much fun to drive, especially with the top down.  Everyone agrees it's a great looking car. My first car was a '67 Mustang and I always vowed I get another one day. The incentives in December were too good to pass up on so I opted to buy then instead of waiting for the 2005's to come out. I am not unhappy with my decision at all!"
"Oily Problem  Frustrated owner of a new 2004 with only 
1400 miles.  The first 300 the car 
started leaking oil.  They supposely 
fixed this; then went on a road trip around 
350 miles oil leaked again.  Found out 
that there are 181 cars out there that 
have this problem.  Ford will not take 
back the car which I want them to do.  
Dealer is ok, but certain higher ups 
were rude to me...WATCH OUT...."
"Great Car  This car is great ! It handles very 
good, passing gear is really great, 
sterio is fantastic, it is an eye 
catcher on the road, cruises without 
any effort, everything about this car 
is what I expected. Only thing I see 
wrong is that now that I have mine, is 
that I see a lot of others ones on the 
road now."

I still get comments from people. I have never had a brake job and I'm at 63k miles and still have 20% wear left.  Solid, solid, solid is what this car is.  I won't ever get rid of it.  Best thing Ford ever did."
"My First Car  I love this car.  My whole family is jealous.  My mom, who drives a Porshe Boxter, is always asking if she can drive it.  It has good horsepower. Fun to drive."

"Disappointed  I was excited to finally drive a Mustang, that is why 
I decided to rent one for a few days. The 6 cyl 
engine with the automatic tranmission is 
underpowered. This car is slow and feels heavy. The 
interior build quality seems very cheap. The plastic 
holding the window buttons on the driver's side 
door is already loose (at 14K miles!). I am 6'2"" and 
the height of the interior seems OK. The seats are 
alright as well. The 6 disc changer stereo sounds 
good. I have not tried to remove the top, because it 
seemed complicated. This might be an OK car, but I 
would expect much more from a Mustang in terms 
of performance (even if this is an automatic one)."
"Mustang love  Was at the dealership to buy a Focus.  
Out on the lot they had parked all of 
the Foci next to a Redfire color 
Mustang convertible, 40th anniversary 
special.  It said ""buy me"" to me.  
Either that or the saleman had super 
telepathic powers.  Dealer must have 
seen me coming.  I couldn't resist.  
Really great car to drive.  Want to 
keep it forever."
"My First Ford  Probably the poorest engineered  and 
poorest quality vehicle I've ever 
owned, it's my 10th vehicle.  I've had 
nothing but problems since I bought the 
car, I actually got it in July 2002. 
I'm glad the dealer decided to sneak a 
premium extended warranty in on the 
contract, I have a feeling a lot more 
will go wrong after the initial 36,000 
miles."

I bought my gt because I got a good deal, and because I've always wanted a v8 mustang. Acceleration is awesome, you can hear this thing breathe. Handles well also. Takes corners like its on rails. Interior is ok, not as bad as some say, well to my standards. Leather is great, convertable top is awesome. Mpg is not that bad for me. I get around 18 city, and 26 on highway, I have a heavy foot too. Love the retro style... Don't regret purchasing this beast. Wish I had more power, but I can fix that with aftermarket stuff."

"Great retro fun, but...  Bought this car after convincing my wife we ""needed"" a convertible. Since we have a child, we needed something with a back seat. Since I needed a ""sports"" car (re: not FWD), the Mustang was the only real option. After years of disliking Mustangs (Fox platform versions), and driving several Japanese cars (Civics, WRX, etc), I was pleasantly surprised how quickly this car reminded me what's important in a car...a good sounding and performing engine, great looks, and back-to-basics simplicity, which means living with some shortcomings. The rear live axle can feel a little unplanted on rough roads during spirited cornering. The interior materials quality is also low-rent in look and feel."

"Get Rid of it before 100K  I drive 50 miles each way to work and traded my 01 accord for a 06 mustand in 2008. Well 80k miles later the engine starts having this knocking noise and significant loss of power and not because I don't take care of my car as I changed my oil every 3K miles and keep it very well maintained. After Ford looked at the car they quoted me $4,100 to fix what they called a cam phaser issue (pumps oil to the top end of the motor). Needless to say I pulled the car from Ford and took to a performance shop, who said it needed a new motor for $4,800. Well thats great but this is not my toy its my daily driver. Long story short before you buy research cam phasers this appears to be an issue in many Ford"
"Great Ride!  I had wanted a Mustang since my teen years and bought one 30 years later. I bought the base model. I havent had any trouble with it since purchasing. Has great get up and go I love shifting gears!  Holds the road great and that says something with all the winding country roads we have in WV. Good gas mileage on the highway, not so good in city. "

This car is my daily-driver, rain, shine or snow. It has never failed to get me home, even in the snow! I've added a strut tower brace and a more-efficient (louder) exhaust. The exhaust seems to have helped the gas-mileage (avg 21- 22mpg mixed city/freeway). It is a comfortable car to take a trip in and the 500 watt stereo is fine. No squeaks or rattles."

Well, I love it. The build quality is great. The performance is exhilarating. And it is always fun, fun, fun.

Got that fixed 2 weeks later, my school books where soaking wet I left my bookbag in the trunk. I thought the top was leaking, but after 8 trips to dealer with the car being there for as many 30 days to get it back with same each time we cant find the major leak. I have come to the conculsion that it is leaking from the weld in the body. Back to body problems the Mustang stripe has come off 2 times.

"2006 GT Convertable  We purchased this car one year old, and it has been fantastic in reliability and retro style. Love the convertable roof, stereo is very good (shaker 500), and the car drives extremely well. We traded a very unreliable and quirky Mazda rx8 for this car, and every time I turn the key the Mustang jumps to life and is eager to run. The car handles very well considering its size and gives the driver a confident feel of the road, always in control. A 1500 mile trip to the coast turned in 26 mpg which is great considering the HP/Size (way better than the RX8 too). In town average is around 18 mpg."

"First mustang, last v6  Bought this car on impulse and only had it a few months. To me, this car was not very impressive and had wished I got a v8. It had an airbag recall, a strange knocking in the dash (I guess a common thing) and the paint was peeling. The mustang was pretty big for me as well, I’m 5’2 and it felt like I was driving a boat. The cool things were that I could change the lights in the interior, the taillights were awesome. The resale value was ok, less than I paid for it of course. It’s a pretty car, but would never get a v6 again. Every time I’d see a v8 I’d honeslty feel like I was driving a fake mustang. This particular mustang also had bad breaks and something wrong with the suspension and alignment. The good would also go down with braking. Did not feel safe driving on highways. Could have just been this one. Superingly though this car has a lot of cargo space! It’s amazing!"
"A dream come true  This is the only new car purchase I have ever made in my lifetime and probably will remain so.  I've always been a car guy since my infancy. The family up the street had a yellow '65 mustang with a black roof. I've been hooked ever since. I've owned several Mustangs including a 1979 GT and a '89LX 5.0 which became my daily driver for many years (over 235 thousand miles). My 2010 sleeps in the garage when not in use and it has never been in the rain or snow. It only gets driven on nice days and when I'm not in any hurry whatsoever. This beautiful resonant machine is my dream toy come true. I purchased it brand new in 2009 and it still looks completely new. I experienced a warranty problem with the clutch as several bolts were not torqued to spec at the factory. My dealership fixed it for free (including a brand new clutch) sometime around my third year of ownership. Anyway, I'll keep this car it for as long as I have the mental and physical faculties which allow me to drive. Thereafter, I hope that one or both of our children get to enjoy it.  I have made countless films and videos of it from every angle. It is solid and simple with no added scoops, louvers, fancy aftermarket wheels or other clutter.  Upon doing research to purchase it, I tried a variety of colors in the computer simulated car online and found that sunset gold was the color to go with. It's beautiful, daring different and it can be readily seen by distracted motorists who might be sharing the road with me.  Altogether, I adore the V8 grunt of this thing, the smell of the interior, trunk and underhood areas, the solid feel of the car and its great appearance and handling. The 4.6 V8 with the 3.73 rear end give me all I could ever ask for.  I have only 18k on it currently. Still, I feel like a kid on Christmas morning every time I pop into the garage,  get into it and crank it up. Cheers to Ford!!"
2010 Mustang gt  Great vehicle for cruising around and turning heads. During the winter season preffers to be stored somewhere warm.
"Enough Mustang to make a Blue Oval guy happy  I bought a low mileage (4,700 miles) 2010 Mustang GT Premium in January 2016 and have been extremely happy with this car.  I owned two Fox body Mustangs (an '88 LX with 5.0 and a '92 Mustang GT with 5.0) and this car is head and shoulders above both.  Great performance (3.73 option package with 19-inch Pirelli tires), outstanding gas mileage (24 highway), comfortable and high-tech interior and a great overall value.  This car would blow the doors off of my 2001 SVT Lightning and yet still offers the comfort and economy that a Lightning can't touch.  Best car I've ever owned.  Period."
"Comfortable Muscle  The 2010 Mustang GT Premium is every bit a high quality muscle car that I expected it to be. What it didn't expect is it has also been our favorite car to take trips across the country. This car rides very comfortably and after hours on the road my back and legs are still fresh and not sore at all. The exhaust sound is a muffled roar on the inside which I like because it's not too loud, but at the same time it's rather loud if you standing near it while it drives by. I like this too because others instantly know it's a muscle car but I don't have to shout to talk to passengers. This car runs very smooth and has never given us any issues in 54,000 miles. The 5-speed manual is lots of fun and the only thing that's not perfect on this car as sometimes the shifter will get a little sticky between 2nd and 3rd gear. Other than that excellent car all around. By the way I get 24.5 MPG on long highway trips."
Good value  Great car with out a family.Decent starter mustang lol.
Mustang  
"Great Base model  Traded in our family car (2015 hyundai sonata) for 2ea mustangs with this being one.Let me say first off the v6 with the 4.0 and a 5-speed is one of the most solid setups these guys put together and it doesn't disappoint. Has great power and all but keeps up with my wifes 2014 with the v6 which is supposedly updated and has about 100hp on mine... hmmm lolInterior quality is lacking with hard plastic everywhere but it is a base model and this was bought with long range reliability in mind... and plastic won't rip or fade like leather haha.Seats are sufficient and almost exactly what I remember in my father's setup. Front passengers remain priority and the back has extremely limited  room with smaller seats... adequate for 1 person to stretch across both sides lol.Where this car shines is the exterior and performance. The outside of this car is beautiful in the super red and has more than enough giddy up to have a little fun. Turn off traction control and it gets even better without blowing through tires in the v8.Overall they did a great job with this... Base model is really set up for the pure enthusiast that doesn't need/want many bells and whistles that over time will fail... and everything that could be improved upon has in new models... amazing job on this one ford.***********************************UPDATE*******************************2016-12-15Had a few months to drive this car in all weather conditions and have a few extra notes to add.First off.... this car HATES the extreme cold of ND... I mean really. I know being up here I have to accept it and I did want it. That doesn't make it a deal breaker or bad, just a note... Now for further details:  1. The tranny in this car in the cold is really snotty. What I mean is it will be extremely hard to get into gear or after engaging and put my foot down it will occasionally pop out. I've learned to deal with this as once the car warms up completely the problem almost dissapears.2. The stock tires are still on this thing and were clearly meant for Summer. So unless you're experience at how a car handles get a better set of tires and leave traction on. For me, I am choosing to make it through the winter on these before replacing them with Pirelli's. For now, I just turn off traction control before I move as it actually takes away from the functioning of the car and being able to rock it and almost ANY amount of gas will make the wheels spin in any snow.3. Occasionally in the frigid cold that is ND, the engine will stall when coming to a stop of any sort and I need to restart the vehicle. This is in no part to do with any driving... it's just cold. I do run premium and will hopefully help solve this by Putting some Lucas in my engine next time I service it. My advice for now is unless you really know how to drive a car and can take something with a temper stay away from this one in extremely cold places. I am willing to trade hassle for handling in the warmer months and look to have this car for some time. For me, I'm willing to deal with all the above things as this car is rock solid and being able to drive it in this weather is a real feat some days, proving if I can do it anyone can. If you're in warmer weather you should absolutely LOVE this car. Nothing wrong with it."
"My sweet GT  I've had this car for 6 years now, still love everything about her.  Fun to drive, flawless performance, and a head turner."

It handles like my mom's '10 M3. I'm impressedby the reliability and performance of this car. Such a good investment. "
"Awesome CAR!  Ive had 3 Mustangs a 1993,2006 and my current 2010 Mustang Gt awesome Car.Its Better than the 2006 all the way.Bought both of them used had the 2006 for about 11months then found the 2010 Mustang Gt 4.6liter in Kona Blue,favorite color.I thought the 2006 was good the 2010 Mustang is Great handles better and it even has the track pack,heated seats and 19'wheels.I get stares at all the people who wished they had one.This car overall handles better drives quiet and if your use to a sports car ride ,its Allright with me.No kids in the back seats to mess up the leather and I keep the music Crankin.Allways wanted a Mustang since I was a kid Im on my 3rd one,this is the only car I'll drive FORD #1"
"Average car, Average price: It's a Ford.  I just purchased my 2010 Mustang V6 Automatic about 6 months ago, used, from a Ford dealer. The best part of this car is the looks, it's a very pretty car, and the interior has a nice look (though lacking in quality). The power is lacking. It drives and handles like a Toyota Camry; not what you would expect. This V6 is just a family sedan on a sports car platform, for a little over 20 grand, THAT is why the mustang is desirable. If you want overwhelming power or speed, then get the GT, the 'real' mustang.Long story short, I'd prefer a 2007 C230 over this, but, the Mustang is a nice vehicle."
"Ford's Character Machine is [non-permissible content removed]  I wanted a Mustang GT since I was 16. I was taking a walk around at my local dealer's lot while my Fusion was being serviced and seen the black on black 5 speed GT. I wasn't planning on buying at the time but with only 10k km (6200 miles) on it and a price tag of half of that of the new 'Stangs I was sold. This is a dream come true. The car feels very solid and sounds great. There is power in every gear and at any rev. Most importantly, the car has character, which is missing from all these new boring cars rolling out. I chose the 10's over the 11's because the 4.6 is tried and true. Also heard about issues with the new 6 speed. Best bang for the buck I ever spent on a car. "
Awesome Car  Bought this car as a leftover 2010 and got a grreat deal.The red candy metallic looks great with white stripes.This car is loaded and drives fantastically.On a recent drive (mostly highway driving) I was getting 26 miles to the gallon.I haven't found a thing to complain about yet.This is my 4th Stang and they just keep getting better. 
"Way Better Than a Camaro...  All I can say is WOW!  I had a 2010 Camaro RS for about 450 miles before realizing I'd made a mistake.  I saw my Grabber Blue GT sitting on the lot at a huge discount and that's all she wrote.  This is my first new Ford out of 76 cars in my life.  I really love the way it drives and handles.  I can only imagine what the 5.0 GT must be like.  I'll be fine with my tried and true 4.6 for now, but who knows down the road..."
"Perfected Pony 2005 to 2010 GT Series  First let me say, that if you own a 2005 to 2009 Mustang GT you own something truly unique.  I had a 2006 GT and a 2008 GT and in a way I wish I still had my 2006.  Here is why: the look, feel, sound, gauges, dash, air conditioning registers on these years were retro and perfect and will never be duplicated again.  Now about the 2010 GT, why would I buy a 2010 GT instead of a 2011?  Proven and Perfect Motor, Proven and Perfect 5 speed, Proven and perfect steering, you can use 87 octane, the car is too fast and too quick for 95% of urban driving.  What you have here is the perfected article.  The safest, most reliable, most proven design to date.  If you want the quickest get the 2011 5.0"
"Very good car  This car was used but only had 5000 miles on it when I bought it. It may just be a V6 but it has all the power you need. I love the way it handles and it makes the drive to work something I look forward to every day. On a highway trip it went 351 miles on 12 gallons of gas so I am happy with the mpg. I like this car so much I have just bought a used 2010 V6 Premium for my wife and she loves it, now i get to drive mine."
"2010 Ford Mustang V6  I bought my Mustang in April and it by far surpassed my expectations! I am 18 years old and this is one of the best purchases iv ever made. Everyone disses the V6 pony saying its a dog; I would argue til I'm blue in the face. I have outran V8s in my Mustang and the acceleration would make you think its a V8. Performance is good but what about handling? Its a rough riding car. I'm not gonna lie. Personally, I like it. I like feeling every bump in the road and knowing the terrain i'm on. But since its bumpy as crud, it turns like a sports car. I can take 40 mph turns at 75. Kinda scary but she'll take it! The outside looks somewhat retro but pretty cool. It's the inside that gets me. My color!"
"Good Mustang  I got it as my company car, so I couldn't choose the premium version.  The basic version lacks a lot of equipment and interior design of the premium and GT, so definitely get the more equipped versions.  To my surprise, the 4.0 is actually a pretty good engine for a daily driver, the engine has very good torque for off the line acceleration and it almost sounds like a V8.  Exterior Design is subjective but I honestly love it, unmistakably a Mustang.  Ride is a little rough over harsh roads and the back end is a bit jumpy, but hey it´s a mustang and all of them are like that."
"Get this car.  This car is just awesome.  The 4.6L V8 makes the car, and the stock exhaust has a nice rumble to it that screams when you mash the pedal to the floor.  I've had the car for 2 years and have about 52,000 miles on her with zero problems.  For the price, you really can't beat it either (16300 in 2009 with 33k miles). Its faster, better looking, and really just more of a car than any used BMW/mercedes within its pricing segment.  The only comparable competitor in the used car market this years Mustang has is in the 350z, which handles better but lacks in practicality.  And on top of that, the Z doesn't sound as good as the 8 and after test driving could be a nightmare as a daily driver"
"Buy It--New or Used (2005 or after)  I just bought a 2006 GT Conv with 13000 miles.  I've had it two days and already love it.  My other vehicle is a Mazda CX-9 (for the family).  This one is fun for me and I can still haul the family for fun trips.  With the GT (V8), I'm surprised that I'm averaging 20-23 mpg--not bad considering the 300 horses and irresitible urge to nail it and nail it and well you get the point.  Buy this vehicle.  If $ are tight, I recommend an 06 or 07--great bargains out there.  I personally chose a used GT instead of a new V6.  I would have considered a used 05, but I never get a car its first year in production--no idea if there's any real basis in that- -just my personal hangup."
"Back to Domestics after 20 years  First domestic I've owned in 20 years, love it! Build quality is superior, paint rivals any other mfg in the world! I have a base model with one option: 3.73 axle upgrade.  Very comfortable, love the engine sound tube into the interior, good economy considering 315 HP. I do lots of track days and it's very well balanced but quite underdamped, needs more shock damping. I've driven the ""Track Pak"" suspension on-track and it's worth the money, much better body control during cornering.  Only other complaint is the seat, not supportive for sporty driving and the lower cushion gets uncomfortable after 2 hours."
"V6 Has Plenty of ""Go""  I bought this 2010 model (black on black) ""used"" with 16,000 miles on it for my 17 year old, and got a great deal. The interior fit and finish is a huge improvement over older models.  I was a bit worried about the V6 but it's got plenty of zip, and I didn't want a V8 for a teenager.  The SYNC system is awesome and allows easy hands free cell phone use, but the best feature of all is the glass roof! It is gorgeous.  This car turns heads and handles very well. I may have to borrow it from her more often."
"What a car!  Run, don't walk to your Ford Dealer! This car ROCKS! I love this car! I have owned many muscle cars over the years and loved them all however this one is not only muscle cool but it is very modern cool!"
"I wish it were true  My 2010 GT Premium started life being scratched by the dealer before I got it.  That took 5 days in total to fix.  It now has less than 800 miles on it and it's been back in the shop twice.  This last time, it's been two weeks.  The problem was a major rattle coming from inside the dash.  Only solution was for dealer to replace dash.  Nearly two weeks and the dealer is waiting for the new dash to arrive from Ford.  By the time I get it back I'm sure the new car smell that it had will have been replaced by the smells usually found in a service department.  I wish I'd bought something else."
"Better seats and move the cupholders...  I've owned seven Mustangs over the years, from all but the first generation. This is by far my favorite. Everything about the car is outstanding except how well the seat holds me in place when accelerating through corners, and the location of the cup holders directly behind the shifter with the manual trans. Other than that Ford has fixed every single complaint I've ever had about any of the other Mustangs I've owned over the years, an amazing car, Ford's best yet."
"Great V6 You'll Love  The 2011 V6 Mustang gets all the love these days with its new engine.  But my 2010 V6 is a dream--fun to drive and in Kona Blue with the Pony Package, a real eye-catcher.  I was a German car snob for 20 years and had some very solid BMW's and a fun little C230 Benz.  Now, I'm hooked on the design, styling and solid performance of my Mustang.  I don't doubt the 2011's are even better, but don't believe anybody who tries to diminish the 2010's.  Just drive one and decide for yourself.     "
"2010 GT Black on Black  This car is awesome, there is not much more I can say. It is fast and gets reasonable highway mileage around 24- 25. It fun to drive and the Mustang always gets admiring looks. I have just over 7k of totally trouble free miles so far. I have owned more than 30 new cars in the last 40 years and this one is by far my favorite and it may even stay in my garage for more than my average of 24 months."
"The BEST car I've ever owned  Id love to upgrade to the 2011 just for increased horsepower/mpg. I love this car absolutely no problems! I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee 06 and compared to the mustang it is no match. I never realized how unreliable the jeep was until I got an actual reliable car that never has problems (my mustang). The Ford service (only used for oil changes) are so helpful and sweet. The car handles amazingly and the seats are so comfortable. I love my SYNC system! This car is reliable, fun to drive, and beautiful. No complaints "
"Smooth  Use to own 1989 5.0 love the car but too many races, and got older, had to give it up, but now more mature I love the 2010 model, could have a little more power boost but hey still can beat all at light. Handles well, but when going over bumps at high rate of speed, can be a little touchy, need to give buyers back seat floor mats, and lights on visor, and glove box. 5 speed a little stiff, but can live with it, wife wants to drive, that's why I got the 5 speed, only will use for summer, put up for winter"
"2010 Kona Blue GT  Car runs perfectly, great options.  Build quality is flawless.  A/C required recharging at 1000 miles due to loose fitting, now works 100%.  Fit & finish excellent.  Car is extremely quiet."
"Why did I wait so long to buy?  After searching all the competitors out there, including the German and Japanse cars, how could anyone not consider a Mustang? I bought a GT convertible. Wow, for the money this car has no peer. Right out of the box the power and handling of this car are fantastic. To think I can get add-on accessories to boost this performance to even higher levels without breaking the bank is even better. Top down driving is fun. Your passengers in the back may ask you to roll up the windows on the freeway, but in the front seats the wind is manageable. The family loves the car and want to take it everywhere. Four seats. Great stereo with excellent bass response. Very comfortable seats (I'm over 6') too."
Exterior & Handling great  I was shopping for Lexus & Lincoln. I owned three Lincoln Mark V111. They do not make coups anymore. Lexus Toyota still has stigma of accelerator problems. Mustang is fun to drive. I may have to sacrifice Suspension comfort of Lexus E350. But Lexus looks are not appealing.You may want to improve interior & quality of trunk carpet.
"I'm a Chevy guy  I'm a hard core Chevy guy and have been waiting for the right time to buy a new Camaro. I've driven both the V6 and the V8 Camaro but something left me wanting and all the used Camaros on the dealer lots worried me.  Out of curiosity I test drove the Mustang 2011 V6 and the current GT.  The GT won hands down, it was pure love at first sight.  The interior design was fantastic, the gadgets are cool, it's easier to drive and it's just an all out blast to drive."
"Best bang for the buck!  This car was not even on my list when I set out shopping.  But after incentives it was almost half price of anything else I was looking at.  I really like the dash, sequential turn signals, the retro look, and the lack of a fuel cap.  It's fun to drive the mileage is decent and varies according to how you drive it. as low as 18 and as high as 23.  No long open freeway driving yet.  For a sports car it is comfortable and very stable on the road it corners very well.  The ride is stiff but still refined.  I'm surprised and pleased with this car!  "
"Step In The Right Direction  20 years since my '86LX 5.0.  Just bought a 2010 GT.  This is a huge improvement with solid handling, strong and flexible V8 with a fantastic sound. I ordered 3.73 gears with a manual trans which do not disappoint.  I knew mileage would suffer, but I like the extra push in the back.  Interior is very nice with a clean layout and comfortable seats.  Very quiet and composed in normal driving.   It's not a sports car and not an all out drag car(though it's plenty quick), but it is the original pony car, the best iteration to date, and the most enjoyable car I've driven under $30k."
Wheel well covers rattle!  I love my grabber blue mustang.  The only issue I have with the car is the rattling noise coming from the wheel well covers.  My dealership let me take out a few 2010 models like mine and they do the same thing.  A review was sent into the Ford Co.  Other then that I have no issues on wet pavement or massive puddles here in FL.  
"Solid performance for any decade  First mustang was a 96 gt black with saddle interior. This is incomparable. The classic look of a 69, or 70 with subdue design for the tail lights and spoiler. Unique. Have to opt for the 5 speed manual, GT premium, and saddle interior with ambient lighting, shaker 1000 audio, accompanied by Microsoft SYNC. Upgraded rims and the candy apple red look great on the outside, while the lighter interior adds comfort and contrast. And performance without falter, put the advance trac in sport mode and smoke a couple of imports. With a growl from the exhaust that could only previously be heard with aftermarket upgrade. Thank you ford. "
The  Engine Roars  Own a 2007 sweet 350z convertible and it is quick and nimble. But when you own/ride a 2010 gto Jet black. American made muscle car whose engine roars and thunders down the road then you know you are in a mustang!
"Best of both worlds.  Absolutely love my Ford Mustang! I have the premium V6 w/pony package, comfort package, and security package. This car offers a big luxury car ride complete with lots of luxury items, while handling like the sports car that it is. Classic sports car look and a true gem to drive. "
"Safe solid sane sporty sexy  Dear car magazines: the next time you compare any car to the 2010 mustang v6 set the following standards 1) hepa filtration air conditioning 2) five star safety rating on all tests 3) zero to sixty in less than 7 seconds 4) a car the gets looks, thumbs up, and compliments every single day you drive it. Guess how many cars will show to the comparo. The one the only the mustang if you want to take a $23,000 car to enter into a nascar race, or 150 mph at the track, or drag it. Of course forget the v6, but if you want the coolest, safest, tightest, heavy duty, reliable, union and American made muscle car with a 45 year track record buy the mustang v6.  No blind spots, no gas cap, no worries.  "
"Mixed bag  Having put 9K on the car, here is what Ive come away with so far: The 6 cyl is solid and steady, but feels lethargic at times.  The engine response is reminiscent of a pickup truck, and even the manual tranny does little to remedy this.   Doing 80 on the freeway in a straight line, the car feels planted to the pavement, but if you hit any sort of uneven surface while turning above 30 mph, the experience is unsettling for both the car and driver.  If the pavement is anything but bone dry, the Stang needs skill and a steady hand.  With the V8 and the suspension you get, the GT is certainly worth the extra few K.  "
Waiting for the Camaro  Couldnt wait for the Camaro so I bought a Mustang GT convertible.  I am not greatly impressed with the 300 HP.  I would have bought a Shelby except for the $25K upcharge
"Great Car!  I have a Mercedes Benz E350, and just bought the Mustang. I can honestly say the Mustang is more fun to drive! Fuel economy could have been better, but the actual fuel costs are lower than the MB, as the Mustang takes regular unleaded (you can make your own comparisons at fueleconomy.gov). Overall, I am very pleased. I am also proud to be driving an American car, and an icon at that."
"love my stangs!  This is my 6th mustang gt, so i would say i know a lot about them! i love mustangs as my first car was a 1999 mustang gt! this 2010 is my first BRAND NEW mustang and i am thrilled i got a 2010 grabber blue mustang gt premium with the track pack! it has every option you can get minus the glass roof! i love it!"
"Eye Turner  Traded in a 2005 V6 for the 2010 V8. As expected I was not disappointed. I shopped hard to find this car with the #4 accessory package which has the hood scoop and pedestal spoiler. Couple that with the candy apple red exterior and the 401A red interior and this car turns heads. The HID headlights,Shaker 1000 stereo.ambient lighting are must haves. This car rocks. Did my time with the minivans, SUV and 4 door sedans. The kids are gone and Dad is cruising."
"BEST CAR, HANDS DOWN  I have a 5-speed boy-toy!  It is fast, pretty, and comfortable.  This car will fly low and feel good at the same time.  I got the updated interior (in red). It rides smooth, yet handles better than my old sports car.  The interior features are much better than past mustangs; it is almost luxury grade.  It is the best car I have ever owned in my 55 years.  I tested BMWs, infinitis, mazdas, mitsubishis, audis, and lots more.  Nothing, save a porsche (which costs twice as much) comes close in ""fun-to-drive"" and full features.  The only let down was gas mileage, but what can you expect from a V-8 that has to be driven fast?!"
"I love it  In 26 years of driving and owning fast car but never a Ford that has been a mistake. I love my new ride, it came with the Track package. Makes the ride a bid bumpy but the handling is great, very direct and sporty with the perfect engine power and great sound. In relation to the bucks paid for it could not wish for more. Real aluminum interior and nice leather seats, short shift stick, great car"
Mustang GT  Bought my GT in July and have driven it now for 6 months. Love this car. Sounds great and gets second looks wherever I go. Candy Apple Red with the red leather interior is really sharp. The ambient interior lighting is cool-I like the ice blue. Shaker 1000 stereo is more than I need but what the heck. The factory hood scoop and pedestal spoiler set this car apart from the other GT's on the lot. Probably should have waited for the 2011 with 400 horses but I am having fun with this car.
Sweet Ride  I drove 150 miles to find this car. From the moment I drove it I loved it. Could not make a deal the first trip but on November 30 the dealership got what I wanted. I love the heated seats and power driver and passenger front seats. Lots of power as I zoomed past my buddy in his 94 corvette. Love the sync and the sat radio. The interior is beautiful. The handling is great
Ford Mustang eats Volvo S40  I have been driving a Volvo S40 for 9 years and had so many problems yet wanted to get my money out of it.  Finally decided to face facts and ditch the four-banger.  I was glad to see Ford still made a good American product for a reasonable price.  Considered several models but just fell in love with the 2010 Mustang Premium V-6 automatic.  You can't beat its looks both inside and outside.  Good attention to detail and the standard equipment with the Premium model is great.  I can't believe how much fun it is to drive and the SYNC and Shaker systems are very cool.  The sequential tail lights remind me of the old Thunderbirds.  My Mustang was $200 under invoice plus $2k cash back & 4%. WOW!
"Off the HOOK!!!  Fantastic machine!  I have been a Ford fan for a while now, and have been patiently waiting for my chance to buy a Mustang; I am NOT dissapointed.  Oh - and do not listen to the folks that say to wait for the '11s - this car has more power than a normal human being requires on today's roads!!!  The car handles extremely well, and the five-speed is a dream to operate.  Ford has also executed the redesigned and upgraded interior in such a way as to put most 'luxury cars' to shame!  I liked the new 2005 Mustang, but this car is off the charts in execution, fun, and excitement.  Heads are turning wherever I go - a very cool feeling.  Rock on, Ford!!! "
"Outstanding Vehicle  After purchasing my GT, i have to say is WOW!!!!!.  My wife originally wanted the car but after driving on the Autobahn in Germany.  I just have to say WOW.  The car is very powerful from what i remembered back in the early 90's and the throaty exhaust sound is earth shattering.  Every where we drive in it, the stares and the mouths dropping on the pavements is awesome.  Also, i am learning more and more what this car can do everyday as well.  My GT is also Kona Blue but has with it a white racing stripe.  In my opinion, Ford has done a magnificent job from the days of the 90's when they produced not so good vehicles.  My hat is off to the guys in the oval blue company. Job well done."
"Who says you can't go back?  Purchased the car privately about 6 weeks ago, and have had a blast with it since!  A few road trips, taken my 2 boys and their friends for rides, just a real fun experience. I've had about a dozen cars (and even a few trucks) revving engines and wanting to race. Also had lots of comments on the ""nice ride"", one fellow with a PT cruiser convertable even made an offer to buy it at a stop light!  I had a 77 Cobra back when, and I have to admit you really can go back with this car.  If you want to have fun, you can't really go wrong with this ride. "
"Great vehicle!!!!!  I set out to get a fuel efficient vehicle along the line of a Malibu or Fusion.  My wife thought we should get something more FUN.  I had settled on the 6 cylinder Mustang and she talked me into the GT.  Th day after I got it I traveled to Toronto which was about 500 miles round trip.  Driving it at about 72mph the whole way, I averaged about 28mpg.  Not bad!!!  The car is great.  It is very comfortable.  The power is great.  The SYNC is awesome.  I am learning more and more everyday of its capabilities.  I got the GT Premium with a 5 spd manual.  The color is Kona Blue.  The car gets looks everywhere and I cannot get gas without someone asking me about it.  Great car.  Great Value!"
"Don't even miss my BMW 335i Twin Turbo  Black on Black GT premium coupe, automatic, 19 inch wheels, comfort package with heated seats. I am very impressed with this car and after coming out of a BMW that is saying a lot. I feel proud to be supporting an American Company and especially when they are building cars like this. The engine sound is intoxicating. The overall feel behind the wheel will take you back to your more youthful self. I am 6'5"" and a big guy and I have no problems fitting in the car comfortably. Everyone wants to compare this car to the Camaro but have you sat in one? They should be ashamed to make such an ugly interior plus Ford did not take any bail out money! I now own 2 2010 Fords and love the direction."
"I love it !!  Waited nearly 3 months for car to be built & delivered, but it was worth the wait!! Amazing looks, performance better than expected and very comfortable to drive. My first mustang, and bought the manual. Shift is a little stiff, but has got better and lots more fun to drive than an auto. Car handles well, sticks to the road and no under steer. Acceleration excellent, especially if you make use of gears. SYNC system is neat - but complicated. Like the USB and phone dialling and Shaker system is top.  Only very minor niggle is the cupholder gets in the way when you shift gears... but I'll live with it!!!"
Utah John  Special order with many options. Auto is crisp and car is very fun to drive. The look of the glass roof from the inside out is worth the money. Many positive comments on overall look of car. Exhaust note has a neat rumble. Driving down the road if feels like a million bucks and solid as can be. Compared to a Camero and debated long and hard between the two but from inside out there is no doubt this is by far the better car. Much nicer interior and one can actually see outside. I waited many years saving my money to buy this car and it was worth all the time.
"New '10  Traded in '08 GT for new '10.  Quite a bit different.  Exterior is sleeker and interior is worlds better. Materials are much better, very quiet inside (until you step on it).  Even turn signal is a significant improvement. Not really any faster, but definitely handles better.  Friend just got SS Camaro.  It is faster, but feels much bigger than Mustang on the road and more cramped inside (I am 6'1"")."
"Best Mustang yet!  I've driven many Mustangs in my life.  This is by far the best quality Mustang ever.  The power is there when you need it, it's comfortable (we took a 3,000 mile trip in it).  The ride quality is unmatched when coupled with what it can do in corners.  Fuel mileage is more than adequate as well.  Trunk space is very good for a Mustang, not full size car worthy, but sufficient.  I'm very impressed with the Shaker audio system and the SYNC system is beyond cool!"
"Fantastic drive!  Just got the car two days ago and I'm still loving it. The V6 has pep but is a tad slow, and the attention to detail is amazing.  The car handles very smoothly and responds to my touch when I want it to. The interior accent lighting (user customizable) and touches make it fun to show off, and the heated seats up here in the cold cold north were a great option. I get turned heads everywhere I go with the pony upgrade and racing stripes.  The SYNC definitely takes some time to get used to - I still haven't figured out how to hang up a call. The Sat. radio, iPod connection, and 6-disc changer means you never run out of music and media. All in all a great car to own."
"Simply Amazing !!  Our first Mustang --> A 2010 GT Premium, black on black, with Aluminium Machine bright 19 inch wheels, HID light, navigation, rear camera ok, ok one word  it is a - masterpiece (had to wait for 7.5 weeks to get one). Have owned Hondas and Toyotas earlier, Hondas are good, Toyotas are crap (bad experience and hence the opinion). Bottomline, never knew Fords were that good, wasted few years of my life by not driving one earlier. My highschooler is eagerly waiting to get his license and drive it. My 4 year olds just wants to be dropped off to school in the Mustang. Power, the roaring sound, head turner, great handling, the super cool indicators enough said I must say, it is --> Simply Amazing!!"
Head turner  Have had Carmeros and firebirds over the years including 67 bird 400 and 68ss 396 both hot tire burners. in the three weeks i owner of this basic automatic car the dark blue and 68 style has turned more heads the all the others. could be a little quicker shifting soft ride with firm handling gas mileage should be better but ok avg 20 well priced fun car- i think the grand daughter has her eyes on it in the next few years- great ride for two -kids only in the back-they don't mind they are in the cool ride. I will drive it in the northeast winter but the weight seems to be close to 50/50 should not be a problem enjoy ford better idea well priced
"My Dream Car   I took delivery my dream car a Kona Metallic Blue Mustang GT Premium coupe 3 days ago. This color is amazing, beautiful metallic blue in the sun, purple at dusk or dawn, and black at night. I purchased the comfort package, security package, HID headlights, manual transmission, & Track-Pak option. As you can imagine the handling is phenomenal! The engine horsepower is more than enough for the average driver. However,as a performance enthusiast not enough power for me. The interior has excellent quality, with great ergonomics. I love the aesthetics, from Sync to My Color to the quiet comfortable interior. The audio system has a surprisingly great sound."
"Best Mustang Ever  First had a '67, and of course regret ever getting rid of it. Bought this as a leftover in December 06 for a steal, loaded with rebates, dealer concessions, etc.  Best buy in a car ever.  Solid as a rock.  Fast, and the sweetest engine rumble.  Handles exceptionally well, and goes almost as quick as my supercharged 01 Jag XKR.  Rougher, more raw power, but it adds to fun.  Amazingly solid for a conv.   A truly fantastic value with auto, premium everything, etc.  Great car.  Tempts me to get rid of my Jag and match this conv with an 08 fully loaded GT coupe!"
"""Funtagious""  I have owned new GT Mustangs in the years of 91, 93, 94, 96, 04, and now 2010. I must say, Ford has finally devoted the attention to the Mustang that it deserves.  The car simply handles amazingly, quite agile, and has the power needed to make it fun!  The interior is impressive, especially the ambient lighting. The stereo sounds fantastic. I really can not come up with any suggestions for improvement.  Take a drive, you will be ""hooked""!  "
"awesome car  I love this car,crossed shopped it  against the competition,the mustang won on price,and the fun to drive experiance.I have two boys who are already fighting who will drive it first,and they have a few years to go.Still early to have a say about fuel milage but you don't get a mustang for the fuel milage. "
"Base Mustang  Getting 20mpg driving in Northern VA traffic. HWY MPG GREAT - 435 miles on 14 gallons = 30mpg with ac on. FRPP Exhaust installed. Handling is still a little loose, looking at upgraded shocks and brakes.I got mine for just under 20k, 7k less than the GT. The V8 would be a nice option in the base. V6 has a lot of potential - look at the Shelby Terlingua V6 mustang.  V6 insurance rates are great - less to insure than my old 2007 Rabbit"
"2010 Mustang GT with 3.73 rear axle pack  I got the GT (not Premium) with 3.73 rear axle package which came with better brakes and sportier stability programming.  My 08 335i was repurched by BMW due to repetitive faulty high pressure fuel pump.  So got a Stang to ride out the economy.  The engine's power, torque, and sound are more fun than a 335's.  Handling is shameful however..very loose and bouncy front to back and side to side.  I find it necessary to spend $2k extra to upgrade the supension from 2005-FR3 package..which lowers the car and tighens things up.  I hope that helps.  Steering feel is light and dead numb unfortunately.  Steering wheel is also to big.. Still, Engine makes up alot..Very Fun Car!   "
"First Impressions  Great sound when accelerating. This Torch Red sports car has given me more compliments in the form of teenagers hovering around ""gaga"" to oldsters knowing it is a 2010 and asking how I like it.  What's not to like?  The road feel is superb and the quiet ride is comparable to my Lincoln.  700 mile road trip during first month of ownership resulted in comfortable smooth travel and easy to operate dials for keeping attention to road.  I am confident that the upcoming weeks will reveal complete satisfaction with my purchase.  The ""Wow Factor"" of ""10"" is a pleasure also. "
Awesome  Had the car 2 days now.  Very nice.. fund to drive.  Acceleration is great... sounds great too.  
"WOW!!!!  Specs - Kona Blue GT premium coupe, automatic, 19 inch wheels, comfort & security package, HID headlights.  Ford finally got it right with the interior - no more plastic - it is real aluminum now.  The whole interior, from Sync to MyColor is great.  The Shaker 500 audio system is surprising good.  The gauges are laid out well and the car has good console storage space for a sports car.  Also, the trunk has a lot more room than you think and the back seats fold down for more room.  At 6'2"", I fit very comfortably in the car and have ample leg room.  The automatic seats are easy to use.  It would be wise to check out the new Mustang before getting anything else in this category."
"Long time Honda buyer goes with a GT  This is the first Ford product I have owned in 20 years and I have to say that Ford has made serious progress.   I have casually considered GT Mustangs for the past 10 years - I wanted that V- 8 engine - but was put off by many things.  Among other things, the poor quality and ergonomics of the interior, the cheap black side mirrors, and rather bland handling.  But I guess Ford finally listened to Consumer Reports.  The interior is 200% improved over previous models and they finally put body-colored side mirrors on the car.  The handling, however, is what really shocked me.  It is on par with my Acura TL.  The engine, of course, is what this car is about. It will not disappoint. "
"First Sports Car  I must put the review in perspective.  My wife allowed me to have a sporty car since the kids are all grown.  We purchased a GT Premium coupe, however, the vehicle is upgraded with a Roush 427R package.  I don't see any reviews on Edmunds about the Roush, but I must say this vehicle is worth the upgrade.  After talking to someone who used to work for the SVT at Ford, the Roush is a much better overall than the Cobra.  With 435 hp and 400 torque, this a dream car to drive and the handling is remarkable.  The regular GT Premium was enjoyable to drive, but if you can get the Roush you won't be disappointed.  Mine is a short throw 5-speed Grabber Blue with flat black accents and great seats."
"Best overall Mustang I've owned  I'm no stranger to Mustangs as this is the 4th Mustang GT I've owned.  This car may lack the grunt of a Camaro SS, but it makes up for it in every other department.  The interior is excellent in quality, ergonomics & aesthetics.  It's the most quiet & comfortable cabin of any Mustang I've owned.  I would not have paid extra for the My Color feature, but it came with the car.  I do have to admit though, now that I have it I really enjoy it.  The handling is phenomenal.  You can really wring the car out even with the traction control on.  The power is not bad.  It's more than enough for the average driver.  However, as a performance enthusiast, I wish it were more competitive with a Camaro SS."
"Mid-life fantasy  I bought a convertible before I got too old to appreciate it, and I'm glad I did. My grandkids complain I'm too old to be driving such a hot car. Car is an absolute blast to drive, head and shoulders better than my 2000 GT coupe. Car looks super with top down, and I frequently get compliments. Power top has been trouble-free, no leaks to date. Biggest issue I have is interior squeaks/rattles I never had with my 2000 GT, which are annoying when top is up. Shaker 500 stereo is nice but I'm not sure speakers are suited to it. Rear defrost switch is in awkward position, hard to operate/see when in 5th gear. Using cupholders can make shifting awkward. Still, a tremendous value, super to drive."
"Absolutely Amazing!  Just picked up a Kona Blue GT this week, and I am absolutely amazed.  The car handles like a dream and has power to spare.  Only have a couple hundred miles on it so far, but so far so good!  I looked at this, the Camero and the Challenger...IMO the Mustang is much more refined than any of them.  It may lack in the power department, but it still have plenty of gitty-up in her.  The gas millage is actually very good for a V8, I am getting about 21 mixed highway and city, so no complaints there."
Great car  This car reminds me of my 1964 Mustang. The only difference is this is far more reliable and Powerful with better handling
the white beauty  All these cars have a problem with the AC compressor. Ford should recall on this part because is a problem with all the 2010 mustang and is very expensive.
"Love this car!  I recently bought a 2010 Mustang Convertible (base V6 automatic).What an awesome ride! It has more than enough power to get me into trouble, and is an absolute beauty.The lines are amazing.I'd recommend it to anyone."
"Not my father's 66' Mustang Coupe..  It's motor (4.6) is smaller than dads old 289 cu in. with the 2 bbl carburetor.And it's an electric Grabber Blue color w/black cloth top - which always looks better when not sitting on a car lot.I keep it garaged and only drive it on nice days.Loads of looks and compliments on the street.It's actually an automatic (not offered in Model review selection info by Edmunds) and it works perfectly for a vehicle made in summer of 2009.Wife gave it to me as a 25th anniversary present.It surprising how nice this vehicle is, and the sound it makes is just right.No tickets, anddrive it with traction control activated.An ounce of Image is worth a pound of performance."
"First Mustang and First Convertible!  I have always wanted a convertible, and could never find one I really liked.I recently started test driving the Pontiac G6, and Chrysler Sebring;they could not even compare to how the mustang convertible drove.I love my car (black body, black top, and black interior).It is so sleek looking, and when I drive by with the top down people just stop and stare.Super fun car to drive, and I fit my friends in there perfectly.Definitely recommend!"
"This is the Car iv'e been looking for  This the best car i have ever owned. It is black on black and I love to drive it. I have never gotten so many complements on a car before. when I put the top down people just stop and stare. I test drove a lot of convertibles before my wife suggested the Mustang it was the last one I test drove, got it that same day. Did I say I love driving it. I have become a Mustang Man.    "
"I absolutely love this car!  The new styling is perfect. This car (triple black) gets stares and comments almost every time I drive it. It's comfortable, extremely hot looking, fast, nimble, and the sound from the pipes is music. Build quality is fine, price is reasonable, and I fit my whole family in it. What else can you ask for? I could only rate 'fun to drive' a max of 10, but I would have given it a 15. There are many accessories out there to personalize it and further improve performance so it'll never 'get old'. The premium fuel is worth the extra cost. Glad I didn't wait for the 2011. The 4.6 is plenty powerful and a tried and true performer, while the 5.0 needs a few years of reliability history under its belt. "
"2010 GT Premium convertible  For the past 10 years, I've been driving a BMW 330 convertible, Audi A4 V6 and Porsche 964 but my '10 GT Mustang is most fun of all. Had to install the FR3 handling pack to tighten it up but awesomely enjoyable now. 315 hp is enough to move it around in any gear (5-spd manual), even with a 3:31 rear gear. 18 mpg around town. Tight build quality. Grabber blue w/1970 Mach 1 hood stripes. Topped it off with Saleen 20"" wheels. "
"Some Say Sports Car - I Say Roadster  I bought the premier V6 convertible with the pony package because I did not believe I required a Hi- performance sports car.  After thorough research, I decided on the V6 and consider a roadster.  In that category, it is a great vehicle that, in my opinion, out paces its competition in most areas.  It is fun to drive and invokes pleasant responses from other people. "
"Droptop fun  Excellent all round fun to drive car. Our V6 is equiped with the optional Pony package. This really helps out in the handling dept with added rear anti- sway bar, ABS,and 17"" alloy rims. Take one for a drive. You'll love it."
"GT Convertible  This is my first Mustang and have enjoyed it so far. Great looking Kona Blue metallic paint, awesome V8 sound, and handles well for it's size and weight. Gets lots of looks and compliments. Everybody likes this car. Except remorseful Camaro owners."
"Love My Car  My Mustang was special ordered just for me.  The car is everything I knew it would be and more.  This is the second convertible mustang I have owned.  The first was in 1984. Now 26 years later I have another one.  Love the my color ambient lighting, love the sync and navigation, love the backup camera.  Color choice was white w/a black top and one of the striping packages also in black. I'm averaging 19 city and 24+ highway. I was thinking the mpgs would be a little better being that it is only a V6 engine but it's still new and not broke in yet.  I am so happy with my car.  I did a lot of research before I made my decision, and I couldn't have picked a better car. LOVE-LOVE-LOVE IT"
"Childhood DREAM, came TRUE!!!!  My whole life, I have dreamed of owning a convertible, but never thought that day would come. Finally at Thirty years old, that day came TRUE. I researched all the different models of convertibles, and none of the others compared to the Ford Mustang. The Mustang rated the highest in safety, which was one of my main concerns. Another was the comfort and room for passengers, and again the Mustang had it all.  "
"Love My Car  I've had my car for three weeks, V6 convertible Black on Black. I have never gotten so many looks and compliments about a car before. The styling is great the ride is fun, this is my first Mustang. Looked at other convertibles, but this one I had to have.   "
"2010 Mustang GT Premium Convertible  Just bought the car new a few weeks ago. Have been enjoying it ever since. Lots of compliments on the car, especially the color -Kona Blue metallic. Plenty of power, decent comfort and handles surprisingly well for its size. Nice stereo. Sync system works well but takes a while to figure out."
210 mustang  We have several mustangs but this is the boss of them all. Love the design and the handling of the car.  Love the microsoft synch.  Car is fun to drive and great to look at...
"Way to go Ford  Well my wife traded in her mountaineer for a mustang.  Having her midlife crisis.  She got the V6 premium with automatic and convertible.  She also had the GT stripe installed over the hood and trunk.  The color of the car is Kona blue.  Very sharp looking and we get looks where ever we go.  Car is well put together and solid.  Ford really addressed past weakeness in the car.  Car gets good mileage on the highway.  We went out to Pa on business with straight open highway driving and the car got 26 MPG doing 70.  Not bad for less than a 1,000 miles on the car.  If someone is looking for a two door sports coupe they should look at this first before going to the imports."
"2010 Mustang Convertible  I just got this 2010 vehicle on Monday, July 6, 2009.  I have always wanted a yellow convertible since I was 5 years old.  I'm now 71 and I must say my Sunset Gold Mustang is all I hoped it would be.  It's like driving a big computer, so much to learn about the car.  However, it is very comfortable and easy to drive.  It has a lot of pick-up for a V6 and I love the Sirrus Radio.  I really don't know what else to say escept it's the fun car to drive, especially with the top down whether you are 20 or a Senior Citizen."
"Great value -  Muscle Car Classic  I test drove a mustang convertible 16 years ago but put off the purchase because of the insurance cost.  16 years later I finally purchased a 2010 gt prem conv(one of the benefits of getting old...lower insurance costs) and could not be happier.  This car is true American muscle car; its powerful, fun to drive and a great value.  The cons (axle, handling.....) are all shortcomings I can live with.  So if you are in the market for a muscle car I would highly recommend this car.  I considered buying a  late 60's early 70's muscle car but decided that the Mustang would give me the same thrill/feel without the hassle of dealing with an ongoing restoration project."
Great car to Drive  Drives great for a six cylinders - great pick up and go - good mileage - nice looking and it only requires routine maintenance.
"Great Car  I've had my 'stang for about a year. Living in the north east, it's garaged for the winter, but spring is only a month away!  I can't wait to park my Jeep and get back out in my Mustang. "
"Still getting compliments wherever we go  All the value estimates at every major web pretty much set up the same. These sites are all perfect for estimating the value of the normal everyday car purchased from a dealer except for a few important things that aren't covered. For instance how do you check off having to have the engine replaced at 15,000 mi on a car you have for sale with any odometer indicating 55,000 mi.? How do you check off that you purchased several expensive performance packages for better power, control,  millage,  safety ect.? There isn't any where to figure these in. This list is not all inclusive and i believe there are allot of car owners with similar situations. This is the situation im in at the present time.  So in using one of these webs they can only help provide foundation price the rest is guess work and left up you."
"Still a strong muscle car  This Mustang replaced a 2007 which was a good car. The 2012 is more refined across the board. Besides expected replacement parts like tires, batteries and wiper blades, plus scheduled oil changes, it has never been back to the dealer. It only has 34K miles on it and the black exterior and interior are still like new. I also keep the car in a garage when not on the road. I get lots of compliments even know."
"Jp5rocket  Excellent automatic but wished I went Manual soon after getting to know the car. If your going to buy performance, what else can I say.          New suspension, brakes, tires and DuPont paint, 79000 and running strong. Still have to take a few every time I get out of the car."
"Fun Until Parts Start Breaking  This is a fun car. Great acceleration and top speed. Hugs the road nicely. Car looks and sounds great! I've had this Mustang for 5 years now. Struts started going out after 3 years, I still haven't fixed that. The A/C and clutch broke very soon after the bumper to bumper warranty ended. Cost about $1,500 to fix. I went online and this was a common issue in the 30,000+ mile range. Now, right after the 5 year engine warranty ended, the water pump is going out. Replacing that and the hoses is going to cost me another $1,000 if I do it at a dealer.                      WARNING: Worst of all with this car. If I had know this I wouldn't have purchased the car. The heat in Arizona is hard on batteries, once you get acid on the battery cable, it will get inside the wiring and slowly eat its way through everything until all your electronics are burned out too. Luckily I caught it before it damaged anything. It's a special cable that you can only get from the dealer and they have to drop the transmission to replace it. $1,000 to replace that. I asked the dealer and a local about other options and how to avoid it in the future. They said this faulty cable is the only option on the Mustang, and you can only slow the problem down, but that I'll probably be back in in 5 years with the same problem. ITS A BATTERY CABLE! I love driving this car but I'm tempted to sell it and never look back. A battery cable should cost $20 and be a do-it-yourself project, not some $1,000 ordeal."
"Beautiful Car For It's Day  The car in white, immaculately detailed, with it's classic lines made for a head turned all the five years I owned it.  Great for straight line runs, mediocre handling in the curves, wonderful exhaust note.  Good all around gas mileage around town and better on the highway.  Stock Michelin tires prone to blowout at highway speeds (2 in under 23K miles) and gave good traction in wet conditions.   Wonderful brakes.  Speed limited at 112 MPH.  Not the best as far as reliability with throttle body replacement at 20K miles, complete HVAC under-dash replacement at 18K miles, and front lower control arms went bad at 16K miles.  This is an old school car that is lovely and fun to drive.  It doesn't compare well to the next generation that replaces it as they are entirely different animals."
Mustang GT Premium - Grabber Blue  
"Fun, but room for DIY improvements  Bang for buck a Mustang is never going to disappoint and I managed to snap up a 2012 GT Premium with only 1000 miles, and (as far as I can correlate) all the options barring the glass roof and California Special package. I've had it about 18 months now and got fed up with the sloppy shifter. Having replaced it with a Barton short shifter (and also replacing the shifter bracket with the Barton 2 post shifter bracket), it's a much better drive (this shifter and bracket are also sold under the Ford Racing brand, Barton has the manufacturing contract).
 I've had a few minor trim issues (e.g. button fell off the steering wheel), but no mechanical problems."
"Top down and loving  Being a native Californian, I have always wanted a convertible sports car. I recently sold my BMW 330ci coupe( not a convertible) and purchased my 2012 mustang convertible, This car is fast, responsive and absolutely a blast to drive!"
"Mustang: They Never Disappoint   I owned a 2010 Mustang before this one and loved it.However, I wasn't the biggest fan of it's manual gearbox--it felt slow and it wasn't smooth.I bought my 2012 Mustang nearly brand new and it is extremely improved! This car is very quick for a V6.I have raced my friends 2014 V6 Camaro many times and blow it out of the water every time.I am more than impressed with its performance. It's also a beautiful design. If I go 67-70 mph freeway I have always gotten between 34-36 mpg--I know, sounds almost unrealistic, but it's not.I have tested it multiple times by dividing miles driven into gallons filled up with.These are amazing cars, indeed. "
"so far so good  I bought my mustang premium v6 with the MCA package new.I have had it for 15 months (15,000 miles).So far no issues.The car runs perfectly smooth and powerful.This is my second new mustang and this one is a huge improvement over the last one.Much more fun to drive, 305hp is sweet, brake and handling is a lot better also.On the highway I can get 30mpg.The 6th gear is a little weak so I rarely get to 6th gear unless I am coasting on the highway.Ford sync works really well with my iPhone.I have the manual and the cup holder is useless since I need the room to shift gear.I would recommend this car to anyone who enjoy driving (fast and fun) but doesnÂt need a lot of room since"
"Most Fun for the Dollar  Start-up sound makes you swoon. Exterior styling is perfect. Interior comfort (front seats only) is impeccable. Performance is fabulous. As you can tell, this car is all about emotion.  I drove it to Florida in late November with plans to stop halfway for the night. But the car was so much fun to drive that I kept going. Twenty hours later I reached my destination and still wanted to keep driving.  Of the 51 vehicles that have passed through my hands in the last thirty-five years, this is the most enjoyable.  Note: With only 8300 miles, and being stored during the winter, I cannot truthfully report on longer-term reliability."
"Good car, serious safety flaws  This is a great car, with a huge potential flaw.I, as well as others, have experienced a crucial flaw in the stability control system on some 2011 and 2012 Mustangs.The stability control has a tendency on some vehicles to engage itself at around 50MPH for about 15-20 seconds.During this time, the car cuts throttle, and engages the brakes - and can cause the car to buck, sway, and behave violently.Ford has yet to acknowledge this issue or supply a fix."
"The best mustang ever  I've had my 2012 GT premium for about a year and a half now and it has been absolutely FLAWLESS from day 1.The manual transmission is smooth as butter, the car accelerates like a missile, the candy red metallic paint is mesmerizing in the sunlight and the interior (especially with saddle leather) rivals European quality (my wife has a 2010 Audi A4 and we both agree the mustang's interior design/quality is superior)I feel like I have sacrificed NOTHING with this car and that's the first time I've ever felt that way about owning any car.The back seats are JUST big enough to fit 2 average sized adults and the trunk holds JUST enough luggage & fuel economy is mid 20's mixed hwy/city."
"6 Months In  I have had my base 2012 Ford Mustang V6 Mustang with automatic transmission for just over 6 months now.I bought it in December 2011. Winter driving conditionswere no problem with a sack of sand in the trunk ;)I love the acceleration, handling (and gas mileage).At 95 MPH, the Mustang is just percolating along and yawningly understressed."
"So far... I LOVE IT!!!  I've owned German and Japanese cars until last week.This is my first American car, and so far I LOVE IT.I LOVE the look of this car, as it looks like a throwback to the 60 - 70's designs, and doesn't resemble the Mustangs of the 80, 90's, or early 2000's at all.This is definately NOT the car I remember guys driving around in high school.The performance out of the 3.6L V6 is stronger than my Audi 2.7T A6, Acura RL, and BMW 328i.This car also handles tighter, and brakes harder than anything I've owned so far. "
"AWESOME TANG!  I grew up with what I thought was muscle cars from the 70s,80s and 90s but have never experienced a power house like this 2012 GT California special (automatic) which is loaded with comfort and the latest electronics,also has an awesome sound system.I have 2,200 miles on it and I'm getting 28.5 mpg on the highway with the cruise set at 69 mph,with a combined city/highway at 23 mpg.I have never been in a car that so many people (of ALL ages) have stared at while driving or just parked.The hardest thing to do in my life now is to turn off that 5.0 engine after I park my mustang GT in the garage for the night.FORD DID THEIR HOMEWORK ON THIS STANG!"
"Can't be Beat for the Price  Ordered 2012 Black Coupe V-6 with 6 speed manual and performance package. Out the door for a little over $23k, hell economy cars will run you more than that now. Car is awesome looking, very tight feel to it and it actually rides good considering the GT suspension and 19 inch wheels.And this thing gets up and goes and I have only taken it up to a little over 5000 rpm's ( redline is 7k). I cannot imagine what the V8 must be like but that would have cost $7,000 more and a lot more in insurance. Went from an 08 Tiburon and insurance actually went from over $500 every 6 months to about $310! Ordered in Aug just got it and now getting it ready to store...I hate winter!"
"2012 Mustang GT Premium  I bought my car over 2 months ago. I got the 2012 Premium GT with the Brembo brakes, Appearance package 5, 3.73 gears, comfort package and upgraded seats. Sticker was over $40,000 and got it for $35,800. I have had 6 Mustangs in my life (including a 1970 428 SCJ) but this is the best of them. Smooth ride for a Sports car and this car sticks to the road. I can't wait until the spring when I can get out and cruise with the local Mustang club."
"Can't Beat This Deal!!  Recently got a new 2012 V6 with the 6 speed automatic! Wow, this thing flies! We are quite impressed with the power! Fuel economy on the highway is great for such a fun car to drive, but city shows the ""sports car""! This Stang turns on a dime and handles extremely well! LOVE the automatic up/down driver AND passenger windows! Anyone that calls this V6 a ""mustake"" can eat it! Any V6 Mustang that can do 0-60 in 5.5 seconds is a sports car, and definitely a MUSTANG! Especially when achieving 31 mpg on the highway. Ford did a great job with this Mustang! Have had and still have many in the family and this is by far the best! Only complaint for us is OUR FAULT! We got a black one, ALWAYS DIRTY! "
SO FAR SO GOOD !!! BUY ONE IF YOU DARE !!!  Bought a v6 305 hp 2012 6 speed manual trans 3.31 axle with performance package ...Empty nester mid fiftys ex 60 s 70s muscle car owner.. I am tickled to death so far..A lot of minor conplaints by others mostly about chinese made getrag trans BUT knock on wood.. I did not buy this to hammer the crap out of it or modify it heavily..COMING from the old days I cant believe the value..Like going back and getting a new small block chevy corvette fastback..GET the performance package..worth EVERY dime..This car is fast/nimble/taunt/economical/good looking/and comfortable for two..recent windows down 30 mpg roadtrip in mountains doing 65-82 mph..OLD muscle car would get 15 if your lucky.. FUN CAR!!
"Total Disapointment!!  I cannot recommend this vehicle....at 5900 miles and less than two months old, the automatic transmission failed. During a tire rotation, technician discovered ATF leaking from the tranny. Ford Dealer removed the transmission, replaced forward seals, and a ""gear pump"". I can't be more specific because Ford worked to a Technical Service Bulletin, but refuses to let me see it or copy it. Car in the shop for 12 days...not what I imagined when I bought it!"
"My Toy  I have had many muscle car convertibles in the past and didn't realize how much I missed them until I took the Mustang for a test drive. The old cars, especially with the prices they are currently demanding, don't have anything on this car. The ride, handling and performance are awesome and I wouldn't even think twice before making a cross country trip with this car. Unfortunately I live in the great white north so my baby is put away for the winter. But since I put it away I have been busy installing the Ford Racing power pack, can't wait to drive it with the 325hp I will have in Spring!"
"Mostly great, with a few small gripes.  Picked up my Kona Blue '12 Mustang a month ago. My car is a base unit with the only options being the sport appearance package and the backup sensor/security package, both of which I highly recommend getting.The V6 is smooth and has good power, although low end torque is nonexistent. The manual trans is mediocre. Clutching is effortless and easy to modulate, but 1-2 shifts can be tricky and I've missed a couple during aggressive acceleration. My car grinds and clunks sometimes during even lazy 1-2 shifts. dealer says it's normal, along with a bunch of other clunks and whines this trans makes. I hope it holds together for a long time, as this is my 10th and definitely best Mustang for sure!"
"Ford recaptures a classic  I purchased this car in early June as primarily a commuter car that could double as a fun car for the weekends. I haven't been disappointed. The V6 Mustang Premium automatic is a very comfortable car. You can drive it for performance or economy. In my commute I usually get 28-31 MPG. If I turn on the AC or hit the gas hard, mileage will drop to the mid 20s. Ergonomics are good. I have no issues reaching any controls from the drivers seat. The car has some nice touches, too, like rear seat headrests that fold down to improve visibility. For the wrench turners, you can get to all parts of the engine without busting a knuckle. It makes up for the missing spare tire and slow downshifts."
"The Real Deal!  Heres a Real review. I use to be a big fan of foreign cars until the 2012 Mustang effect happened. Im a 32 year old, trendy, female who not only wants style and class but speed and stability. The mustang just feels and looks great!! Heads will turn with this car and cops will be waiting at night to see if your going to push on the gas. I will admit that sometimes I get frustrated bc I really want to open this baby upeverytime I pump on the gas, theres an undercover cop on the highway or traffic. Yuk! If you live in the city, forget it! Go on the open road!The only complaint is that my car is black, therefore I find myself washing it a lot! But thats the price you'll pay!"
Excellent Car Make Sure You Understand Options  1-Just purchased so can't address reliability yet2-Lots of controlled power3-I perceived too much hesitation before power kicked in with the automatic highly recommend manual tranny4-Please thoroughly research Brembo Brakes when deciding on options - not a great option for average folk in my opinion w/high maintenance cost and no spare tire
"Smiles on your face!  2012 GT Coupe . . . perfect blend for an easy daily driver plus everything you'd want to put a smile on your face.First, the smile factors . . . satisfying growl, neck-snapping torque, smooth clutch and tight 6 speed, balanced handling (you'll look for curvy two-lane roads) and appreciative looks.And, this comes in an easy-to-drive commuter.The engine is powerful enough so that you don't have to ""row"" yourself down the street.Gas mileage is 16/26 . . . you can get over 20 combined, but you'll want to put your foot into when you get a chance.Did I mention the growl?LOTS of bells and whistles with SYNC, bluetooth and the optional NAV system (recommended if you like music)."
2012 boss 302  great car
"Coming from a 3.7-V6, what a difference.  I owned a 2013 Premium V-6 for just over 2 years and always felt behind the more powerful 5.0, so I tried to modify my v6 to make up for the lower power. 5,000 dollars later I was happy with the performance, but all the bolt on ruined dependability. So i stumbled across a used 2012 performance white Boss 302, with only 6K miles. It was way more than I wanted to spend (36,000 Out-the-door). But I ended up getting over book value for my car and the Boss for under blue book value. I have owned the Boss for a little over a month and have put around 750 miles on it. It's my first 6 speed, and the Boss was a great car to learn on. I haven't pushed the cars performance yet, so I'm getting 22.8 MPG average being relatively fuel minded (75% backroads 25% City), also I only run 93 octane. Being 19 years old, I'm not too concerned with features or comfort. But if you're looking for luxury and comfort, you better pass this car up. It lives up to it's track car name with stiff, but manageable ride quality. I have the restrictor plates on the side pipes removed, which makes a lot more noise and causes a slight drone. I think It's awesome though, now I won't need a aftermarket exhaust. There's a lack of entertainment/features but I think it gives what you need, and nothing more. How I define it when talking to other people about my car, is that they took all the money in interior add-on's, and put all the money into the engine and drive-train. With the longetivity of the coyote 5.0, but with forged internals and improved cooling (The Boss 302 engine is called RoadRunner Instead of coyote, since the only thing in common is the block) I think this car will last hundreds of thousands miles with proper maintenance, all while providing awesome performance, sound, looks, and adequate features. Just be prepared for more expensive oil changes, tires, and a more expensive gas bill for most people. And lets not forget insurance cost if your under 25 like myself, $1500/6 months for me. Over-all I am very happy with the 302, it is the ideal budget performance car that is easily a daily driver. Will definitely be keeping this car for a lifetime. It's like being a part of a unique club to drive 1 out of 8289 made between 2012 and 2013, compared to the 7 some-odd million mustangs ever made."
"Boss 302  Having owned many muscle cars over the years I did a great deal of research before deciding on the Boss.It is definitely the best bang for the buck.You can tool around in the car and it is docile as a lamb but if you want performance it isthere in an instant.Achieving 20 mpg in town and 25 on the road in normal driving.Spirited driving results in 16 mpg overall.The handling is superb and the engine power isas expected.This is not for the faint of heart, the ride is somewhat choppy and stiff, there is a lot of road noise at highway speeds and it is easy to spin the tires in the first 3 gears but if you are a muscle car lover this is all just part of the fun."
"1st Boss Review!!  Just got a performance white Boss, used with 4k miles and no trac key or Recaro seat option. really wanted those options but I refused to pay the stupid 10k markup that the dealers currently insist on. Now on to the car. In a word WOW! the handling and power of this Stang is remarkable! I can't wipe the grin off my face every time I hit an on ramp or a corner that I can accelerate through. I am driving the car daily and it is quitecivilized below 4500 rpm then all bets are off! I have been amazed as to how mant people have come to talk to me about the car or give a big thumbs up!"
Like a hot girlfriend!  It has the looks and is fun on short drives but don't count on it for much more than that. Not comfortable on a long trip and not especially reliable. I've replaced the water pump twice in two years. There's an occasional knock in the steering or suspension linkage no one has been able to pinpoint. The stretch belt design for the a/c compressor is the stupidest design in history. Even experienced shop mechanics have a rough time putting one on.
