"Yummilicious And... yes, the scent is the best. if you like lemon frosting you won't be able to get enough of this lotion. but also, it's almost 100 natural, none of the yucky ingredients like in major brands of lotion. no mineral oil, no petroleum, etc. but also, it completely works. you know how sometimes you opt for organic choices and it's good, but not as good as popular but nastier brands jr watkins delivers. this lotion softens your hands and body, leaves you ungreasy and smells perfect. even my fiance likes it and uses it and he's pretty much anti-lotion in all regards. the price is absolutely right, too--get it!"
"One of my favorites The Hand-Cream-Lemon-Cream has such a refreshing fragrance. I wish it would last all day. It is soothing to the hands and I get compliments when I use it especially from my daughters and granddaughters, they want me to get some for them It is one of my favorite hand creams. I wish Watkins still had the vanilla body cream that too was a favorite."
"Gave it a Try This cream did not do much for my face or throat area. I have gone back to my generic brand, it works better and is not as expensive. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This product makes me feel young and fresh This product makes me feel young and fresh because it opens up my pores and it allows me to breathe with some sort of comfort.
bring back Coca I am in agreement with alot of your customers about the color Cocoa. OMG it was the absolute best and bought as many as i could find before it was gone....the best color and PLEASE bring it back or least tell us your not going to so we can find something else. I did find a Pink color (which is similar to Cocoa) in Organic Hemp and is my new replacement until you bring back Cocoa.
"cocoa I recently have been to several stores looking for Bees cocoa. i rarely wear lip stick or anything on my lips. a couple yrs ago my sister got this for me and told me to try it, i was hooked, loved it. now i cant find it know where. then got on the computer, and found out its no longer available. omg please bring this back, its the only one i'll wear. thank you so much."
"Beautiful!! I absolutely love this product! It had the consistency and the benefit of a lip balm, but the color of a lipstick. The frosty colors are beautiful. The slimness of the packaging is easy to carry and I love the peppermint scent. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because I have a problem with getting the shimmer to crank back down into the tube. So I only twist out a very little at a time. I love the color Caramel."
Lip Shimmer I simply need to add my request to the others. PLEASE BRING BACK THE COLOR COCOA!!!!!!!! There will be a 5 rating if the color Cocoa - Lip Shimmer is brought back. I have looked and looked for something I like better but to no avail. I can't use the colors you currently have. They are to pale or to orange or to pink. I have been using lip shimmer for many years and had to stop because of the discontinued cocoa color.
"Bring Back the Color Toffee I have been searching everywhere to find the Toffee color Lip Shimmer and couldn't find it so finally went to the website. Everyone I know is using it. I gave them out for Christmas presents a year ago and everyone loved the color as well and asking me where to get it. You would have quite a few orders for Toffee Lip Shimmer if you still had it in stock. Please, Please bring it back...Will you ever bring it back"
Please bring Cocoa back! The only color I've worn for years is Cocoa--I didn't realize you discontinued it or I would have stock-piled it a long time ago! Now I'm down to a tiny bit left. I went on line today to order some since I haven't seen it in the stores--only to find out it doesn't exist anymore. I'm so sad. The other colors are too pink or too orange for me. Please consider bringing it back--I for sure will buy some!!
"Kiss Me!!!! I like this lip shimmer. It does have color, so don't be fooled. Pick something that goes with your skin tone. I, as being part of the chocolate skinned community :D, bought Raisin. It is a wonderful color. It's a deep red, and it goes with my complexion very well. It has a nice mint 'zing' to it when you first out it on. I only wish that this would last longer that's why I gave it 4 stars."
"Lip Shimmer in Assorted Colors - I own a few shades of the Lip Shimmer: Fig, Rhubarb, Apricot, and Peony. The formula is somewhere between a lip balm and a lipstick, and has a fairly strong bite of peppermint. The shimmer adds dimension and, in my opinion, is generally subtle enough for any age group to wear. Fig is a warm red-brown with hints of coral. I wouldn't say it looks awesome with my skin (fair with slight yellow undertones), so I apply lightly and don't try to build this one. Rhubarb is a bright, cool pinky-red. I do like how this shade looks with my skin however, it's rather bold so I wouldn't use this as an everyday shade. Apricot is a neutral peachy-coral ... like a nude, but with more kick. The color reminds me of the tinted lip balm in Hibiscus. It's a lovely shade when I want more oomph without looking too done-up. (Added note: Out of the four lip shimmers I've tried, this one was the least shimmery.) So far, this is my favorite of the bunch. Peony is a pale beige-mauve that leans a tad towards red with a near-frost finish and flecks of gold (if that all makes any sense - lol). It doesn't seem as pigmented as the other three. I find it similar to my natural lip color, just with a shimmery/frosty shine. The jury's still out on this one! Further experimentation is warranted. Staying power is about 2-3 hours max, which I feel is realistic considering it's a natural product. Even after the color wears off my lips still feel nice and moisturized. The small size of the tube is very convenient and doesn't take up much room in the purse. Conclusion: These lip shimmers are a nice step up from tinted lip balms without going right to lipstick. I look forward to trying more shades in the future!"
"sparkly! I am a long time user of Burt's Bees regular chapstick but I like a little color now and then. This is nice lip gloss as far as texture and scent. It could be a little more long lasting but I guess that would make it thicker, which I despise. I should try some of these newer colors, I like a very neutral color that accents my lip color not one that is vastly different from my own color."
Please bring cocoa back!!! I have been searching everywhere for my favorite lip shimmer and finally typed it into a google search to find out that it has been discontinued. I see that there are many other disappointed customers out there as well. I love that shade and I think it is safe to say that there are a great deal of others who feel the same way since we have all taken time to write these reviews. Please bring it back and make all of your customers happy!!! Thank you
"Great product Very smooth - goes on easily, immediately absorbs into skin and never feels greasy. Keeps skin looking fresh and natural. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Please bring back cocoa! I adore your lip shimmers. I have been using them as my lipstick for years now, and my signature shade is cocoa. I get asked frequently what lipstick I use, and I get so many compliments on it. It is a beautiful color and it makes my lips feel great even in cold, winter weather. I am very disappointed to learn that you are discontinuing the shade cocoa. Please bring it back! I would give this product 5 stars if cocoa was still one of my choices."
"It's a good lipbalm The color is awesome and the feeling in your lips is very good and it works as a moisturizing. It's really small, like half a pencil. I though for the picture that it was like a normal lipstick, that was kind of disappointing. It must be used like a chap stick not like a lipstick because it's almost impossible to put it back into the tube once you finish the application, that's really annoying when you first try it."
"BRING BACK TOFFEE!!! Last time I could not find Toffee color in the stores, so I ordered 6 of them online, and now I am out again, but discovered I cannot order Toffee anymore. My girlfriend and I have always kept each other in the loop as to where we could get Toffee because she also loves it. I don't buy any other lip color except for Burt's. I also use Champagne, but Toffee is my favorite, as is many other people. Please consider bringing back this color!"
Love Cocoa and Toffee! I agree with the other reviewers! I'm so sorry you've discontinued Cocoa and Toffee! I miss the gentle mint tingle on my lips but there are no other colors that compare. I bought out a Cocoa supply at a kiosk this summer and I used them all up. Cocoa is a great shade that looks great on any complexion. The lip shimmer would get 5 stars from me if I could use the new colors. I will be happy to order in bulk if Cocoa can be manufactured again!
"Discontinued shade of lip shimmer Im sooooooo upset that the Cocoa color has been discontinued!!! It has been my favorite for years as well as several of my friends. I have tried the other colors and am not satisfied with the shades. Nothing even comes close. I love the shimmer, but now have to buy another competitors product to even come close. WHY WAS IT DISCONTINUED! I would have bought the entire remaining stock. Very upset about it. A girl and her lip color is a very important thing."
shiny shimmer ...:) i gotta the guava shimmer 4 days ago and applied it to my lips as soon as i bought it...it has a tingle effect on ur lips...oly con is it is not enogh hydrating!!..so i applied pomogranate lip balm over it....it was shimmery.... also i found another use for this shimmer is to use as a blush shimmer and a light stroke below the brows gives u a good natural eye highlighter!!! i love to use it as a blush...as it get absorbs better jus by my two fingers two times...VIOLA im done...SO 3 PURPOSES for this great shimmer!!!!!
da best I love that it has that tingly feeling of the beeswax lip balm and the moisture still. The colors are great but the color never matches the cap...... thats the only thing i personally don't like at all. But other than that i love burt's bees lip shimmer!!!! There is a color there for everyone. I found one for my mom and she is super tuff on lipsticks. I was misleaded on the website. I thought the lip shimmers were wayyyyy bigger than they really were..... but it works so well that i think it's worth it. And come on it natural and not tested on animals.
"What happened to Raisin I know people who've been wearing it for years and now it's so hard to find. I have checked all major retailers, drugstores, etc. and even online. It must be discontinued because I've seen some high prices for it online. When I asked about it someone in the company claimed it hasn't been, but that does not seem to be true. I stopped using these and recently came back because it's a nice balm with good color payoff. Please bring back Raisin!"
"Pair with BB lip balm It feels great! I've been using BB lip shimmer since the first week it showed up on store shelves! If applied alone, the shimmer is gritty and leaves my lips feeling dry. That said, *the trick* is to use BB lip balm underneath the lip shimmer. I tried this and VOILA! the lip shimmer looks/feels fantastic. The color is noticeable without being overpowering in the least. While I wish I could just throw on the lip shimmer and go (I'm super low maintainance when it comes to cosmetics), I feel the extra step is worth it for the difference it makes in how my lips look/feel. This lip shimmer lasts well. On days when I care enough to seriously readjust my appearance during the workday, I'd say reapplying once in a 9a-5p workday (for a total of two applications) should be sufficient... if you're going out in the evening, maybe a third time. As an added bonus, Mr. TiaB loves the peppermint taste, given that many lip shimmer can taste like junk. Yum-- Kisses! -*) I was conflicted in rating this product, since it works so badly by itself but SO WELL when paired with the lip balm. (I decided to rate the shimmer on its own.)"
"Please don't discontinue darker colors I suffer from vitiligo, a condition where the skin becomes depigmented. It especially attacks areas of high pigment like the lips. A few years ago, my lips went white. I was using a commercial lipstick, but was not happy with how it dried my lips, when a friend recommended Burt's Bees with Color. I found my exact shade in Papaya and was ecstatic. Unfortunately, when I went to buy a new one, all the stores had were light colored shimmers. The darkest I could find was Peony, which barely tints my lips, which any lip balm can do. Fortunately for me, you still have Papaya on this site as a clearance item and I am buying several tubes, but I can't be the only one using your product not purely for cosmetic reasons. The light-colored frosts are not something I've ever liked, and from the other reviews I've seen, I'm not alone in wanting the darker colors back. I'm very happy with your product for how it treats my lips. Discontinuing colors is unfortunate. Is it so hard to keep a large stock of colors available Word is getting out about how good these are compared to lipstick. I know I've been spreading the word."
Regenerist Hydration Regenerist provides a deep hydration of the skin. I find my skin is smoother after use. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Overall Review I tried Rhubard Toffee since it was in the grab bag that I recieved from a friend. The Toffee is a little bit too brown for my lips but the Rhubard is nice and red. When I put on the Rhubard, it was brighter than than shown. As for the toffee it was more of a brown colored shade. You only need a little to make your lips red, so the stick will last a long time if used. It was also long lasting. The shimmer is more like a lipstick than a lip balm shimmer product. It is better than lipstick since it isn't heavy doesn't cake on and flake on later. It lasts pretty long, even when you wipe it off, my lips were still a bit tinted red from the Rhubarb color. Overall it's a great replacement for lipstick has a great range of colors. If you don't like a lipstick tint of color the radiance lip shimmer would be a better choice."
"It's great I was afraid to try this because I thought something named shimmer would be too shimmery. It's not. This is a great lipstick alternative. For me, it's the right amount of color and gloss. The size also makes it very portable. I have three of these and I haven't had any issues with the way they've packaged. They do all smell like peppermint."
"WHERE IS COCOA You have no idea how much money I have spent over MANY years on lipsicks that weren't right!! They look one color and when applied, a completely different color. Once I discovered Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer in COCOA, my life changed for the better, and my pocketbook was thicker!!! PLEASE BRING BACK COCOA!!!! Have a classic line as other cosmetics do when a product was eliminated and then brought back due to customer demand. I'm so happy to see so many others who share my opinion. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain...life-long, satisfied customers!!!! Please, please, please...bring back COCOA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Love it, but needs better descriptions I think I initially reviewed this product about a year ago. I was unhappy with the product because I was looking for a hint of color and shimmer, and got something more like a lipstick. After complaining to a friend about my disappointment, she let me try on her color. I have found that rhubarb goes on more like lipstick and it's color is quite strong. Peony, Nutmeg, and Caramel just add a hint of color. So, I guess you need to be careful which color you buy because some are more like lipstick. I absolutely LOVE the peony, nutmeg, and caramel. They add the perfect amount of color for my taste."
"Love this, but please bring back Raisin I buy Lip Shimmer in bulk and always have some in my pants pocket. Since I do not carry a purse, it's petite form is perfect for me. It's a spot of color but moisturizing and so I use it mountain biking, skiing, etc. Although not rated for SPF, I have not gotten sunburned even in the Utah desert while wearing this product. I love this in Raisin, Fig, and Caramel. While I will settle for Fig, I am with those who would love to see you bring Raisin back. When I found out Raisin was being eliminated a couple years ago, I bought 20 or 30 tubes. Please bring Raisin back before I completely run out! Thank you."
"Cocoa Lip Shimmer I love this color ordered 4 tubes last time. However, 2 of the tubes must have been turned up when filled because there was only a tiny amount in the tube."
"My alternative to lipstick! I have always hated wearing lipstick because I felt like it made my lips dry out faster. With prom coming up last year I decided to try this out as I've absolutely loved their chapsticks. I really loved the caramel color, which looks nice and coppery. Felt good just like wearing their regular chapstick. I did come off kinda easy when I kissed my boyfriend (though if you wait a few minutes it doesn't come off as easily) and it won't last well through eating and drinking. But I'm fine with having to reapply it when it feels so much better than lipstick (looks prettier than many with that shimmery stuff). I do think there needs to be some more colors and shades, not everyone is a fan of the pinks and reds (my preference has always been the more orangey and coppery shades)."
"So sad! BRING BACK COCOA FIG! I have used Burts Lip Shimmer for YEARS and am so upset when I found out that Toffee wasn't to be found in any store I was devistated. I have been looking for Cocoa as well and low and behold decided to try the site only to find they are both discontinued!! How could this be Its an Outrage! I have received so many compliments on my lip color and don't use anything other than these two shades *sometimes champagne. Try others---WELL---I have tried Carmel, Peony, Ruhbarb, Fig, Rasin all of which don't look right on me! BRING THEM BACK PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I have to go shopping for something else to wear. Sadly you lost my business. Hopefully you will bring them back someday!"

nice I really like the fact that it just gives your lips a little sparkle with not much color. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"New formula is terrible I used (and loved) this product for several years until they changed it. It used to moisturize my skin and left it feeling soft. Now, it sits on top of my skin and is never absorbed. It just leaves a slimy film on my skin. I will no longer purchase this product."
I liked it I really did like this. It took a little longer for the results I had hoped for but I realize if you keep a good regiment it will work really well. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Want MERLOT back! I love this product, but the very best color for me is MERLOT and it isn't available anymore. PLEASE BRING BACK MERLOT!"
refreshing This product is great for someone who wants more color than with the gloss. It has a refreshing peppermint smell and flavor.
Hydrating and pleasant fragrance This product has recently changed its formula. I have been using the old formula for years and probably prefer that formula over the new one but it is still too early to judge for certain. I definitely prefer the white dispenser top over the new black one since the residue looks very unappealing on a black surface. Does not look clean which is what you would want your facial products to represent. Overall I still like this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Coffee Please bring back coffee color. Love your product, but will not buy any more until coffee comes back. The best color ever!!!"

Nice I like this product. I think the different colors are really nice and it really keeps my lips moisturized and soft.
A great product This is a great everyday lip color. More color than a gloss but nice and shiny. Great with the peppermint cooling flavor.
"Great sheer Love that the color is there, but not too thick. Nice and sheer. And moisturizing! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Bring Back Cocoa! I've been desperately looking for cocoa at every retailer for months! So sad to come here find it's been discontinued!
Great for pairing These lip shimmers work well alone and even better when paired with a lip tint balm. Glides on smooth and no tackiness!
SenseAtional This product is very good and smells sensational. I recommend for all who have ashy skin! I'm VSOP by nature . Very smooth On point skinn

Shimmers Love the lip shimmers! I have given them as gifts. Have one in every coat pocket and purse. (Don't keep them in your pants pockets though...they get mushy.)
PERFECT! I love this product. It is so hard to find colors that work with my skin tone. The color is noticeable without being overpowering. Highly recommended!

"PLEASE BRING BACK OLD FORMULA!!! I have been using Oil of Olay for over 20 years. This product worked so well for me, but the new formula is HORRIBLE! I cannot find anything to work for my skin like it did! The smell is flowery and it is too thick. The old formula was so light"
This product feels good on your skin It's not greases and feels good on your skin. It also gives you a beautiful glow. I used it for about two weeks and saw a difference in in my complexion. I would recommend this product to everyone. I brought some for my sister she also loved it. Then she told her friend and now we all are using it and skin looks moor firm then ever

lip shimmer I loved the cocoa lip shimmer. Please bring back that color. I had so many people ask me what I used on my lips I always brag about my Burts Bees lip shimmer.
Where is the Cocoa I love the color and the richness of the look. Why would you discontinue a color that is obviously so popular. Email me when you decide to put it back in the stores..

"Love it! I love this stuff! My favorite color is Fig, which is very flattering to my pale skin and reddish hair. Lip Shimmer is sheer and light, not greasy, and is suitable for all ages. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love, Love, Love It. I've only used it for one week, but I have been very impressed. Using the facial mask of my CPAP machine has caused the area around my nose, cheeks and eyes to become really dry, flaky, and raw looking. But after using the cream for one week, I noticed a drastic improvement to my skin. The areas that are irritated by my nose mask are no longer dry and flaky or red and raw. My skin look very fresh and moist. Other moisturizers that I tried made my face look greasy not at all the look I wanted. Thanks for making a product that does just what it is supposed to do. Love it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
BRING BACK COCOA!! You say you care about your customers well it seems to me your customers want cocoa! It is the best !! Nothing compares to it !! PLZ bring back the best bring back cocoa...
"BEST EVER I don't use lipstick alot because I don't like the dry cakey feel of it. This is light, the color selections are fantastic, and it has staying power. I also love the slight tingle!"
"Cocoa- where did you go Please bring back the Cocoa lip balm, I bought every tube I could find and am no longer able to find it anywhere.... Can I buy this color online Thank you and please hurry"
Love Cocoa I absolutely love the color and feel of the cocoa lip shimmer. It adds just the right amount of color while helping to heal lips. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"missing Nutmeg I love your lip shimmer line, but I am missing the color Nutmeg. Carmel is a close 2nd but not quite as dark as Nutmeg. Hope there is enough of a demand to bring the color back."
Bring Back I need to know when you will bring back Nutmeg Lip Shimmer. My face was burned in an accident and Nutmeg is the only color whose pigment combination does not make my lips crack.
a lil or a lot I love this shimmer because I can use it 4 work for a lil color or wear it out when I want BIG color but not Full On Lipstick. And every1 looks good in Red and this Merlot Rocks!
Lip Shimmers Love this product and have been using for MANY years!! What happened to the color NUTMEG That was my absolute favorite. Can't believe you have not brought that back yet!
Incredible product This is a wonderful product. I love Fig and Watermelon but would love to try them all. This product moisturizes my lips without that sticky feeling. And I love the light tingle!
"Happy Lips! This is the perfect solution for giving your lips a pretty tint without having to worry about moisture. Not only does it un-chap my lips, it adds just the right amount of color!"
It's a good product for soft skin This product is really helpful for dry rough skin and I use their product everyday
Love the feel! I love this product. It stays on longer than the lip balm. Maybe because I use a lip liner with it. Champagne is my favorite. I've used this for a long time and get compliments.
love the Toffee color I'm always searching for the Toffee lip shimmer but it's always sold out in the stores. I just started buying them online. The color is perfect and I love how soft my lips feel.
"Best Gloss out there This is easily my favorite gloss - great scent, great color and a lovely tingly minty feel. The colors are sufficiently bright, and I make sure to have this on me at all times!"
Cocoa is back! I have refused to accept that Cocoa is no more so periodically check available colors. Imagine my delight when I found it! Thank you so much for bringing my color back.
"Don't stop selling Fig lip shimmer This is the best of the best of all your lip products for me. Color, creaminess, shine it is my favorite lip product ever! Please don't ever stop making Fig lip shimmer!"
Just enough color I teach wind instruments in a middle school and have to take off and reapply lipstick several times a day. Lip Shimmers go on easily and are just the right amount of cover for the work day.
Happy Lips This is the best product I have found! My favorite color is Champagne. It is light on your lips. Also is nice knowing there is no harsh chemical in it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great lip product I love the lip shimmers because you not only get a great looking lip color but also the nourishing, moisturizing benefits as well. The peppermint gives me a fresh, alive feeling as well."
"It's the best Perfect for me - just enough color instead of too much like lipstick, smooth and weightless instead of sticky and gross like lipgloss. I like the dark shades like Merlot the best."
Bring Back Cocoa I have been using your products for several years and LOVE Cocoa Lip Shimmer. It's the only color that looks right on me. So I add my plea to all the others. PLEASE bring back cocoa!!!!
Products are great Great and amazing because it is more than useful like it is likely to change your life ego and appearance

"A product I can't live without This product does not only feels great, looks great it is also refreshing. I cannot live a day without this product. It is a lipstick minty lipgloss combined. Mmmm, sooo great!"
"What happened to papaya I found the best color for me, after trying three different ones, and now it's nowhere to be found. Don't tell me you stopped making that one. Please, please, bring back PAPAYA."

"Favorite Natural Makeup Product This is the first natural makeup product I used and love it. The color is great and it lasts a long time. Only problem is it tastes good, so you have to be careful not to lick it off!"
"OH, NO!! WHERE'S COCOA I can't believe cocoa shimmer has been discontinued. From the reviews here, I see I am not the only one. Please bring cocoa shimmer back or my love affair with Burt's Bees is over!!!"
Best Color Ever! I love my cocoa shimmer! The color is so beautiful! And I will always order it from your website! Thank you!
"Wonderful lip shimmer This lip shimmer smooths on so nicely and lasts. It also has a great peppermint taste. It is very easy to apply as well as, one does not need a lot to look great. My favorite is Fig."
"Soft skin I have been having problems with dry skin around my chin area. I typically have dry skin anyway and wanted to try this product after using numerous other products that do not seem to help. It took about a week before I started noticing any difference plus, taking extra care on how I cleansed my face. This product is wonderful. I am now hooked after no longer having that tight itching and dry feeling I had. I recommend this product to anyone who really needs something for dry skin. Thank you. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great! I love this lip shimmer and don't wear anything else on my lips. I love the wide variety of colors, from subtle to true color. Don't ever stop making these products! PLEASE! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
watermelon is nice i like watermelon the best. it is the perfect color for any occasion.it is nice to keep one in your bag for a quick touch of color. it also puts a spring in your step!!

"Where are my colors!!!! This is the best lip product I have ever used, but what happened to my nutmeg and my papaya shades!! NONE of the current shades look good with my skin tone -- NONE!"
Love this stuff I love the Burts Bees lip Shimmer. They have so many colors to choose from but the Raisin is my favorite color. It keeps your lips smooth and adds color. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Best Balm Ever! I finally found a lip product with everything I've ever wanted! Color, moisture, natural ingredients, and long lasting. I doubt I will ever buy any lipstick or gloss or any other balm ever again."
Cocoa is the best Please bring Cocoa back. Why was it discontinued It is the only color I have used for years and nothing comes close to that shade. Would you consider bringing it back if enough people requested it :)
"Lip Shimmer Cocoa THANK YOU for bringing back Lip Shimmer Cocoa. I am Asian and have a tan all year long. This is the best color for my skin, it is inexpensive and I love how I can use this product day and night."

Where is the Cocoa and Toffee I have searched high and low and cannot find my favorite colors anymore!!! Love the Cocoa - best color and lip shimmer ever. Please bring it back and then let us know when it will be available !!! :)
cocoa!!!! Please bring back the cocoa lip shimmer!!!! I have been looking every where for it. The iterated Colorado I have tried just aren't the same!!! I'm glad to see other posts about the discontinued cocoa.
"So Nice This is a great way to add color to your lips and still moisturize. It doesn't leave you lips dried out like some lipsticks. The color doesn't last as long as some, but still worth it. It feels great!"
The only thing I don't like is smell I love how it feels and how it works but hate the smell. Every other aspect is perfect!
"Bring back Cocoa Please bring back the cocoa! It was by far my favorite color and I kept multiple tube in purses, jackets etc. I started replacing all my other lip stuff with this and can't find it anywhere, anymore."
"Love These! I am so excited to finally get my cocoa lip shimmer! I have been searching for months, only able to find displays that had been picked bare. I wish that more retail stores would begin to carry these!"
LOVE COCOA!!! Thank you so much for bringing back my favorite lip shimmer in Cocoa!!!! I've been using this for years and always get compliments when I wear it. It truly is the perfect color for many skin types!!

"Please bring back the old formula I am so disappointed! I have used this product for years because of it's soft smell and great results. The new formula feels greasy, smells awful and I don't feel like my skin looks as toned and wrinkle free anymore. This was a five star product for so many years...why change it Please bring back the old formula."
This product is so smooth I love the way this product makes my skin feel it doesn't make it feel greasy or oily goes on smooth
Greatest feel and color I only use this product for my lips and have for several years. The smell is so fresh and nice and I never want to use anything with chemicals on my lips or any other part of my body. So thankful for Burts Bees.
SoSoSo Sad to see you have no Cocoa! I use a half a dozen to a dozen burts bees products but I use 2 products every day and you have discontinued both of them! Please bring back Cocoa! It is the only color I wear and I get so many compliments on it!
"Cocoa Lip Shimmer Please bring Cocoa back!!! I am African American and have tried every color... It is my favorite and highly compliments my brown complexion... Now, I can't find it anywhere! Please, Please, Please Bring It BACK!"
Nice color I thought I would give this try since I always have chapped lips and wearing lipstick makes it even worse. This stuff is great at keeping my lips soft and the colors are very nice. This was defiantly a good buy.
Great Product I absolutely love this product! It is the only Lip product that I use. The colors are subtle just as I like and the peppermint leaves a nice fresh tingle upon application. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love Lip Shimmer Have been using Burt's Bees products for years and love the products! However, you discontinued 2 of my favorite shades: Papaya and Coffee. I'm currently using Caramel and hoping you will not discontinue this color"
Toffee Is there anywhere to still get the toffee shade I loved wearing it over a variety of lip stick colors. It help mute those that were too bright and give shimmer to all the rest. Please bring back this color!!!
Papaya and Nutmeg great colors - discontinued - please bring these colors back!! Isn't it about Customer Satisfaction I was a satisfied customer - I love the product - hate when I love a product and then it is discontinued!!!!
Please bring Nutmeg back I love this product. It goes on smooth and lasts and the peppermint tingle is great--esp in the winter. But PLEASE bring NUTMEG back. That is the perfect color. Just a little color for a natural look. Please!

"Simply the best This is ALL I seem to wear anymore. I love the Shimmer sticks!! The minty cool feeling is just that...cooling on my lips. They don't feel waxy either. The sheer colors just give my lips a very nice tint, too!"

"Great color and shine! I use the Rhubarb Lip Shimmer, and am very happy with both color and the bit of shine it contains. Plus, it has great lip feel, and is not drying, as so many other brands of lipstick do. Terrific product!"
BRING BACK TOFFEE I'm so sad that this color has been discontinued. When I found out it was going to be I bought about 10 I've gone through them all now and I'm finding it difficult to find a replacement. Pls Pls bring it back.!!

"Just enough shimmer, great product! I'm in my 40's and I really like this product (even my mom does too). That says a lot! Love all the colors I've tried and they are not too shimmery. I enjoy the light mint flavor, it makes my mouth feel fresh."
"Great Stuff I love this lip shimmer. I wear it as my lipstick, everyday. It is moisturizing with the perfect amount of color. It goes on so perfectly, that I can put it on with no problem, when I have no mirror around!!!!"
"BRING BACK COCOA! I have used the color Cocoa for years. It is the ONLY lip color I wear. Please, please, please bring it back. I bought the Plum, it's not the same. I am SO sad! Listen to your fans. Bring back the cocoa!"
Great Product! This is by far by favorite sparkly chap stick! It leaves your lips so moisturized but with a tint of shimmery color. Perfect for school or just around the house! I got the colors champagne and radiance.
A must have in my purse I absolutely love this product. I must have it with me always. The Champagne is my FAVORITE and is a great little pick me up for some color. I love the slight tingle of the product and the way it moisturizes.
"Tinted colors Loved this product, but Please bring back cocoa toffee!!!! How many ppl have to write ask about this!!!! Make it happen before the holidays boost your sales. Without it you lose another loyal customer!"
brought back from retirement OMG I was so thrilled when I found they are making lip shimmers in cocoa again..it is the only shade that looks great on everyone..I have been checking for years and couldn't believe my luck..... THANK YOU!
"Cocoa Please, please, please bring back Cocoa!!!! The other colors either have too much orange or red in them. I prefer the natural tone of Cocoa! And, from the looks of the reviews, so do a bunch of other women."
Lip Shimmer is the best!!! Love me some Cocoa Lip Shimmer!!! I've been using it for over 10 yrs. I'm able to condition and color my lips with one quick swipe of lip shimmer . I don't go anywhere without my Cocoa Lip Shimmer!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Perfect! I love these Lip Shimmers, not only are they a great lip balm but give just the right hint of color to your lips. The small, slim size of the package is easy to slip into your pocket or the smallest purse."
Awesome product I love my lip shimmer! It smells nice. It wears well. And it keeps my lips soft. Bonus is that I can wear it no matter where I am going if I want a little something more then standard clear lip balm.
The best! I bought this in raisin a while back and it was a bit too dark for me. I received watermelon as a gift and it looked very nice. Tried on fig and loved that color too! I look forward to trying more colors!
BRING BACK TOFFEE PLEASE BRING TOFFEE BACK. I absolutely LOVE the product ... especially that color - I could wear it alone or blend it with one of lighter shade Lipsticks. I have fair skin and it worked great for me
"Love the Lip Shimmers I have used this products for years, and is good in Summer as well as Winter. They make your lips soft and the colors are beautiful for warm or cool colors in your wardrobe. I rate this product a A+++! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Ah-Mazing! ohmugud! this stuff is ba-rilliant! i first heard about it in the ah-mazing book Alphas by Lisi Harrison. and i fell in love with it! i'm never goin back to Lip Smackers or Blistex again!!!!!!!!!!!
"Cocoa!!!! Why did you get rid of Cocoa and now I can't find taupe, so I had to buy 25 here! It seems everyone wants it according to reviews, so please bring it back! The other colors don't suit me....too orangey."
"Wish merlot color were avail. In stores! I have worn these lip shimmers for a long time, love them. Just wish my fav color, merlot, were avail in stores. It used to be, but now I can only order it online. Please bring merlot back to the stores!"
"burts bee's champagne lip shimmer It's amazing... my favorite lip product ever! I luv the champagne, radiance and guava shades the best... and I love the minty taste and no need for lip stick or gloss... and I am a make up fanatic:)"
Love this product!!!! I am allergic to all lipsticks and so greatful I found Burt's Bees lip shimmers. It keeps your lips moist and there is a great selection of colors. I have been using this product for at least 8 years. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Soft skin guaranteed!! I love this lotion because I enjoy rubbing my wife's feet with it.
"Really good I have the apricot, and it's really beautiful with my caramel hair and green eyes. It's smooth like chapstick, isn't filled with glitter, and I just love it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"one of my favorite lipsticks I have about 5 of these in different colors stashed in every purse, pocket and drawer. I love them! They give me a smidge of color and look completely natural, yet make me feel gussied up! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love this! This is one of my favorites! It doesn't bleed and the particular red shade of the cherry is perfect. Not to bold, or tint of pink etc. It nourishes my lips non-stop! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love the color! fresh and clean feeling I was looking for a daily lip balm that would add color and help my chapped lips. And this was the answer. My lips look great and feel great. Since using this product my lips are now softer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Merlot color is Wonderful The merlot lip shimmer is wonderful!!!!! Very hard to locate in stores. Please supply this color to more stores. The others are too shimmery and light for my taste, but the merlot is perfect!"
"Awesome! My sister bought me a Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer, and I LOVE IT! I wear it all the time, and while you have to put it on more than once a day, it's worth it for the lovely look I get on my lips."
Love the tingle I tried this shimmer after trying the lip gloss and like it a little better than the gloss. It stays on longer and has a nice tingly feeling. Keeps lips moist without applying over and over.
just enough tint I usually have problems with lipstick. It always dries my lips out or makes me break out in a cold sore. Lip Shimmers are perfect. They give me just enough tint and are very moisturizing.
Papaya Please bring this shade back...it was my all-time favorite and the others do not even come close! Please...or let me know if you have some in the warehouse and I will buy it. Thanks...a fan
"Wonderful everyday product Normally I don't like wearing colored gloss or lipstick, because it doesn't taste nice and it feels bad... But, Lip Shimmers are perfect because they taste and smell great, and have just enough color to brighten your face up. :)"
So soft! I LOVE the way my skin is left feeling after I use this product!
Great Stuff I love this stuff. It makes your lips tingle and the color is just perfect and there are so many to choose from. I don't really like lipstick but this is nice since it has some color but doesn't feel heavy or sticky in any way.
"kiss me lips This has the exact amount of color I want. I've never liked lipstick because it was too much, but I like a touch of color in my lips. This is the perfect balance. AND it's a rockin' lip balm too. Very soothing and moisturizing."
"Super Product I have given up using other lipsticks after discovering Burts Bees Lip Shimmer. I like the fact that the don't contain any nasty ingredients, the many colors to pick from are great and they last long, even during eating."
"The only gloss I put on my lips I have been addicted to Burts Bees lip shimmer for several years now and it is the only gloss I put on my lips. Specifically Papaya color, my favorite. As a red head and animal activists, Burts Bees fits me like a glove!"
"BRING BACK COCOA Love the lip stick, my favorite color is gone. Please Bring Back Cocoa, that is the only color I loved. I have tried several other colors and types but that is the only one that I loved and got sooo many compliments on."
Love this Lip Shimmer! My lips dry very easily and I have searched far wide for a lip color that doesn't dry me out. I finally found it with this lip shimmer. I love the color and it keeps my lips moist. It's the only lip color I will wear!
THE BEST!!!! I have loved my regular Burts Bees lip balm forever and once I discovered the shimmers I was hooked! I love the light pink and it's a double bonus...nice color with the soothing feel of my burts bees balm! THE BEST!!!!!
Good Moisturizing and Sheer Color I can usually wear very little on my lips that does not cause them to dry out and start peeling. This left them soft and smooth. I also like that the color is muted and not too strong. It's just a nice sheer color lift.
"Please bring back Cocoa!!!! I am so sad that Cocoa has been discontinued! It is the only color I like and will sadly have to start using another brand. I see that there are lots of woman like me who love the cocoa! Please, please reconsider cocoa!"
Please Bring back Cocoa Lip Shimmer I love Cocoa lip shimmer it was the best color ever please bring it back I can't live without it. I'm willing to purchase a case of it at a time. Is there a reason as to why you have discontiued it PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!!!
This product really works You should really try this product because it's done so many wonders for me. My skin feels super smooth and looks so fantastic. For real this is the best thing I've ever used for my face
Bring back Cocoa I see I am not the only person that would like to see the Cocoa color brought back. I was searching every store I would go in - no wonder I couldn't find it! Just wondering why they discontinued it Please bring it back!!!
"NUTMEG is my color!!!!!! Please please PLEASE bring back nutmeg. I have used that color for years, and I am so upset that I cannot find it anymore. Nutmeg looks natural with my olive complexion, unlike some other shades. Please!! Bring nutmeg back."
"Lip Shimmer Burt's Bees: I love your lip shimmers. They are beautiful and fit perfectly in my jeans pocket to carry around all day. Your new colors are beautiful. Thank you for giving us an all natural, wonderful beauty product!"
"Outstanding I was looking for something other than a heavy lipstick and decided to try Burt's Bees Lip Shimmers. I purchased 2 colors. I love them, so ordered several other colors. Looks nice and makes my lips feel good. Stays on too."
"Absolutely Awesome! I will continue to buy this lip shimmer for a long time it's fantastic! Really moisturizing and comes in great colors. I would recommend it to anyone, and I have! Burt's Bees has the best products! (Oh, and it smells great too!)"
"Lip Shimmer, Bring back MERLOT! This is the best lip product I think I've ever used. No more chapped dry lips when using the lip shimmer. I wish you would bring back the merlot color. The plum's to dark for me, the fig's too brown. The merlot shade was perfect."
"Lip Shimmer - Cocoa - My favorite Please bring this color back!!! I have searched high and low for a color that works for me and my lifestyle, and this is the one. Colors are getting too pinky which is not necessarily suitable for some ages and skin color types."
"bring back the nutmeg! nothing compares to the nutmeg. i miss it so! it has been my go-to in my pocket, purse, and desk drawer for ages. i stock up whenever i can find it, hoarding it. but it would make my life so much happier if it were always available."
"My only lip color I've used this lip shimmer for years, in cocoa, and don't know what I'd do if they got rid of this color. ILOVEIT! Not only does it make your lips feel good, but the color is so natural, it's awesome. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Where's the Coco I've been to several stores and can not find the Coco Lip Shimmer. It was the best color of all, as you could carry it with you for use on any occasion for a nice rich, comfortable color accent. Pleeeese don't discontinue it."
Its good I originally lobe the way it smells and feels when I apply it to my skin. It has enough of what I needed. I recommend this to any person struggleing with dry skin!
Lip Shimmers I love the lip shimmers and keep them on me at all times. I used to chew my lips and suffer from terribly dry and cracked lips all winter long. I no longer do - my lips stay soft and supple. And I love the colors - very sexy.
Love the Rhubarb I love the Rhubarb Lip Shimmer. It's the perfect color - neither too bright nor too dull. This lip shimmer stays on for so long. It's like putting on a super creamy chapstick that adds a touch of color and shine to your lips.
"Bring Back Cocoa! Please reconsider the discontinuation of Cocoa Lip Shimmer it is my every day go to lipstick, as well as an evening out. It's perfect in every way, and no other color comes close... Please bring it back- it's perfect in every way!"
"Excellent product! I bought this product in the Fig shade, and it works perfectly with my coloring I have very pale skin and very dark hair, so I only look good in lipsticks that have red, brown or caramel tones, and the Fig shade looked amazing."
"Please Bring back Cocoa I have gone to about 20 different stores looking for Cocoa.... then I thought to go on-line and order, only to find out you no longer sell this color. Please, Please, Please bring back the color Cocoa in the Lip Shimmer. Thank you"
"Great product I have been using the Lip Shimmer for several years now. I like the sheerness of the colors, it glides on well and is not greasy or drying. I also like the numerous color variations they now have. Another great Burt's Bees product!"
"Love this! The simmers are great! They have color and care! Just enough color to be noticable and the moisture is great- not as much as the lip gloss, which is too glossy for me. I feel like I'm taking care of my lips and looking great."
"Please bring COCOA back!! I LOVE Burts Bees Lip Shimmer...but I'm with the others here...PLEASE bring COCOA back to us!!! If I had known that it was being discontinued, I would have bought several tubes before it disappeared!!! Now, I can't find even ONE tube ANYWHERE!! :("
"Best ever! This is the best lip color I've ever used! All other lipsticks (including other Burt's Bees lip colors) dry my lips out terribly, but this one is great! The fig color can be put on lightly for a light look or more heavily for super sexy lips! :D This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Lip Shimmer- COCOA I'm not very happy that Cocoa is longer on the shelves. I know that is a popular color because there were never a lot there wherever I shopped. PLEASE return COCOA to the shelves. It's a really great and versatile color and I am very disappointed.
"9184047162 I loved this product, it took yrs off , an blotches not so noticeable.... plus it left my face feeling so soft and smelling so .. good !! Thanks"
Tingle Me Up The Caramel Lip Shimmer is my favorite go to. The peppermint tingle is all I need to feel fresh and start my day. 100 natural lip color Heck Yes! Thank you Burt's Bees for a perfect balance between coverage and shine. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Wonderful! I really love this lip shimmer by Burt's Bees because it's a cross between lip balm a lipstick. Not too balmy, not too lip-sticky, if that makes sense. The color stays for a long time too. It feels really nice on my lips. I use it all the time! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Cocoa!! gotta have it!! I tried the Cocoa lip shimmer and fell in LOVE! It just ran out, I did finally find another one a little shop - THE LAST ONE ANYWHERE!! Please dont force me to live without this product - it is the best color ever!! You gotta bring it back!!!"
"HELP! BRING BACK COCOA!!!!!!! I have used them all but Cocoa is my all-time favorite. I have a tube in my desk, in my purse, in my briefcase...always at hand. The color is PERFECT! And now, I can't find it anywhere. :( BRING IT BACK PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!! SOON! Thanks!"
"Beautiful color I have gone back and forth for a long time, and finally purchased the lip shimmer in Strawberry. I am so glad I did the color is amazing, not too bright, not too light, but the perfect balance of natural pink. Thank you, Burt's Bees!"
"Great Stuff I don't usually wear lipstick because it makes my lips feel really dry. I'm a gloss girl, but wanted to try something different. I tired the Lip Shimmer I am loving it!!! Now the only problem is choosing what color I want to try next! :0)"
"Best Overall Tinted Moisturizer I love how I don't need to have a mirror to put this on, yet it gives me the color I need in any situation. It isn't too much color, yet just enough to look like I have lipstick on. It also is great moisturizer, and I use it every single day!"
"Hate the Stick I can not stand to wear lip stick, so I opted to give this a try. I can not tell you how much I love this. It's light in wear, doesn't dry out, and feels great on my lips. I use the Watermelon since it's just enough pink to be playful )"
"my go to lipstick Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer is my go to lipstick. I love the Peony shade since it's neutral, so it goes with everything. The Lip Shimmer is great since it's not too heavy like regular lipsticks and the hint of peppermint soothes your lips. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Kissable Lips - Naturally Best moisturizing stick I've ever used. I own several shades - just enough tint to give natural look, without looking made up. Use under lipstick for smooth application or by itself for moist, energized lips. Love the smell and taste."
Really works This is some great stuff for my face cuz I'm old and wrinkly and it makes me look younger I feel 31
Love these I wear Burt's Bees Lip Shimmers every day at work. The slim size fits easily in my pocket and the shimmer adds a pleasant amount of color and keeps my lips soft and conditioned. These are my favorite tinted balm. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Just love Please please don't discontinue the Radiance lip shimmer. I just love it. Give my lips just a pretty natural sheer glow all seasons, without being to frosty looking. The drugs stores put it on clearance and I thought, oh no, it's gone...."
"Better than lipstick I use Raisin nearly every day. It never looks fake or overpowering, and it seems to last a long time. I hardly ever wear regular lipstick anymore, this is just such a lovely improvement. Will definitely have to try other shades when this one runs out."
"My favorite lipstick Smooth and not greasy with a light, minty scent. It comes in so many shades my favorite is Peony you're bound to find your own favorite!"
Still the Best I found this lip shimmer on vacation several years ago in a tiny antique store...my lips were chapped and i needed something fast! this lip balm is fantastic!! it gives my lips nourishment as well as shine and color. Still the Best!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Wonderful It glides on so smooth and is very moisturizing. The color is more vivid than I expected. I've tried two colors, fig and rhubarb, and I love them both but I'm still looking for my perfect signature Burt's color. I'd love to see a nude hue become available!"
"Wonderful product Most lip colors dry out my skin, and I have a very hard time finding a product that my lips will tolerate. The lip shimmer keeps my skin moist, and I love feeling like I've dressed up a bit by having color on my lips. It's a great option for a lunch date! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Favorite of All I've tried many many many types of lip products and this is my absolute favorite. Wonderful lush appearance and Toffee is Amazing. I love Toffee --- Great color and very unique, but am unable to find that color in the store any more. Does anyone know why"
"Versatile Choice I have these lip shimmers in 6 different colors, and I have never found a shade that would not work for me. I love the fact that they are not heavy like lipstick, and even my tomboy sister loves them when she has to wear make-up in stage productions."
Love How It Looks and Feels I love both the look and feel of the Lip Shimmer! It goes on so easily and stays on for quite a long time. I like that it doesn't look or feel too thick like traditional lipsticks. Once I tried this I decided I will never go back to traditional lipstick!
"What happened!! I've been using this product for years and it was terrific. This improved formula is terrible. It doesn't have the hydrating power it had -- it's much thinner and stickier. Heaven help you if you get some on your lips - it tastes terrible! PLEASE dump this improved formula. Until then, I'm shopping for a new moisturizer... alas"
A daily MUST!!! I have tried everything from all natural to high end designer cosmetics. This is a rock solid product that does it claims!!! It's been part of my regiment for over ten years. I regularly try other products but it's always a waste of time and money!
"Moisturizing Lip Color I cannot use normal lip sticks because my lips get dry and cracked. With this, I can have some color while moisturizing my lips. I'm Asian, and I use Caramel for natural peachy color, Watermelon for natural pink, and Raisin for more dramatic color."
All Time Favorite!!! So excited to know that Burt's Bees' is bringing back my all time favorite color Cocoa. I quit wearing lip color after they removed it from their line. I will be sure to stock up on the Cocoa Lip Shimmer this time around. Thanks!!! for bringing it back.
"perfect for everyday I use the Lip Shimmers all the time for both work and running errands. The colors are fresh, the balm moisturizes and there is no greasy or waxy taste/smell. My skin is a light olive tone and the colors usually worn are caramel, toffee, cocoa and merlot."
"LOVE this stuff! I got this as part of a Christmas gift one year and LOVE it! I always make sure I have this in my purse. Not only is it moisturizing, but it looks great, too! And it lasts a long time, I only have to reapply it after eating or drinking. Best stuff EVER."
Cocoa and Toffee BOTH GONE It is hard to believe that both of these colors are gone. I just read the reviews and I am not the only one who feels this way. Please bring back these colors. They are so easy to wear and I love the way the lip shimmer feels on my lips. Great Colors!!!
"Favorite Lipstick I have been making the switch to more natural and cruelty free products, and Burt's Bees is my go-to for lip products. This one has become my new favorite lipstick. I own several colors. They look great, keep my lips soft, and I love layering with the lip glosses too. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Best in Class I absolutely love this stuff. It has replaced all of my other lip balms and glosses and I wear it almost on a daily basis. Some of the shades are deceptively bold my favorite being Watermelon. Improves the condition of your lips. It's like a double-shot of beauty plus care.
"OUTSTANDING!!!!! this is my absolute forever color!! immediately you notice a difference in how soft your lips are. The color is very sheer, which allows me to go a little outside my comfort zone and pick a darker color. I chose FIG and at first I was nervous, but it is SOOOO pretty!!"
so shiny!!!!!!!! i bought a lip shimmer in radiance and i love it!It is really shiny wit some color but not so much that its overwhelming and fake looking.I love how it doesnt taste disgusting.It tastes like mint and smells clean and minty too! I would definently reccomend tis to a friend.
"Pretty good! This looks great (and when you get a few different colors you can combine them, which looks pretty cool) but I find it doesn't last long and isn't very moisturizing. To fix the moisturizing issue I put the lip shimmer over BB's beeswax chapstick and it works like a charm :)"
"Olay moisturizer I have used Oil of Olay off and on, but I always go back to Olay. I use everyday under my make-up and many times as a night time moisturizer. My skin looks smooth and I have very few wrinkles or lines."
Love the tingle I love the tingle and my favorite colous are Watermelon and Caramel. I have ordered others to check them out. I also was wondering if you would make this format for men but with now shimmer or colour. The tingle feels great on the lips but men don't like the sparkle.
"Cocoa is delicious! I love the Lip Shimmer product, and have a couple colors, but, I too, along with many other Shimmer lovers, wish you'd bring Cocoa back. Its dark and delicious. Please consider bringing it back, or treat us to a new shade of brown. Love it and miss it! Cheers, Cookie"
OMG - Cocoa!!!!! Thank you - Thank you- Thank you - My Color is back and I am so excited!!!! I have used this color for years and was getting down to my last 2 tubes. I used to look at the stock in every store just hoping to find some more....I don't need to look anymore - yippee!!!!
Bring Back Cocoa I love your product and have been buying cocoa lip shimmer. Unfortunately I have not been able to find it recently. I have tried other shades but have not found a shade that I like as well as cocoa. Is there a chance that you will bring this back in the near future.
"COCOA LIP SHIMMER PLEASE PLEASE BRING BACK COCOA LIP SHIMMER, I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANYTHING THAT COMPARES TO THIS PRODUCT. YOUR OTHER COLORS ARE FINE TOO BUT I USED COCOA EVERYDAY FOR YEARS.. FROM ALL THE COMMENTS ON HERE I WOULD HOPE THAT SOMEONE IS LISTENING AND BRINGS IT BACK.."
"No more chemical lipstick I absolutely love lip shimmers. The color lasts all day. When I put the lip shimmer on, it feels like I'm putting on really good quality lip balm, but it looks as sophisticated at any lipstick I've ever used. I won't ever buy lipstick again. Only lip shimmer for me!"
"Love this product I love the lightweight color, shine and the tingle it gives my lips. Keeps my lips moist and I take it with me everywhere. It's also great that it's 100 natural unlike so many other lip balms/gloss. The only thing that could make it better was if it had SPF protection."
"Cocoa Lip Shimmer It's been over a year now, and I'm still desperately missing your cocoa lip shimmer. I've tried at least a dozen substitutes, and nothing comes close. Maybe you could consider the limited release of discontinued colors on an annual basis. The demand is certainly there."
"Miss the coffee shade!! I love the feel of the lip shimmers, a perfect blend of color with moisturizing but none of the colors are as flattering on me as the discontinued coffee. Please bring back the shade of coffee! I've tried most of the new shades- they're all lovely but none compare!!!!"
"Happiness I ended up getting three of these Radiance, Champagne, and Watermelon. And I love them all. They instantly make chapped lips soft and shimmery ad they smell like mint. Champagne is my favorite because it's a very light pink and it's more shimmery than the other two."
Moisturizes well It moisturizes well. I could see the difference within a couple of days. It is slightly heavy so I only use it a night.
"Great 2 in 1 product! I have been a fan of these for a long time, love that they add new colors all the time. This works as a great moisturizer, as well as adding slightly more than a hint of color to my lips. I carry one in my purse at all times! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My favorite lipwear This is all I use on my lips. My lips are so moist from this product. I have one at work, one in my purse, and one at home. I don't ever want to be without this lipwear. I ride a motorcycle and this stay on a long time so my lips never get chapped from the wind."
Crazy for Cocoa Your current pink pallet does not suit me. My daughter and I are crazy for cocoa. Obsessed with this lip color. I look in every town I visit hoping to find some out-of-the-way stash. When will we see Cocoa Lip Shimmer back on the shelf
"Please bring Toffee Lip Shimmer back! I have tried in vain to find my favorite Lip Shimmer: Toffee. So... I thought I'd come directly to the source, Burt's Bees, only to NOT find it here, either. Have you discontinued it Please say it ain't so. has it just been renamed"
missing colors. :( I love Burt's Bees lipshimmers.. 99.9 of the time it is the only lipstick I wear. I do miss two colors in particular that I hope come back one day.. they are Nutmeg and also Merlot. I hope you consider bringing them back.. soon..
Lip Shimmer I am begging with everyone else.....PLEASE bring back COCOA!!! I LOVE this shade and have been going crazy trying to find one last one....Why oh Why would you discontinue it!! I have tried other colors and they are just not the same!!
Great Product This is my favorite lipstick. It's great to have a lipstick that moisturizes at the same time. I love the way it feels on my lips - that I can feel the peppermint penetrating into my lips and eliminates the chapped lips I regularly get.
"Use it Every Day I love Burt's Bees lip products and use them every day. My only complaint is that I wish there were more natural colors in the lip shimmers, (like the lip tint Tiger Lily or Honeysuckle.) The only natural(ish) shade I can use is Peony."
Excellent I love this lip shimmer. it is great and smooth on your lips and i love the tingling sensation it gives your lips the moment you put it on. i would recommend this product to anybody who wishes to have nice smooth and moisturizing lips.
"Great Product These color your lips so beautifully, and provide the Burt's Bees delicious care. Won't dry out your lips or get old-looking like lipstick. Doesn't wear long, but it feels so great you won't mind replinishing. My favorite shade: cocoa."
Product feels good Very smooth to skin relaxing. It leaves a sensation that revitalizes the youth inside the skin
A Radiaint Pair of Lips with Radiance Lip Shimmer I have used the Radiance Lip Shimmer before and I absolutely love it. It's perfect. It still leaves your lips their natural shade but it's so lightweight and moisturizes nicely. Your lips will definitely thank you once you give this a try. You won't regret it.
"Cocoa Lip Shimmer How many people have to request Cocoa to come back before it can happen Even if you only offered it online, it would sell out . I have tried several of the other colors and they just do not look good with my fair skin type. Please bring Cocoa lip shimmer back!"
"Love the Peppermint This is now my favorite lip shimmer, because it has peppermint in it. My lips are very dry, and I need to reapply lip shimmer (or Burt's Bees Ultra Conditioning Lip Balm) every half hour or so. This lip balm feels so good on my lips. Plus, the color is lovely This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Awesome New Colors!!!! I wear these all the time and while shopping last night I found 3 NEW COLORS (woo hoo!). I purchased Cherry which is a deep coral/apricot color, Plum which is a medium to dark plum and Strawberry which is a light pink. These new colors rock! Thanks Burts Bees!"
"Love Cocoa Am so thrilled to have Cocoa Shimmer back and when I can buy it at my local stores again things will be as good as they were before Cocoa disappeared from the scene. Thank you, thank you to Burt's Bees for listening to the needs and wants of your customers. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great stuff Burts bees is the greatest products I've ever used. Would highly reccomend. The lip shimmers do not stay on all day but they do moisture lips very well. Fig is a really good one and it tingles a little bit. Love the color. Its not too pink but not too brown.
Favorite lip color ever Love the lip shimmer. Thank you SO much for bringing cocoa back! Now it just needs to be back in stores! It is the only product I have used for several years. Had to switch to clear because I didn't like any other color on me. Thanks again for cocoa's return!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"CUSTOMER SERVICE PLEASE BRING BACK COCOA!!!! I have looked for the color COCOA everywhere for the last year, it is the BEST color ever!!! Now that I have seen so many comments on how many of us love the color, how can you NOT bring it back.... PLEASE SOMEONE FROM BURTS BEES NEEDS TO READ THIS!!!"
"BRING BACK COCOA!! I love Burt's Bees but you discontinued COCOA and it was the only one color that worked for me and I speak for several of my friends also. As I said we love that color but now have to look into other producs for a color match! PLEASE, PLEASE bring back COCOA!"
WHERE IS NUTMEG!!! I am SOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed nutmeg is gone!! BRING IT BACK PLEASE!!!!!! I used this color every day! It went with my skin tone perfectly and I do not like any others! I guess you'll be losing another loyal customer as mentioned in other reviews I've read.
This product feels very silky Very silly feeling but not oily. Has a soft clean smell to it.
My favorite lip balm with color This is so nice. It adds just a little color with a shimmer or shine to my lips. I guess it just makes me feel a little dressier or prettier really! It feels nice too - not dry like some lipsticks. I really love the glossy shimmer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Favorite Ever I love this stuff! My favorite color is Papaya and it looks good on everybody. All my friends ask to borrow it and I love it! It lasts a long time and has the best color ever. It lasts long and makes my lips soft and smooth. This is way better then lipstick.
"I love your Nutmeg, and can't find it anywhere! I've been looking in all the stores for Nutmeg Lip Simmer unsuccessfully, and so I came to your site today. I'm so sad to see you don't carry it anymore. PLEASE start carrying it again! I join with the others that love it and can't find a replacement for it!"
COCOA I want to 2nd everyone's reviews on the cocoa lip shimmer. PLEASE PLEASE bring it back. I too went all over town buying every one I could find when I heard it was discontinued. Please help a sister out and make it again. I've been wearing it for years!!! Nothing else will do!!!!!
NEED NUTMEG NOW!!!!! Please bring back NUTMEG lip shimmer. I've tried to find another product near this shade.....without any success. Nothing compares to Nutmeg Lip Shimmer. I always bought in bulk and will do so again if you will bring it back. Please.....Please......Please bring back NUTMEG!!!!!!
"Where is the Coffee Lip Shimmer I love the lip shimmers! Coffee is just the best color ever. The Coffee color has the right amount of every tone to match my olive skin and dark hair. It is so sad that I can't get it anymore. If it is discontinued, please contact me to tell me which color most closely matches."
"Why discontinue cocoa I have enjoyed Burt's Bees products for years without complaint. Now my only complaint is the discontinuation of the cocoa lip shimmers! I have tried a couple of the other colors and they're nice, but nothing compares. I hope there is enough feedback like this to bring it back!"
"Why didnt i think of this sooner!!!! I have been looking everywhere for my cocoa lip shimmer, but it is ALWAYS sold out !!!! then i had an idea, order on line , yea!!!!! so excited to get restocked in my cocoa color!!! :) Absolutely the best color and the best moisturizer out there. Please dont stop making this."
Rhubarb is my fav! I lost this lip shimmer and looked EVERYWHERE for it! IT was sold out in every single store. I ordered it from here because I love that it keeps my (super dry) lips moist and also gives it some red color. One of my favorite and necessary products to have with me every day.
"Refreshing One of my favorite lip gloss. I have the Rhubarb, love the color...leaves lips soft and shimmery without that goopy feeling. Added bonus Freshens breath with the peppermint oil, but not overpowering. Love the fact it's natural and I'm not putting unknown chemicals on my lips."
Great product This is a great product I even use it myself . My household won't even use anything else if it isn't olay brand.
"The Best Lipstick EVER!! I have used Lip Shimmers for years. Of course, I have my favorite colors, and feel it is necessary to use the testers in a store, for true colors on your skin. These are the only lipsticks I use. I especially like the peppermint flavor, and feel the peppermint plumps my lips. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Please Bring Back Cocoa!!! I've tried colors other than cocoa, and none of them work for me...it was such a beautiful shade that I carried with me *everywhere*. I put on a light coating during day, and a heavier coate for a more dramatic look when going out at night. It was perfect and it is very missed!!"
Great Purchase Lip Shimmer is great and I like the feel of it on my lips.
I Want More I am upset at myself for discovering the greatness of this product just now. It lasts longer than other Burt's Bees lip balms. I also like how the color of the lip shimmer is subtle on my lips because I hate color exaggeration. I am definitely going to purchase this again.
Where is the Toffee!! I absolutely LOVE the toffee shade and is the only thing I wear. It is impossible to find this shade in stores and is currently sold out on-line. I also have friends that love this color and are in need of a new supply! When will this be back in stock I am on my last tube!
Love this product! The Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer is so perfect for me. It helps to moisturize my lips and works great as a lip color! The shimmer lasts for hours without being retouched. It also soothes your lips when they are chapped. LOVE this product!!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"I Love This Product PLEASE bring back NUTMEG Lip Shimmer! I used that shade for years and cannot believe it is no longer available in the stores. Although I use other shades, NUTMEG is my alltime favorite. Please bring it back! Is there anywhere that may still have some available Please..."
"Best lipcolor ever used I love this lipcolor, it smells great and feels wonderful on my lips. I have tried many brands but Burt's Bees is the best Now, I will never use anything else."
"Where is Cocoa I LOVE the cocoa lip shimmer and search for it at every store I visit that carry's the Burt's Bee line of products. After visiting this site and learning that it has been discontinued (through another review) I am sad. Please consider bringing it back, even if only as a Web site exclusive."
Best lip shimmer ever I do not wear lipstick because it clumps gets on my teeth and feel like it dries my lips out. Champagne shimmer is amazing! I love the way it gives my lips the tiniest bit of color and goes on so smooth! It moisturizes also! What an amazing product! Thank you! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Good product Product is very nice and works very well got it when worked at factory and my skin had bad reaction to the oil we were using there. It cleared up rather quickly had made my skin feel amazing.
"Bring back Cocoa Lip Shimmer! I love, love, love the cocoa lip shimmer! Please bring it back! I have tried other shades in the lip shimmer, but I don't like them nearly as much. I also have tried other products that are close to the same shade and they don't have the same refreshing feel on my lips. BRING COCOA BACK!"
"Great product! I have had several of these, and they feel so good on your lips. The tinted color is nice, but it has a nice cooling sensation. I don't have to reapply as often as with other brands. This is a very reasonable price for a product that will be used all the time! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
love lip shimmer I love the lip shimmer.. so much that I can't stand the way regular lipstick feels on my lips now.. I have almost every color and wear it every day! I feel good knowing it is good for my lips and there are no synthetic ingredients.. Keep up the good work Bur's Bees! LOVE your products.
"I love this! This lip shimmer gives just enough color to be a lipstick! It glides on so smoothly and I love the feel of the zing on m y lips! It really moisturizes, - no more chapped lips for me! I can't wait to try new colors, but this is probably going to be my go to color! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Bring Back Cocoa Where is Cocoa It was my most favorite lip color and looked great with anything! Why did you discontinue it Please bring it back. I have just run out of my last tube after stashing several around my house. Do you have any hiding in a back room of the warehouse somewhere, please"
I Miss Cocoa I recently tried to purchase more of my favorite Lip Shimmer *Cocoa* only to be disappointed in finding out that this shade has been discontinued!!! I can't believe it...Please bring back Cocoa. I have been wearing it for years and get many compliments on it. It is the perfect color!!!
"Cocoa lip Shimmer Thank you Thank you Thank you for bringing back this color!!! I missed it dearly and was so over joyed when I saw it was available again. So over joyed that I ordered 5 at the same time, just in case. Please don't make that mistake again but stopping the production of this color!!"
"Good find I was hesitant to use it because I thought it would make my lips look almost white. I was pleasantly suprised. The natural shade of your lips shows through fine, it just makes your lips shimmery, and not glittery. It's excellent at moisturizing your lips and lasts. Great for everyday."
"so sad about the missing colors I've been using both the cocoa toffee shades for years. It is the only thing I ever put on my lips! But when I went to restock this week, I searched 7 different stores that carry BB products, and cannot find the two shades I use. Are they being discontinued that is so disappointing!"
"Awesome Colors Awesome product and great colors! Really like all of your dark colors. Would also like to request that you bring back Cocoa as well. The best true brown shade in lip color anywhere. PLEASE bring it back! Also, love the new plum color. Nice deep red color. Keep the dark colors coming!"
Amazing product This product leaves my face smooth and glowing and smells super nice i just love it
CANT WAIT TO BUY MORE!!! I got this in Caramel and I adore it. This product is worth every penny! My sister who is in Japan complains about dry lips constantly I cant wait to send her a gift box with all the products. This is the best product out there. All the other products that charges 5x's as much do not compare!
"Cocoa Lip Shimmer This is my favorite color that I used nonstop until they stopped making it for the season. I saw that it came back last week and yet is sold out again. Please bring it back and anyone that knows how I can get some, please let me know as Customer Service simply advised me to check the web page daily."
can't live without it I started using this lipstick because I didn't want anything artificial in my makeup. Now I use it because it the best for my lips I have ever used. The color is great and the moisture keeps my lips feeling smooth. you can use two different ones to get the color you want. You won't be disappointed.
"Love this! This is one of my favorite lip products at the moment! I own peony, and I plan to buy more very soon. The color is very sheer, yet it gives my lips a gorgeous hint of color and shimmer. I am absolutely in love with the way it makes my lips feel, also. The slight minty tingle is absolutely amazing!"
"Love this stuff! 3 I have been using lip shimmer for years. They have so many great colors to choose fromI have many of their colors! Great for stocking stuffers or Easter baskets too! Lip balms are everywhere in my house too. Desk, purse, nightstands, and bathrooms! Would definitely recommend. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Lip Shimmer I am addicted to this lip shimmer. I discovered it when I was on a cruise after my lips were severely sun burnt. My girlfriend gave me hers and I immediately received relief. When I got home from the cruise I purchased several tubes and have been a loyal customer every since. GREAT product.
"Cocoa Lip Shimmer, Please Cocoa Lip Shimmer IS my color. I've looked for years for the perfect color for me. It changes over the years, but this cocoa has been mine for several years. I always get positive feedback and I love how it glides on...and looks with other makeup or without...it's the best. PLEASE bring it back."
"Lip Shimmer Tastes and Works great! I am not a fan of lipstick, but I love the subtle color of Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer. My lips feel soft and moisturized, while not being too showy and unreal with bright lipstick. Just enough shine and color to look great, but not over the top. They also taste great and not like chemicals! Love it!"
"Best Lip Product on the Market My favorite colors are TOFFEE and COCOA!!! Forget the overpriced, overrated lip glosses, sticks, plumpers and stains - This product does it all. A lot of moisture, a ridiculous amount of shine and a quality that actually makes your lips look larger by the amount of lustre that is produced."
"Lost without it! I have this product with me always. If I am leaving my purse behind in the car - this still goes into my pocket. I love the colors, its slim, I love the peppermint feel and smell upon application, and the product consistently smooths my lips without causing 'in-between-applications' dryness. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Productivity Makes your skin so soft and has the best smell. If product is applied as directed then results should be positive
"Oh,No! Yes, please bring back the Toffee. It is my favorite color. This is the 2nd time BB has discontinued my favorite color. Last time it was in lipstick. I think the last color was Coffee(It's been a while). That one lasted all day too. Please don't discontinue Toffee. I wear it year round."
the best! The merlot lip shimmer is the only thing I use...I have never found a lip color I love this much! It is healthy for my lips but adds just the right amount of beautiful color as well. I wish I could find the merlot at stores...I have to order it from the website...so I order 5 at a time.
"Perfect POP for your lips! I love the Watermelon tint...and so many others do too! I had finally run out (after constant use for nearly a year!!), and it wasn't easy to find this color. It's so perfect that I apply without a mirror most times, and it looks wonderful...love it!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Gotta Have Raisin .. and I cannot find it. Not even on your own website. This delicious color allows me to wear RED without looking overdone. I love my Burt's Bees lip shimmer in RAISIN. I have been looking all over for it. Other shades look insipid in comparison. Lovely tho they are, they are not RED. Help!"
"This is how lip color should be! I was never a fan of lipstick because it seemed no matter what the brand, it was always heavy and wore strangely on the lips. This stuff is the total opposite. It's smooth, glides easily, morturizes, isn't sticky, doesn't feather and the color is just perfect for my lighter skin tone."
"Stands up to Soccer and Sun Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer is the best ever. I play soccer and when out there your lips can get dry do to the sun. I tried several lilp balms and lip glosses, none really helped as they would disappear. But, Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer stays with you and keeps your lips protected and looking good."
Blow a Kiss to Burt's Bees for this... I got this product first in Watermelon and fell in love. I was caught constantly putting it on even though the color was still there. I put BB'S Beeswax Lip Balm on first and then the Lip Shimmer and then a light gloss for a sweet look. This Christmas I'm hoping to see some different shades in my stocking!
"Nice color...and a burst of cooling mint Moisturizes well, looks good (even the wrong shade wasn't too wrong and easily corrected by adding another shade) and I do like, as I keep stating, the little cooling burst of mint on the lips. I put the radiance shimmer over this during good weather, and put it over the medicated balm in the winter."
"Missing Nutmeg I love this product but have been disappointed that I can't find the Nutmeg shade anymore. Has it been discontinued If so, please bring it back. Also on the Shadefinder page, there is no option for gray hair. What about us older, au natural women"
AMAZING ! I bought Champagne and i love it ! It adds wonderful color and the peppermint oil makes your lips feel great ! I am definetly going to buy the rest of the colors ! i love these and i use them everyday ! Im a 13 year old girl ! i love burts bees products the best ! i don't use any other kind of lip stuff !
Youthful look with Play moisturizer or if My life changed as my face started to glow. Everyone wanted to know the secret... Wasn't a secret after all. Women like sharing beauty tip. I look younger and feel confident.
"Perfect for me I've been trying to get away from my Avon lipsticks, and this is a WAY better product! I am picky about the ingredients I put into my body and ON my body. This is natural and I love the Merlot and Raisin shades. My only complaint is that it doesn't last too long, especially after eating and drinking."
It's a Bee--utiful World This lip shimmer is so smooth and easy to apply. It makes your lips shimmer like the reflections of rain on a rooftop. The color stays on beautifully and the scent and touch of zip makes it a pleasure to wear. I have this in the color raisin and it is glorious for all seasons and all complextion colors.
More than I expected! I had a coupon to try this new product and it was more than I expected!! The color was great and long wearing but there was more!! The way it felt was creamy and soothing at the same time....i was not expecting the soothing so it was an added bonus! I love this stuff! Cant wait to buy a different color!!
My All Time Favorite!!! I could not live without this product. I am a busy mom who needs make-up hands down. Waking up at 6am every day and shooting out the door with two children I must have this lip shimmer on hand. No matter what I always wear this and mascara! My favorite color is Nutmeg! I have one in every possible place.
"perfect mix of color and moisture! I was always told to wear lipstick, but I hated the feel of lipstick, and the stickiness of lip gloss so this was a god sent! I reccomend it to everyone and anyone!it makes my lips so soft and supple and gives the perfect look of natural and subtle color and shine. my favorites are watermelon and peony."
"Where Are My Favorites These are the best lipsticks I have ever used in my 56 years! I am devastated that you don't have nutmeg and papaya anymore, and now I can't buy them because you have shades that only look lousy on my redhead coloring....I have tried every single one. PUHLEEEEZZE bring nutmeg and papaya back!!!!!!!"
Cocoa Please bring back Cocoa shimmer! Nothing looks or feels better on my lips.I have everyone I know looking to see if possibly they run into it at a store to buy me a bunch...unfortunately no one has. Idk why it was taken off the shelves but with so many people that like it I hope you will bring it back!!!
"My Favorite Lip Product Ever!!! This is the best lip product I have ever used, and there have been many! I love that this shimmer has the beneficial properties of the regular Burt's Bees Lip Balm, but has the added bonus of wonderful color!!! The Toffee shade is my favorite! I hope you never stop making it! Keep up the good work! :)"
"Fantastic Product! I purchased this lip shimmer in Fig. I LOVE it! I layer it over the Replenishing lip balm (shich is great too), and it feels wonderful on. It's light and has a wonderful hint of color without any stickiness or funky flavor. I am definitely hooked on this and other Burt's Bees products! Peace. )"
"I 3 Burts Bees Lip Shimmer!!! The Lip shimmer is the perfect lip balm/ lip gloss/ lipstick compromise. If I had one in every color I probably would never need any other lip products. You are nourishing your lips, plumping with that signature Burts Bees tingle and you don't have to worry about bleeding or any of the other nucences that come with other lipsticks. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Please Bring Back Old Formula It took me so long to find a moisturizer that worked well for me and I loved this product. However, this new formula has a smell that is too strong for me and feels very greasy once applied. Unfortunately I will no longer be purchasing this product and will have to search again for another moisturizer. Please Olay, bring back your old formula. It was so much better."
Amazing I love it amazing on my skin is so smooth nd not crack at all
"My Go To Favorite make Up I have used this Lip Shimmer in Champagne for, what seems like, about ten years and I really like it! The shimmer isn't overwhelming and the texture is smooth and nice. It feels light and has a light peppermint scent. I like that the color mostly compliments my lips, Day or Night giving only a little tint. Luv it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"PLEASE BRING BACK COCOA The lip balm is an awesome product. Moisturizes with that tint of color. But not everybody looks good in bright colors. Some of us look better in darkers shades. PLEASE BRING BACK COCOA! As I can see, I am not the only one who feels this way. The other shades are either too light or too pinkish, purply. We need a dark brown shade!!!"
"Can't live without it This is the best lip product I've ever used. I have a problem with dry, chapped lips and in the past a medicated lip balm was the only thing that worked. Now I use this luxurious, all natural product that has a hint of color too, and my lips stay soft and hydrated and line free. I have a tube on me at all times! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Simply Beautiful! I love this lip color because it's not heavy or sticky. I also have naturally dry lips so having the Burt's Bees lipbalm included is an ultimate plus. The minty feel and taste (not that I eat it so it's more of a smell) is refreshing and I never worry about being kissed - I absolutely love it and have it in almost every shade! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"LOVE this product! I had been looking for lip balm without an aftertaste. Fortunately, my local grocery store had a whole display of these new colored lip balms from Burt's Bees. I tried both a pink and a brown tone. The Cocoa shade was just perfect. Great cooling sensation, great color and best of all, no strange flavor (it's flavorless!) --- YAY!!"
"Cocoa Lip Shimmer So glad I found my very favorite Lip Shimmer. Guess where I found it I've been looking high and low for it and when traveling through the Atlanta airport they had a small little pharmacy AND THEY HAD IT. I bought every one they had that had been 3 years ago..........great color for my skin tone. Thanks for bring back, I adore it."
"Wonderful feel on lips Typically I do not like chapstick or lip moisturizers because they leave a residue on your lips, but this one is fantastic - it goes on smooth, smells great and feels great ... just a little tingle! There is a slight shimmer for a natural but beautiful look and it doesn't leave residue behind. I absolutely love it - it's a MUST HAVE!"
"PLEASE BRING BACK TOFFEE!!!!!! I bought three of these online as I could not find it any stores out in retail. I love Champagne but I REALLY love toffee! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE bring it back. I can try cocoa but it may be too dark. I agree with other customers requesting toffee. I keep one in my desk at school, another in my purse but need more. LOVE IT!!!!!"
"Bring back the Cocoa! I have loved the lip shimmers for years, and have a tube of cocoa at work, at home, and in my purse at all times. It was perfect! Why was it discontinued I've tried other colors, and I don't think I'll be able to stay with the Burt's Bees brand as they don't work for me. PLEASE listen to your customers and bring it back. Lisa"
"Usable even for me I always stay far away from make-up with all of the stuff in it that isn't healthy, but I decided to try give this a try and it's FANTASTIC - it lasts for a couple of hours, comes in a variety of shades, and doesn't give my lips any problems. Definitely going to keep using, and going to try some of thier other beauty products."
Wonderful Product I have used this product for years and my skin is supple and has very few wrinkles. People constantly come up to me and comment on what lovely skin I have. I also have people commenting that I look 20 years younger than my actual age. I know my Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream has been a huge help in staying young looking. It is velvety and rich and my skin drinks it in. I love it! My foundation smooths on easily over my Hydrating Cream and my complexion has a dewy glow. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Bring back the Cocoa lip shimmer! I have been searching everywhere for months for cocoa lip shimmer! My online search has brought me here to learn it is discontinued. By reading through the reviews I see many, many, many other loyal users of cocoa lip shimmer are equally dismayed! It was the only lip color I used and LOVED it!!! Please, please, please bring it back!"
"One of my all time favorites! I love the tingly peppermint feeling you get when you get when applying this product. It's like putting on chapstick with a great color. With the different color options it's easy to find some shades to try. I got some last year as gifts and I love it. While not all the shades look great on me, it's easy to find one that does."
"Excellent Lip Shimmers!!! I've been using Burt's Bees Replenishing Lip Balm with Pomegranate oil for awhile now, and I've been loving it!!! So, I decided to buy Lip Shimmers just to try out and I love them even more!!! ) I bought Champagne, Watermelon, and Rhubarb!!! Great colors! Lip Shimmers moisturizes and add color to your lips!!! Great product!!!"
"Can't Go Without I have always used Burt's Bees Lip Balm under my lip gloss, but since I found this, I no longer need the lip gloss. I am a brown, earthy tone girl and I love the caramel color. It is so light and feels just like the lip balm although it adds just the perfect amount of color for me. Another must have in the land of Bees"
Please bring TOFFEE Back! I too would only wear Toffee and everyone always stopped to ask me about my lipstick. I have not found anything that comes close to this shade and look ALL of the time for a replacement. It was so popular why can you not bring it back...even just as seasonal color... I am sure many of us will stock up! PLEASE!!!
Great product I don't like to wear lipstick (or pay the price of lipstick) but know I look better with a little color. This little stick solves the problem by giving me that color painlessly. It doesn't dry like some lipsticks and has the lovely peppermint flavor. I would apply lip balm anyway so I am glad it comes with some color!
COCOA THANK YOU SO MUCH for bringing Cocoa back! I get SO many compliments when I wear it. It is my absolute favorite color!!!
"COCOA! COCOA! COCOA! Please, please bring back Cocoa Lip Shimmer!!! I've hooked all my friends on this and then you discontinued it! It is the perfect color for wearing on its own, layering with other colors and so on. I get more compliments when I wear this than any other lip color I own. Please, I'm begging you...bring it back!!!"
"BRING BACK COCOA TOFFEE!!!! You all missed the boat on this one. Why doesn't whomever made the poor decision to discontinue Cocoa and Toffee ante up to their error and bring it back! You have endless reviews asking same. In my close circle of ten friends, five used Cocoa! Seriously ... please bring it back. Your new colors are NO match."
Lifesaver I was on a cruise and some how ended up with sunburnt lips. A friend I was traveling with gave me her Burt's Bee lip shimmer. I used it and boy what a life saver it was. It not only kept my lips moist but covered up the ugly spots from the sun damage. Since the cruise I have purchased this product multiple times. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Regenerating Cream I loved this product. My skin was so soft and fresh looking. It took years off of my look. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Favorite all-time gloss! I absolutely LOVE this Lip Shimmer. It is great to have in my purse or even small enough to put in a jeans pocket for on the run. It looks great, feels great and smells great. I love that it adds some color, while moisturizing my lips. Burt's Bees' Lip Shimmer is the best all-around color gloss in the market!"
"3 this! Cocoa lip shimmer is the absolute perfect shade of lip color! It is neutral enough that it can be worn with any makeup and clothing color combinations, yet has just the right amount of color to really make your lips pop!! The texture and tingle are just added bonuses. So happy BB brought this shade back!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Chapstick and Lipgloss in one I really like the Burt's Bee's Lip Shimmer. I have the watermelon one. My lips chap very easy and I prefer glosses to lipsticks when I need to be more made-up. But, lip gloss tends to dry out my lips. This doesn't happen with the lip shimmer. The product also feels and smells nice. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Feels and looks great I love lip shimmers. They feel great on. It is the best of both worlds. You get the tingle and moisture of a Burts Bees lip balm with the color and shimmer on top of it. I keep these in my purse as my everyday go to lip colors. I wear other items but always go back to these. I highly recommend lip shimmers!
"Addicted! I have been using these lip shimmers practically since they were first introduced. A former lipstick wearer, I prefer wearing strong colors and hope that I will never be forced back to standard lipstick again. For such a glossy product, it has remarkably long wearability and feels so natural. Thanks, Burts Bees!"
"It's my go-to product I love the color Peony! I make sure that I have one at home, at the office, in my purse, everywhere. It keeps my lips moisturized and gives me that little bit of color that is so natural. The peppermint tingle is an added bonus. Love this product and use it all the time. Thanks Burt's Bees! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"PLEASE listen to your loyal customers!! PLEASE BRING BACK THE COCOA LIP SHIMMER!! I too have tried every other lip shimmer color you offer, NOTHING works the same. The Cocoa was the perfect neutral color, had lasting power with awesome moisture and never got cakey on my lips. BRING IT BACK BURT'S BEES!!!!!!! (Your loyal customer would be so happy!)"
"PLEASE bring back Cocoa Cocoa has been my go-to color for years. It's the best color for wearing alone, and also works with with lipstick or other Lip Shimmer shades (e.g Plum). Please bring it back. I can see I'm not alone in my disappointment, it appears to be a movement! So please listen to your loyal customers and bring back this favorite. Thank you!"
"Love this stuff............. I just love this stuff. I have it in 3 colors, rhubarb is my favorite. It goes on so smoothly and makes my lips feel so good. It is not heavy or waxy like some products. The tube is slim and fits perfectly in my jeans pocket with no bulge. I live in a real dry climate and my brother even used it once, in a pinch! Great stuff."
"Major Cocoa Deprivation!!!!! When you discontinued Toffee I was miserable...nothing compares, but at least I still had Cocoa!!! I cannot live without Cocoa...I've tried all of your other colors (new and old) but none compare to the timeless, neutral and beautiful color of Cocoa!!! Why deprive all of us of this very popular color I am so depressed!!!!"
"Love This Product This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft, smooth and non-greasy. I like the dispenser as it puts the lotion in my palm without contaminating the unused product by touching it with my fingers. Have found that I do not need a full pump of the product because that is way too much for covering my face and neck. Anyone who has dry skin should not hesitate to give this a try."
"Love the Tingle! I have been buying Lip Shimmer for several years and just love them! I just wish that the colorless one wasn't discontinued. Sometimes, I don't want color, but still love the peppermint oil effect. (Also, nuns cannot wear color I bought the colorless ones for little gifts for them.) Please bring back the colorless Lip Shimmer!"
"Amazing! I literally just put this lip shimmer on for the first time and I absolutely LOVE IT! It made my lips tingle the minute I put it on, it's almost like I can feel my dry lips healing and the moisture absorbing instantly. I also love that they have such flattering colors! I will be purchasing more my next shopping trip for sure :)"
"Peony Lip Shiimmer I have to say that Peony is my favorite color. I have tried all of the colors, including several discontinued ones, and this one is like a great combination of several. For me it is like wearing Caramel, Watermelon, and Strawberry all at once! Thumbs up, and I hope this one stays on the product line for years to come!"
"Peony is my favorite! I have fair skin and don't like to wear lipstick at all since, even the most fairest of shades, look really intense with my complexion. I saw some Burt's Bees at my local grocers and bought the shade closest to my natural lip color, which was Peony. It is the best thing ever and I enjoy the little hint of minty freshness."
"Love it This lip balm is excellent. It really moisturizes and it has a tingly feel with a minty scent. Fig is perfect for me, it looks like my natural lip color, just a little deeper, and it has minimal shimmer. Peony is a pretty pink color with more shimmer. They're both very sheer and don't stick to my hair like lipgloss does."
Never leave home without it! You can't go wrong with any of the colors of this Lip Shimmer. I think I've tried most of them. It's like an addiction! My fave right now is the Caramel color. It adds just enough subdued lip color for everyday wear. Unlike many so called moisturizing lip balms this one truly does keep my lips looking and feeling good! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Toffee Lip Shimmer Please, please bring this color back. I have approached many cosmetic counters in department stores and immediately the first comment is that my lip shade is very pretty. I am ALWAYS proud to say that it is a Toffee from Burt's Bees. I have tried to find a product and color that will be as satisfying and there is none."
"Great Products I have been using BB for years and now cannot find the Lip Shimmer in Toffee, perfect color for me I now have to go to a different product, please come back with the color or tell me where to find it. Love the tinted lip gloss and the eye cream. All of the products I have tried are wonderful. A faithful customer. Gail"
"Please bring back Papaya, Cocoa and Nutmeg Please bring back my favorite colors-Papaya, Nutmeg and Cocoa. I have used these for so long and love them, I've tried other colors and they are not the same. Why did you guys discontinue them I see alot of other people are wanting some colors back, please consider it. I'm not sure what I will use now, I was so happy with these shades-it's all I ever use. So sad!!"
"lip shimmer LOVE lip shimmer! It is the only product I use on my lips. Even during the winter, I don't ever have to use chap stick. It has a refreshing minty scent and flavor and feels really moist and creamy. My favorite colors are watermelon, rhubarb, raisin, and merlot. Looks natural but adds a bit of color. I keep one in my purse, my car and my pocket. LOVE MY LIP SHIMMER!"
Great Moisturizer The best moisturizer I have found. Non greasy. Absorbes quickly and works wonderfully This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great product I love the lip shimmer . I love the way it feels when you put it on. This should be in every girls makeup bag. Its a healthier option than other companies that put lots of chemicals into there make up. The lip shimmer is very similar to the lip balm everyone loves, except that it has pigment. LOVE that Burt's Bees has expanded their products to include makeup."
"Love, love, love it! I thought I was confined to a life without lip color. I break out in blisters using regular lipsticks and lip balms but I have used Burt's lip shimmers for years and have never had a problem. The colors are subtle and blend well with my natural look. I also love that Burt's periodically comes out with new colors to keep my look fresh and seasonally appropriate."
"Can not believe Cocoa is GONE!!! Love the product HATE that Cocoa is GONE! I have read many of the comments and it is obvious that a mistake was made in discontinuing Cocoa!! I sit here with four colors Plum, Fig, Peony, Watermelon and not one of them or even a combination of them even come close to Cocoa. None of them even look nice on me very disappointing. Please bring back Cocoa and SOON."
"Miss the Cocoa lip shimmer Have been using the cocoa lip shimmer for a few years now and have been searching for it the last month, came on-line to order it and am VERY sad and disappointed to find out it is no longer available. I am with some of the others and am begging you to PLEASE bring it back!! No other colors come close. That has become the only lipstick I use other than glosses."
"Bring Back Cocoa!!!! I am scrapping the very last bits out of my last tube of Cocoa and now find out I can't buy it anymore!!!! There isn't a shade even close to it, and its my next favorite after Watermelon. Please bring it back! I have ditched all lip products for just Burt's Bees..... it takes care of keeping my lips moist and not chapped and great hint of color! Love it!"
COCCOA I have shopped for a color for years and fell in LOVE with coccoa! I would buy 2 at a time to make sure I always had one with me. Since I found out that it was discontinued I have tried all the other colors and am very disappointed. I now have started looking at other brands to find what I need since you stopped making the best color ever!! Please bring it back!
"Toss your other lipsticks! I have just thrown out all my other lipsticks, glosses, stains and have purchased only the Lip Shimmers. They apply beautifully, are natural looking and moist and glossy without overdoing it. I managed to locate a couple of tubes of Merlot and Papaya online, which are now discontinued. I wish B.B.'s would get them back in stock, they are both fabulous colors!"
"Great Tints I'm not much of a lipstick wearer, so I was excited to give these a try. I love that they give a natural tint to my lips, nothing to bold. Watermelon and Champange are my favorites for daytime and Rhubarb for going out at night. I like the light texture and the peppermint flavour. It keeps my lips moisturized and makes my mouth smell fresh all at the same time."
Hallelujah!! Cocoa is back!! I am pleased as pie to say the least. However However However this does not mean I can instantly release my grudge and disdain and resentment towards the company for taking it away in the first place. And the years of agony suffering thru dull unflattering alternative lipsticks and shades. But this is a start. Please keep Cocoa and Guava till the end of time.
burtbees lip shimmer i love love this product tried the first time in guava my best friend tried it and loved it so I gave her mine bought other shades rhubarb and raisin and replaced my guava they do exactly what it says moisturizing all day and great natural color with little shimmer and very kissable! oh yeah my cousin took my raisin im so asking Burts Bees for my Birthday !!
"Great Product For A Reasonable Price This is a really good product. It feels light on my skin immediately feels like it's hydrating my skin. I recently turned 60, and many of the people I have told my age to insist that I look like I'm 45! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"where's the toffee I found the perfect color for me from any lipstick I have ever used, toffee lip shimmer. But I can't find it anymore and am so disappointed. It is a great neutral that I would think could go with any skin tone and it has a shimmer to it that lasts and lasts. Probably won't use any of the others, I'll be looking for a diffferent brand untill this comes back."
"Love it!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff! I have used Toffee for over a year and it is the best color for me. I also have the Caramel, which is pretty, but a much more sheer shade. The only thing is, I can't find Toffee in my area. Many places will have Lip Shimmers, but will not carry my favorite shade! I will continue to order it online because I love it so much!!!"
"Finally! After a LIFETIME of searching for the right lipstick (and spending hundreds of dollars on the quest) I have finally found my color. Burt's Bees Plum, it is absolutely perfect, stays on long enough, and doesn't bleed or get all cakey. I love it, and it's so affordable compared to all those expensive designer lipsticks! Thank you thank you thank you..."
love lip shimmers I cant say enough of how much I love the shimmers line but noticed that you have an over whelming response from people to bring back the shade cocoa..that is my favorite shade but also love watermelon..if people are pleading with you to bring back cocoa why dont you exspecially if you know it would be profitable for burts and the customer would be happy..
"Long Lasting and Beautiful I put Rhubarb on after breakfast and it stays put until lunch! I normally reapply traditional lipstick often, since they lose their luster and shine shortly after applying. I love that this goes on smooth and the color really absorbs. This is the perfect product for people who like the shine of a gloss with the lighter feel of a lipstick. Thanks Burt!"
"COCOA DISCONTINUED BIG MISTAKE! I can not believe that you've DISCONTINUED COCOA!! I've had so many compliments on this color and people ask me ALL the time what I'm wearing. So there's some more business Burts Bees is losing. I love this product very natural with a schimmer of color. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, bring back COCOA! Why would you discontinue something that sells so well"
"Suer gots a purty mouf I don't wear a lot of makeup, I think this is a great product, it smells great, lasts a fair amount of time (color wise), and it makes my lips feel amazingly soft. Unlike other lip balms I can use this before I go to bed and it doesn't make my skin break out. I do think that it could have a more powerful mintyness to it like the classic burts balms."
"One of my favorite lip products I absolute adore this product. The color is not too intense, and the minty feel after each application just wakes me up. My lips feel so much softer after using this product. My young daughter found my lip shimmer and too it away. She loved it so much, so I bought her own, so she wouldn't try to use mine. This is great stuff. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Product This is my favorite of all the Burt Bees products. I use it several times a day and it has replaced my lipstick and chapstick during the day. I love the soft and creamy feel of the stick. I bought a case of these and keep one in my car, vanity, and every purse I own. It does not stay on as long as I would like though. The colors are very nice."
"Love my Lip Shimmers I have bought lip shimmers in Peony, Watermelon and Rhubarb and have loved them all. They are light and add just enough shimmer and color. The Peony is also great for applying over other lipsticks to make them sparkle. Lip shimmers are not cakey like some lipsticks, not waxy like some lip balms. They are smooth, soft and I love wearing them. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Works Immediately! I have used several Olay products and have been pleased with them. However when my skin was getting really dry and flaky I knew I needed something hard core. I was amazed how after one use I could tell a difference the next morning! I am so excited! ...Just wish they would give you more lotion for the .
"Please PLEASE Bring Back Toffee!! I LOVE this product, the minty smell, the moisturizer and lip color in one convenient tube for a mom on the go, but I do NOT know what I will DO without my Toffee Color! I too find it to be the one color I come back to all the time, or mix with other colors to make them mine. Please bring it back! I know I am not the only one looking for it!"
"Lip Shimmer - Toffee I am completely addicted to Burt's Bee's Lip Shimmer, color Toffee but I can no longer find it in stores. The color is perfect... not too dark, not too light, it's a nice shimmery brown. I have been to every store in San Antonio and I can't find it, I hope they haven't stopped making that color. The color isn't even on the displays any more."
"Great product! I got this one in champagne and I really like it! The shimmer isn't overwhelming and the texture is nice. It feels good on my lips and has a light peppermint scent. I like that the color mostly matches my lips, giving only a little tint. I actually like the color of my lips, but wanted to give this product a try and I'm glad I did!"
"great colors Love the product!!! This product is really nice because offers the option of having a lipstick and a lip balm in one product for very little money. Easy to carry in the purse, or pockets. Plus, it has a mint scent that makes me feel that my mouth fresh. I got three colors, Peony, Rhubarb, and watermelon, and I must say they look great. Love this lip shimmer!!!!"
"The only lip coloring for me This really is the only lip product I use - I like the plum and neutral shades. I don't need a mirror for the light shade, and I need to always have something protecting my lips in Colorado. It never cakes, or does anything uncomfortable, so I don't need to fuss with it at all - just keep reapplying it as it dries out in the sun we enjoy here. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Lovely Color Like with many Burt's Bee lip products, I love the cooling sensation and with these lip shimmers, love them! I purchased mine in rhuburb and when I applied it, it was slightly lighter than it looks but in the end I still loved it because the color worked really well. The shimmer is natural looking switch is another plus. Hope to get more!"
"Cocoa Pleeeeeeeeeaaaaaasssse! I, along with many many others am wondering why the Cocoa lip shimmer is no longer available. It truly was a universal color that would go with almost anything. I would really like to know if, and when, it will ever be coming back. Thank you for your time. I like the lip shimmer product because it is comfortable and never dries out your lips."
"Bring Back Cocoa Please! Best Lipstick ever! Please bring Cocoa Lip Shimmer back. It is the most perfect lip color, great for all seasons, occasions, refreshing to wear! It is timeless. So many if us are so disappointed that we can't find it anywhere. Please bring Cocoa back. I've tried so many other brands and nothing compares! Please bring Cocoa Lip Shimmer back!"
"Color and Balm in one I love this little lipstick.I am light skinned and use the Peony. As a woman of age, I appreciate a lipstick that moisturizes and gives a subtle color. I find this also stays on pretty well for such a light texture. I love Burt's Bee's gentleness and natural ingredients and will continue to use their products. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Where did Cocoa go My 5 star rating is for the color Cocoa, but it is no longer offered. I am disappointed to learn that you Cocoa lip Shimmer is discontinued. I have been wearing it for years and the other colors do not compare. Please consider bringing it back. Without this color my rating would be a 1 because the colors are just not worth buying. Love the product but not the current colors available."
great moisturizer The best moisturizer I have found. Non greasy. Absorbes quickly and works wonderfully This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"No more Coffee I love B B Lip Shimmer! But, as per usual, when I find a product that I like it becomes discontinued. I currently have Lip Shimmer in Coffee and it appears that when it's gone I won't find anymore. Why oh why I'm starting to feel like the kiss of death to products! Have tried other colors in that color group, but the others don't have the deep color that the Coffee does. Help!"
"Love This Product I purchased this product in Champagne. I love the shimmer and how it sparkles. For not being very thick it lasts a while too, which is great for going out. i don't have to constantly reapply or worry about it wearing off after ten minutes. I love how this product is so smooth and feels like a balm, but still has a lot of color and shine to it. I'm very happy with this purchase!"
"It has to be COCOA As so many have said here already, please bring back Cocoa. I have used it for years and there is nothing else close to it. It was so popular, that way before it was discontinued it was often hard to find. It was the one Shimmer that was first to be go on the shelf at my stores. I got smart and bought more than one when I was able to find it. I have no idea why it would be dropped."
"Nice Shiny Color I really enjoyed the smoothly it applied and the shade was aptly described (Peony) and I was not disappointed with the color choice. It has a subtle sparkle that doesn't make it seem childish for more mature users who like a hint of fun in their face. The moisture is good, I found I needed to reapply about 6 hours to retain the moisture even though the color was still visible. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My Favorite is BACK!! Thank you sooooo much for bringing Cocoa back. I am using my last tube (I stocked up some time ago when they discontinued the shade. Thanks to the on-line outlet.), and I was having a tough time finding a replacement. Look no more. I love the shimmer, peppermint smell, and the way my lips feel. It's the perfect natural color that I often wear it as my lipstick day into evening."
discontinued I'm very disappointed that they have discontinued the lip shimmer in 'Toffee'...i've tried other colors along with the 'Cocoa'..and these two are my favorite...i've been using these lip shimmers for a very long time and the Toffee is still my favorite I still keep looking in the stores hoping that Burt's Bees will bring this color back....please please please.....love them.....
"BRING back COCOA!!!!! I'm joining the crowd...I, too, have looked high and low for more COCOA LIP SHIMMER in stores to no avail! Did you rename it Please listen to the masses...we LOVE COCOA!!! It always seemed low in quantiy in stores--I'm assuming that means it's a great seller! From the looks of these reviews, it was! PLEASE BRING COCOA BACK!!!!! Signed, Customer of COCOA for MANY YEARS!"
"sanr I just took a chance that I could buy the lip shimmer online. to my great surprise I could. Recently I was told that they could no longer be purchased by a dealer. I was soooo happy to find out different. thank you for this wonderful product. It is not only color, but treatment...and it work GREAT!!!! Thank you again and please do not discontinue!! I love all the products!!!"
"So far so good I bought this a few days ago and so far it's working really well. The Nutmeg color is good, even though I am fair skinned and not one to wear lip color at ALL. The mintiness is nice at first but thankfully it diminishes after about a half an hour. My husband likes the color and the smell, and what I like is that it is not lipstick but gives my lips a nice hint of color."
"My Favorite Lip Product! This is my favorite product to wear on my lips! I love the Fig color! Not only does it add color to and moisturize my lips, but it has a 'peppermint-like' scent that is refreshing to smell and also helps your breath smell better to others. It is long-lasting and only needs re-applying after several hours, or after eating or drinking. I highly recommend this lip product!"
REGENERATING DEEP HYDRATION CREAM MOISTURIZER I like its rich dewy thick consistency. Great night cream - won't rub off on pillow! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"WOW! Even my 77 year old Mom is a fan! I gave my Mother your Lip Shimmer in Raison and she loves it! She told me it was one of the best gifts that i ever bought her-and wanted more of them in different colors. She has a bad problem with feathering, and she says that your product looks great all the time and NEVER ends up where it shouldn't go! Thanks Burt's Bees, for making me a hero to my beloved Mother. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great alternative to lip stick and gloss I do not like lipstick it makes my lips feel funny, and lip glass is sticky. Burt's Bee Shimmer is perfect for me. It gives my lips a little tint of color and shine while getting the benefits of a chap stick. I love this stuff and the fact that I put it on and forget its there no sticky or greasy feeling that I get with lip stick or glosses. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Feels great! this feels so nice and has a wonderful peppermint smell! I have only tried Peony so far but will definatly buy in different colors now. It moisturizes while providing just the right amount of color.
"Cocoa lover I can't believe you pulled cocoa lip shimmer. I have used this for years, as have many others. It's always been hard to find (due to high sales), so when I did find it I would usually buy all they had. If you don't bring it back you've lost me as a customer, and I'm sure I will not be the only one. I don't like your other shades, must now find a new product. Thanks!"
"Bring back COCOA!!! I echo everyone else's sentiments: you need to bring Cocoa Lip Shimmer back! I've tried Fig and a couple of other new colors, but they're not even close to Cocoa, which was perfect. If it's not broke, don't fix it! I've joined The Hive in hopes of receiving a message that you've brought Cocoa back. Even if it's for a limited time so that we can all stock up. Please!"
"Shimmering ips Brilliant! Did some genius wake up one morning and say I've got it! Then came the boring focus groups to confirm. Natual women like having soft, pink lips. I discovered your tinted lip products on What Not to Wear when a woman like me, no fuss, no muss, no make-up was given the Burts Bees lip shimmer. Subtle and lovely. Just a smidgen of color. Perfect. Loved rhubarb but all the delicous colors work on my fair skin. Good job! Burt This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Cocoa Lip Shimmer Is is really true that the cocoa lip shimmer is discontinued I've been to store after store in search of it and it's the only color I actually like. I wear it everyday and it's replaced all my other lipsticks. I haven't bought another brand in over a year. If the cocoa is not brought back I will have to go to another brand and stop using Burts Bees. What a shame. None of the other colors work for me. -A VERY UPSET NO LONGER CUSTOMER...
Cocoa Lip Shimmer is the best! I'm addicted to this lip shimmer and I'm so glad Cocoa is back. I'm stocking up!
"Love this Product I love this product for several reasons. I bought this in the watermelon color, which is a light shimmery purple color and it looks really nice on. This lip shimmer balm also holds a slight minty taste which feels nice. In addition, it is very comfortable to carry around in a purse because of its size. Not to mention, the cost is extremely low for such a great product. I recommend it to anyone who likes lip balms. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Shimmy with the Shimmers It's hard to say how much I treasure these little tubes of goodness. They contain an excellent base of moisturizer scented with peppermint oil and are tinted with luscious, elegant colors. On the lips, the color looks very natural - you will accentuate what Nature gave you. There is also a light pink shimmer that is great for those times when you want a little more glitz and glamor. Highly recommended. Treat yourself or a friend."
Skin feels so silky Makes my skin so soft and silky. Will not switch to another moisturizer. Love it!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Radiance is Awesome I love the lip shimmer radiance, it is awesome. I love the shimmer and how it looks against my pale skin. It is also minty fresh and not sticky. Good buy, my favorite lip product that I buy over and over again when I use it up. I use it for all occasions, going out with a friend, going on the beach, on a date or going to bed. It is light yet moisturizing. The best part, its natural and your not putting weird chemicals on your mouth."
"Best Lip Color Ever I love the Cocoa Lip Shimmer. A lot of lip colors turn orange or pinkish on my lips. This holds the true color. Even better, it keeps my lips from drying out in the dry climate where I live. It lasts for several hours, which is great at work when I can run to a mirror every 30 minutes to freshen the color. I'm disappointed I can't find the Cocoa shade in any local stores, but the convenience of ordering it online is perfect."
"Lip Shimmer I am currently wearing this. I have 2 sticks at work, 3 at home, and 2 in my purse. I love it. It feels and looks great, and keeps my lips soft and smooth. Plus it has a very delicate smell that I cant get enough of. I recommended to my mom and she wears it exclusively now. The only problem Ive ever had is that it doesnt stay on your lips as long as other brands so you have to reapply more often, but past that I love it."
"My absolute favorite ever I LOVE LOVE LOVE these lip shimmers. They are incredible. They moisturize, they last all day. They aren't sticky or oily like glosses, and aren't dry and cakey like lipsticks.They have a nice minty feel too. I use them every day. Burt's Bee's, PLEEEEEEASE bring toffee back. It's my absolute favorite color, been using it for years. And you discontinued it! Please bring it back! Would recommend to anyone. Get the shimmers!"
"So disappointed...NO COCOA or TOFFEE! I loved the Cocoa shade...absolutely my favorite. The toffee was running up a very close 2nd place and now I can't get either one of them I've been using these for years!!! I don't like regular lipstick, period. I tried to order the caramel, but of course, there is none! I tried Nutmeg also...there is none!! What is going on here Come on, Burt's Bees... PLEASE BRING BACK THE FAVORITES OF SO MANY OF US OUT HERE!!! Thanks!"
"The only lip shimmer I wear I love these lip shimmers. I've replaced my lipstick with these. They come in great colors (mine favs are Rhubarb, Watermelon and clear). The texture is great. They do not cake in the creases of your lips. Two thumbs up for that! My hubby doesn't mind kissing me with this lip shimmer on either. I don't get cracked dry lips either anymore. I feel that the price is right too because you are getting a lot for your money."
"COCOA Lip Shimmer, PLEASE!!!!!!!!! PLEASE BRING BACK COCOA!! I have searched every drug store and grocery store in a 30 mile radius and cannot find any remaining Cocoa lip shimmers. I have a horrible time finding a lip color that works for me, and Cocoa is perfect I have worn it for years. I receive compliments every time I wear it. I have searched my local makeup chain store and dept stores for a color similar to no avail. PLEASE BRING BACK COCOA!!"
Love! I love that BBs lip shimmer has the smoothness of the label's lip balm yet has the beautiful colors of the fancy high-end name brands. These are great shimmers. I like that some of the shimmers are more sheer while other colors are more intense in shade than others. They are all great. It's great for the day and evening. I also love scent and peppermint flavor. I hate other lip glosses that taste gross on your lips.
"PLEASE BRING TOFFEE BACK! I purchased 10 tubes of Toffee Shimmer before it was discontinued. I am SO devastated that you took it away! Please bring it back...please, please, please! It was my one and only lip color it was the BEST lip color I've ever used. I have searched oodles of other brands, from grocery stores to department stores to specialty stores, and NO ONE has anything even close. This LadyBee is begging for you to bring TOFFEE back!"
"Bring Cocoa back I have used Cocoa lip shimmer for years. When i began having allergy reaction to the color in a previous lipstick, I found Cocoa and fell in love. I have recently discovered that it has been discontinued. I was out of cocoa and needed something so I tried Plum. It is a very garish , unactractive color and causes the same allergy reaction that I had with the previous different brand. Really a huge disappointment."
"new formula is terrible Used to swear by this product as my daily moisturizer. I loved it because it felt thick and creamy and did a great job without being greasy or feeling heavy. However, just bought the first container of the new formula. It's terrible! It leaves a greasy feel that does not go away and makes it impossible to apply makeup, even 10 minutes after. Your skin just feels slimy to the touch, slippery. And the scent is way stronger. Please, OLAY, give us our old formula back!! I'll be purchasing something else."
Great product I use this every day and it has really improved my skin's appearance and texture This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Wonderful Product, but Need Cocoa back! I've never been a fan of lipstick - that is, until I discovered Lip Shimmer in Cocoa. It was the only thing I would use on my lips and my stash is dwindling! Please, please consider bringing back this shade. I've tried the newer colors that are close to it, but I don't like any of them. Sadly, I will not use the product any longer if I can't wear my favorite shade. It's really one of the best products I've ever used."
"Great pick-me-up and lipstick substitute! When I want to feel pretty but not go the whole nine yards, I just swipe one of these across my lips. Not only do they tingle like the original lip balm, but the color goes on well, too. The only one I've had problems with is Papaya...for some reason, that one goes on very unevenly and is hard to blend. I've used Watermelon, Fig (love!), Rhubarb (love, too!), Raisin, Merlot, Papaya, Nutmeg, Champagne, and Radiance."
"TOFFEE, PLEASE!!! I recently found this color - actually I believe I stole it from my daughters make up bag. I have tried other lip shimmer colors, but this is hands down my favorite lip color of any lipstick i have EVER used! ANY...not just Burt's Bees! Please, please, please consider bringing this color back. Maybe for a limited time if nothing else...Christmas Toffee perhaps I will buy 10 tubes and be happy for the year!!"
Perfect lip colors I love the lip shimmers and have multiple colors! I love how small they are because they fit in pockets and small purses and I also feel less guilty about buying so many colors. :) I particularly like how moisturizing they are with just the right amount of color. I have never liked traditional lipstick because it always felt too dry or was a but too much color for daily use. Lip Shimmers are the perfect answer!

"Superior! I've been using Burt's Lip Balm forever. A couple of years ago my sister gave me my first Burt's Lip Shimmer. Never really being the girl that wore a lot of lipstick, I thought well this is interesting .... lip balm with color. I live in Chicago. It is currently 16 F and dropping, with snow on top of more snow, windy and miserable. BUT ---my lips are soft, blemish free, unchapped, and a LOVELY color ....PERFECT."
"One More for the Cocoa I am one of the many that only use the Cocoa Lip Shimmer and would like to see this color returned to the product line. I have used this product for the past six years. I normally have 3-4 extras on hand at any time and as of two days ago I am down to my last tube. The new colors do not work with my skin tone, they have a very orange or pink tone that are nothing like the cocoa.Please bring the Cocoa shade back."
"The Absolute Best Lipstick/Balm Ever Used I have a medium colored skin tone with brown hair, and I love love love Cocoa! The package itself is recyclable so it's green, (not the lipstick. :D) and it helps the enviornment. I love the pigmentation, I can't stand sheer shades. The more lipstick you usethe more you buy, but a nicely-pigmented-one-coat lip balm is lovely because you use less. Overall, it's the most natural, good-smelling way to go. :)"
"Love, Love, Love this product!!! I have been using Burt's Bees products for a few years now, and I love these lip shimmers. I have fair skin, and I love how the rhubarb color compliments me. I have tried the radiance shimmer and the champagne color as well, which I just bought a new stick of :) No other brand of lip color even comes CLOSE to Burt's Bees...refreshing, moisturizing, long lasting color, and all natural...what could be better"
"very nice I love how this leaves a very rich color that stays on. You do have to keep re-applying every couple of hours, especially if you drink anything, but since these are easy to keep in a purse or a pocket discreetly, I'm ok with that. I tried the rhubard color (I'm light skinned with dark hair) and it had such a deep full color. The watermelon was also very nice and had more of a natural color, more enhanced me."
"Essential Honestly i feel i can leave the house in the morining if I have my mascara and my Burt's Bees lip shimmer. I LOVE classic Burt's Bees balm. But this is better for work it's like healthy lipstick, but sheer. My favorite color if i had to pick one is watermelon. I think if you are going to be putting something on your lips you should feel 100 good about whats in it. I feel 100 good about lip shimmers."
Works well This product actually works better than the more expensive creams I've tried This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love this Lipstick The color is just enough, it is not too glossy and doesn't wear off and best of all the peppermint in it makes your lips tingly and fresh feeling. I actually misplaced mine for a month and it was still like brand new when I found it again which I usually don't find with more natural products as they tend to become stale fast. This is not the case with this lipstick. Rhubarb is my favorite color. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Amazing I have always been wary of lip color, but this product is so great. It doesn't chap my lips, doesn't bleed, doesn't settly into those little lines on my lips, doesn't smear out onto the corners, and lasts forever! I have this in Fig, and the picture is inaccurate. In real life, it is much more of a purpley-red shade, almost like a pomegranate. I have really fair skin, and it goes great! I love it! :)"
"BRING BACK COCOA!!! As James Brown sang-PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring back Cocoa!!!!!!! It is the only color that works for me. I wear it casually, as well as on stage (singer). While there is a nice darker color in your lip glosses-I don't like gloss. I have very long hair particularly when performing, it immediately goes to my mouth, esp. if I'm wearing gloss. If you bring back Cocoa, I promise to buy 10 tubes! :)"
"cocoa lip shimmer I have been using cocoa lip shimmer for as long as I can remember years years. When the color was discontinued, I was so upset and bought all the tubes of it I could find locally. I've checked back on the website here there, and just found out cocoa is BACK!! I'm down to just 2 tubes left, and was wondering what I would do thank you, Bur'ts Bees. I love your products and I love this color!!!"
"Loving this!!!! As an avid Burt's bees buyer I'm always exited to try something new, I decided to give the Lip shimmer in Rhubarb a try and I'm thrilled with my purchase!!! The color is perfect just the right shade of red, and it makes my lips super soft. I have used the tinted balm and didn't think it could get any better, but I'm happy to say I was wrong :) If you haven't tried it yet, now is the perfect time :)"
TOFFEE I NEED IT--Puhlease! Please please please bring back toffee--I love it--it is the only lipstick I wear. I too like other reviewers have been forced to use a q-tip to get the remnants out of my old tubes. I have received so many compliments on the color and have turned so many friends on to the wonders of burts bees as a result of my devotion to this product! Have any other posters found a replacement by other brands
"Discontinued....dang! I, like several others, am disappointed that you discontinued the Cocoa Lip Shimmer. It was my favorite of the color choices. It seems like the colors vary every time I go to purchase one of your shimmers. I never know which one to choose, and quite honestly, I don't like most of the colors. Please bring back the Cocoa. It's a great product, but I won't use it if I can't find an acceptable color."
"Awesome Stuff Ok, just to let you guys know, they sell cocoa and papaya and one other shade in the outlet section of the website. Just FYI. By the way, these shimmers are awesome! I have peony and watermelon and watermelon is not as purple as the website makes it look. It is like a darker, pinker version of peony. Anyway, I like the shimmers but they are a bit messy. THey are quite long lasting though. :)"
Really devastated Cocoa is gone I too like so many have posted use Cocoa as a beauty staple! It's the ONLY product for my lips that I can use all day and my lips not suffer from the product - in fact the product takes care of my lips! I have loved this color for years and have had so many compliments. Truly devastated to loose it. Please consider reinstating this color - it's very obvious there is a huge fan base for it!
"Miss Cocoa Color****what happened to this color Love, love Burts Bees! I have recommended it several times! Mostly because of the of the color COCOA!!! Such an awesome, universal color that looks great on EVERYONE!!!! I have been buying it it since 2005. I have tried the other colors, not the .same, don't use them......pleeeeeeeease bring cocoa back!!!!!!! I am not buying any more until I see cocoa again! Thanks! I do love your product!"
product The best moisturizer I have used. The results I have seen are just what I want. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"The best shimmer ever! The entire line of lip shimmers are worth every penny! I got the radiance lip shimmer in this order. I love the iridescent colors in each of them. I even wore the champagne color for my wedding. The thing that is so great about them is that they are not sticky! They go on thin and smooth, but tingle giving you a fresh feeling. They complement any makeup job or can be worn with no makeup."
"A lipstick subsitution I purchased the Lip Shimmer in Rhubarb and let me tell you, i probably will not make any lip stick (or at least stable bright color lipstick) anytime soon! The color is so so vibrant and it goes on the lip so smooth. Bonus: It moisturize your lip all day long!! I will definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a bright lip color but with natural ingredients and does not crack your lips"
"WHYSTOP POPULAR COLORS It seems there are so many of us wondering WHY Nutmeg is no longer offered. I am on my last one and now find it impossible to find a Burt's Bees color to replace it. I am now going to have to change brands and will no longer be a customer...WHY would such a decision be made I do know this is not an uncommon practice in the cosmetic industry, but I thought your company was different."
"Bring Back Cocoa Please Please do reconsider offering the color Cocoa lip shimmer and add it back into your product line. It has been a staple in my wardrobe for many years and love that color. It is disappointing not to find it in stores. It was a very popular color, can you not stand prosperity I hate to walk away from Burts Bees, however will be looking for this lip color. Thank you for your consideration."
The Best on the market I have used this shimmer for years. I love it. I have both my daughters using it also. I love the way it goes on and the fresh feeling it gives my lips. Only bad thing is you stopped making my favorite color Coffee. I really miss it. It was the best color for me. Some are just a little too light for my lips. Thank goodness I have a couple tubes put away. I really love this stuff.!!!!
"FIg!! When Burt's Bees made lip stick, their fig lip stick was my all time favorite. Even though the product line changed, I'm so glad they kept fig as a color. This product gives a nice shimmer and just enough color. Keeps lips pretty and moisturized though out the day. I keep one at my desk, in my purse, in the bathroom, and in my travel bag. That way I'll never be without my fig lip shimmers."
"TOFFEE NO MORE!!! I just had to express my grief over losing the one lip product I have loved forever! No other product out there gives me the shimmer, long lasting coverage and healthy conditioning all in one! If there is any way that Toffee can be given a second chance, I'm sure I'm not the only woman out there that would be extremely appreciative!!! Please please reconsider discontinuing this color!!!"
"Love It I love COCO color....please bring it back. I have been to so many stores in my area looking for Coco lip shimmer and every store is already out of it! I have tried other colors and nothing compares to Burt's Bee Coco.....I am lost with out my lip color!!! Please bring it back! I think if everyone writes regarding Coco they will have no choice to bring it back! Thanks Cathy Branford,Ct"
"cocoa lip shimmer: please listen to your customers I can't believe it's true! I thought it was a fluke at first when I couldn't find my color...cocoa...it's been the only color I've used for 10 years! But sure enough, store after store was out of it. I keep trying to duplicate it. I have even bought other colors and mixed them together to try and get them to look like cocoa. It's no use. Please listen to your loyal customers. I just look terrible in anything else I have tried. This is SUCH a bummer!!!!!!"
Perfection in a stick! I adore this product for two of the biggest reason! reason number one being that it is perfect for any occasion it can be dark it can be light and it has just enough sparkle for night and day! The other reason is that its so moisturizing! I have very dry lip and unlike most chap stick it stays on your lips and glides on so smoothly you can just feel it working! I always love products that give you a bang for your buck and this is one! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Awesome product I love this product, I finally found something that works great on my face!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Yum-Yum Plum I tried Burt's Bees Plum Lip Shimmer for the first time today, it did not disappoint. The color works very well with my cool, practically neon-white skin, is buildabe, doesn't bleed, feather, or migrate at all. It also has a nice sheen to it, and a refreshing, cooling, breath freshening hit of peppermint oil that I always enjoy in a lip product. Plum is not too dark for me, like I thought it might be. I look forward to trying other Shimmers:)"
"Love it! I'm becoming more aware of the products I use on my body and in an attempt to use more natural products, I decided to try this one. I just bought the Lip Shimmer in rhubarb a few days ago and love it! It makes my lips feel so soft and the peppermint oil adds a nice cooling tingle. And the color is great - the perfect amount and type of color to give my natural lip color a boost yet not look unnatural. I would recommend this product to all my friends!"
"Awesome color and feels so good all in one! I've used Champagne, Caramel, Watermelon, and Fig, and I have a few others but haven't used them yet. This is an awesome lip shimmer because even though some of the colors don't look too good on me, they don't dry out my lips and feels good to wear them. It is also long lasting, too. Some lip colors feel sticky the longer that you wear them, but I don't even know that I have the lip shimmer on when I use it."
Love Cherry Raisin Lip Shimmer I bought both colors Cherry Raisin Lip Shimmer. I love the size of the lip shimmer tube and it is very easy to carry in any size purse. The texture of this lip shimmer goes on very smooth and has a hint of peppermint flavor when it glides on your chapped lips. I love the subtle colors of Cherry Raisin used separately but can be mixed together. I highly recommend this lip shimmer and will buy other colors when I run out of these two colors. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Only Lip Product I Purchase I have been using the champagne lip shimmer for a couple years now. I absolutely buy nothing else. I keep one in my car, in my purse, in my desk drawer, and always have one in my pocket. It moisturizes, lasts and works. Only bad thing I can say is it is never in stock at the stores. I have started to buy online and it works fabulously."
"New Cherry Shade I have been using Burt's Bees lip shimmer for about 6 years nonstop. I tend to like the non-metallic pinks and reds such as Merlot, Raisin, and Rhubarb. But the new Cherry shade is the best!!! I would describe it as a perfect coral (non-metallic, of course)!!!! I hope this becomes a Burt's Bees classic because I can see me wearing this until I'm eighty years old!! So classic, so flattering and knocks chap stick out of the water for moisture!"
"Tracked it down) Totally in love with this product! I am a gloss and lipstick addict. This one product has freed me from them all. I love that it has a fresh minty feel with just the right amount of color. No need to use two products any longer. The color lasts and doesn't cake it just gradually fades. I discovered it by accident in a bookstore and then tracked it down on the internet, because I never want to be without it again) Fabulous job Burt's Bees!"
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BRING BACK COCOA!!! I don't understand it. 99 of the reviewers are pleading with BB to bring back Cocoa. How can it be that this was discontinued due to lack of sales Can you at least sell it as a limited edition so your faithful customers can stock up on your best neutral cover ever Your other colors just don't compare...too many oranges and pinks. Even Caramel doesn't match Cocoa's great color. I'm waiting and hoping it returns but not for much longer.
"FAVORITE LIP PRODUCT EVER I have always had a problem wearing lipstick, it dries my lips out to the point that my lips split open. I can wear lipstick for less than 1 hour and have this happen, but not since I began using your lip shimmer products. I show horses out in the sun and heat and the lip shimmer holds up to those conditions, but best of all my lips are in better shape than they were at the start of the day. Thank You for such a safe and wonderful product."
my favourite lip product EVER!!! burts bees is my favourite lip product ever!!!! they are soooo moisturizing and i love how the lip shimmers have that peppermint flavour so when you put them on they tingle soo nicely!!! love that. Also most lip sticks feel really heavy and sticky on your lips... however burts bees lip products feel so nice and light and non sticky. they also have the perfect amount of colour and shimmer. i also love how they have so many choices to choose from. I AM IN LOVE WITH BURTS BEES!!!! WOOOOOHOOOOOO!!!
Great hydration My face is so soft after using this cream. My 60+ skin looks much younger. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Stuck on a desert island This is my MUST HAVE! This is the modern day Tom Boy's lipstick! I never leave home without this lip shimmer. In fact, I've found myself miles away from home and turning around just to retrieve it. The shimmer brightens and the peppermint sends tingles throughout your lips. There are so many different color variations to choose from you can have one for each of your favorite outfits! I love the slim shape of the tube as well, it fit easy in tiny pockets, clutches, and even workout arm bands. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Rhubarb is the best shade ever! I have light skin, light blonde hair and dark brown eyes. My undertone is neutral and the Rhubard looks great on me. It is one of my most favorite shades to wear on my lips! I love the color I get from the shimmer, not too over-bearing and just the right amount of coloring to be pretty and noticable. I also love how soft and silky it makes my lips and I can wear it over other lip colors as well to add a nice shimmer and change the tone of my color a bit. You can't go wrong with this one!"
"Love It!!! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this lip shimmer! I wear it everyday instead of lipstick. I was originally using the champagne, then I tried several other colors. Now I only wear the guava. If you are looking for that perfect shade of soft pink, guava is the way to go. It looks different than the color shown online. It is very similar to the champagne but slightly more pink. Not dark at all....the perfect amount of color! If you like the champange, you will probably like the guava even more!"
Lip Shimmer Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer is my favorite lip product. I love that it feels lighter than other lip colors and it makes my lips feel good. Please consider bringing back my favorite colors Nutmeg and Cocoa! I don't understand why those colors were discontinued when I had trouble ever even getting them in the stores because they were always sold out!!! I do like the Champagne color for everyday wear and that is what I now resort to purchasing so instead of 3 colors I buy one. So sad. . .
"Love this product I started using this product many years ago, I found it in a bird specialty store, believe it or not. The store doesn't always carry the color that I like and I was told that it was discontinued. But I found it easily online and have been reordering it every six months or so. I always have a fresh supply and I keep a lip shimmer in every car, coat, pocketbook so I am always prepared. I also keep a fresh one so I can share with someone and spread the word. what a great product!!!"
COCOA - PLEASE COME BACK TO ME! I thought I was the only one missing the beautiful color of lip shimmer that is Cocoa. I have also tried other colors but none of them look as fabulous as Cocoa does with my skin. I have even tried other companies lipstick but NONE of them compare or come close to looking as good as trusty Cocoa. Please allow us to buy the leftovers or tell us where we can get it. My lips have never looked as well as when I used Cocoa! Supply-Demand. It looks like a win/win situation here folks!!
"Fabulous product I've been using the Burt's Bees lip products for 11 years, since I went through chemo for cancer. My already dry lips became chapped. One of my oncology nurses recommended the Burt's Bees lip products and I tried them... and I've used them ever since. One of my daughters and her daughter also use these products (we each have our favorites). I've always liked Rhubarb and Nutmeg, but can no longer find Nutmeg. So I've tried Papaya... and now I can't find that color... HELP!"
WOW I have to say this is great lip wear! I used to get cold sores about once or twice a year but since I have been using this it is about once every two years and if I feel one coming on I use this and it almost stops it in its tracks. I know this is not what is supposed to be used for but my point is that it is obviously very healthy for the lips! It is great for daily wear but not overwhelming like lipstick. So if you want something that is healthy and natural looking this is it!!
"Great for sensitive skin Burt's Bees is my alternative to lipstick, Rhubarb is my favorite! They have the trendy colors I want, and other Vaseline, Burt's Bees is the only lip color I can use without causing an acne breakout around my lips because of my extremely sensitive skin. These have been a great solution though, I love them so much I always feel like I need to stockpile on them in case they ever get phased out!"
"OH MY GOSH --- TOFFEE is GONE I really really really really Loved the TOFFEE color. What happened This is abosolutely the Best color I have Ever had. And, I mean I have tried 100s of lipsticks. TOFFEE is the perfect color and texture and No one makes a color similar to this. It is stunning. Please please tell me that TOFFEE will return. I've stocked up some (8)...but my supply will be gone forever Seriously, hands down the prettiest color out there. Impossible color to find. Very very unique."
Love this product Makes my skin feel smooth all day love. Make up goes on great on top of it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Wish there were more of these! I had first read about this product in Cookie magazine I believe as a recommended first lipstick for young girls and I ended up trying it when it came to my area. This is a nice product for those who want the moisturizer and just a little colour that wears long. Unfortunately there are still only 3 colours offered in my area and they're kind of generic shades so I've been sticking to the no-shaded lipbalms for the time being until we get a few more options in stores.
"Great for young girls I bought the lip shimmer in Champagne for myself to only find out my older daughter was using it! I highly recommend this for young girls as it not only adds a natural looking color with a slight shimmer, but moisturizes well in the winter. I feel good about my daughter using this lip product since it is 100 natural does not contain any petroleum or harsh additives like so many lip balms do. Both of my daughter's love the fact that it has a minty taste!"
"Bring back Cocoa!! Please! The Lip Shimmer is one of your best products and I've tried almost every shade. None of them quite measure up to Cocoa, though. Please, please listen to your customers and bring this product back, even if it's only for a limited time. I know I would buy at least 5 + tubes and wouldn't doubt that the majority of people who have posted about Cocoa would as well. If this many people have taken the time to post about it, ti's for good reason! Please, Burt's Bees!"
"It's addicting! I've been wearing your Lip Shimmer for several years now. Rhubarb's my absolute favorite and garnered compliments from friends. Nutmeg, Papaya and Cocoa follow close behind. This is the best lipstick I've ever used, feels great - a bit tingly and creamy and the colors are wonderful. And, the skinny tube is a perfect size - slips easily into a pocket or evening bag. Don't change a thing, not the formula or the colors - I have to have it - I'm addicted!"
"Pure Gorgeousness I am so grateful for Burt's Bees! Out of the many products I am obsessed with from this brand, the Lip Shimmer in Nutmeg is one of the them! The little color swatch on the website is midleading- the shade is actually a beautiful coral. I am so glad I found this shade, please never discontinue it! It is perfect in every way- perfect tone, size, texture, ingredients, and VALUE. Thanks Burt's for allowing the switch to paraben-free cosmetics to be easy! We end up eating lip products inadvertently anyway, they should be natural!"
"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE !!! Please..... bring back the Toffee Lip Shimmer. I would personally be the first person to purchase the first CASE . Seriously. I used it forever and it became part of me. I have not been able to replace it thus far, despite trying five of your other colors. Finally started using Cocoa but was not fully satisfied.... and now you discontinued IT as well! Business strategy should be to meet the demand..... bringing back TOFFEE would definately result in more for you and more satisfied customers. PLEASE RECONSIDER!"
"HELP !!!!! I love the lip shimmer. My favorite color is Cocoa. I have looked everywhere. For over a year. Can't find it anywhere. I have bought 2 other colors, Raisin (2 - didn't realize that, that was the color that I had already purchased) and Plum. Don't like either one of them. Finally decided to check your website. What did I see....I am not the only one that was lookiing for it. Well, why don't you bring it back. That would be the sensible thing to do. P-L-E-A-S-E! You sure would sell alot of it. I am begging you. Please."
"dismayed I have used the lip shimmer Cocoa for several years now, after it was recommended to me by a co-worker. After I discovered Cocoa, I discarded Nutmeg and Watermelon and a couple others, and have never searched further. Now I find that Cocoa is unavailable! I looked through the new color line-up and do not see even a close substitute. Please bring back Cocoa. If not I will look for a new product line. I find it stupid and frustrating that Burt's Bees would mess with its products and customers, for reasons I cannot discern."
"The BEST!!! I first tried Burt's Bees lip shimmer a few years ago. I have never went back! You cannot believe the softness and long lasting color of the shimmers. Nothing feels quite like it and I always make sure there are several ( one for the car, one for my purse, one in my bedroom, one in the saddlebags on our bike, yes there is even one in my coat pocket) I am never without it! Thank you for such a great product you have a customer for life! And now I want to try many of the the other natural products for my grand children."
"Where's the Cocoa Lip Shimmer!! I came to the Burt's Bees sight looking to purchase the Cocoa Lip Shimmer because I have not been able to purchase it in stores. It's spot is empty or non-existent everywhere I go. To my horror, it appears that you don't carry it anymore! Is that really the case Everyone in my circle of friends is looking for it because we don't wear anything else! Every last one of us have tried the other colors and they do not work for us. Someone must read this and bring the Cocoa back! I'm starting a Cocoa Lip Shimmer campaign!"
"smells great makes my skin very soft........and smooth,and i have no blotches on my skin This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"better than my own two lips The lip gloss/lipstick that I refuse to be without! I am pale, and papaya is the color my lips should be, only better. There's one in each pocketbook, even in my briefcase, and of course, in my vanity drawer. No matter what color I wear, this is the lip shade I wear. It's perfect, and even when it feels as if it's worn off, the color lasts. My very critical mother even complimented it, and that's REALLY saying something. Fantastic for the office where the atmosphere is dry. Looks finished without being made up."
"Best Product Around! I have tried dozens of lip treatments, chap sticks,etc. to which every single one I was allergic to! My lips would swell up, peel or form a rash. This is the first and ONLY lip balm that has worked for me. The shade goes perfect with my skin and it feels so good when I apply it, like a nice tingly relieving feeling. I use it every day. I would recommend this product not only to those who are allergic to every lip product under the sun, but to anyone and everyone. You can't go wrong with these products!!! LOVE THEM!"
"Favorite lip color product I absolutely adore this product. My lips are very sensitive and dry, and Lip Shimmer keeps them hydrated and soothed every time I use it. In fact, it's the only color I use now. My favorite color is Peony, a clear, soft, honeyed rose with no blue (blue always makes my lips look purple). Unfortunately, Peony is not available on the website at this time. I'm hoping that's only because it's all sold out--not because they are fazing it out (heaven forfend!)."
"SO SAD TOFFEE IS GONE!!! I love my Burt's Bees Lip Shimmers. I can't wear any other lipsticks because they taste awful. BUT, I miss TOFFEE! I wear Cocoa and Toffee. I've tried some of the other shades, but they don't work for my skin tone. If I added Toffee to those other colors though, they worked. Now I'm left scraping the remnants of the tubes with lip brushes to get the last bit of Toffee out of the tubes. Once I'm completely out, those other colors will be thrown out. They just don't look good on me. : ( Please bring back Toffee!"
"Best Lip Shimmer I've tried other products that claim to have shimmer and also makes your lip moist, and most of them don't really last that long or taste terrible. Each Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer tastes the same Mint. I know some people say that mint actually dries up your lips, but not in this case. It smells good, it tastes good, and lasts a decent amount of time. The texture is a little greasy at first. The color wears off after the first hour, but NOT completely. Overall it's a great Lip Shimmer. I highly recommend it :)"
"Bring back the Cocoa Lip Shimmer I have been buying Cocoa Lip Shimmer for years, it is the only brown lipstick/ lipbalm that holds it color, doesn't bleed, and doesn't rub off on my teeth - there has been no other color like it - I had no idea it had been discontinued!! Please bring it back. I usually buy it 2 or 3 tubes at a time, and keep one in my purse and in various places around the house. I only have a partial tube left, and cannot find any other color like it in the Burt's Bees lines or in other brands. Why was it discontinued"
"My go-to lip stuff The Rhubard Lip Shimmer has been a staple in my purse and bathrooms for years. I love the softness, the tiny tingle of mint, and this shade is perfect for my coloring, which is white skin with dark blonde hair. The transparent color is so much more natural-looking than regular lipstick it adds to your own lip color rather than covers it. For those times that Rhubard is the wrong color, I opt for Watermelon or Raisin. I think I have about six tubes of each! Can't afford to run out, now can I This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Favorite Lip Color I have tried several shades of the lip shimmer and I have loved all of them. They work great at keeping my lips moisturized and pretty. The colors are great and generally natural looking hues. They have just the right amount of shimmer to look pretty and girly, but not annoyingly glittery. One thing men hate but girls love is gliter. This shimmer is a nice and happy medium, not like some overly glittery lip products from other companies. There is a nice cooling mint scent/flavor aswell. This product is a complete win. Love it!"
"The perfect Lip Colour I had been looking for a perfect lip color. Something that goes with my coloring and works with almost any color clothes. I found it in the Cocoa colored Lip Shimmer. THEN, Burts Bees chose to discontinue the color. I purchased everyone that I could find online and at stores in my neighborhood. I also wrote the company requesting the return of the color. I must not have been alone as the color is back. I also love how it conditions my lips and they look healthy when I wear it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"AMAZING! I can usually never find a really great lip color without it looking unnatural. I love natural looking glosses but can never find a good one that isnt sticky, or not a great color. This lip shimmer is great. It glides on perfectly, has a great balance of shine and color. Also I love the peppermint, I usually cant deal with peppermint anything, but it makes your lips feel great. I recommend this product if your not to big on makeup but wanna add a little color thats not overwhelming like lipstick."
"I love this product! I think this product really works, if you give it a lot of time to work. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Merlot color is the best! Please email me and tell me why this is being discontinued Burts Bees Merlot Lip Shimmer has been my only lip gloss since the first time I tried it many years ago. It is the PERFECT creamy texture, and I love the cocoa flavor, and the peppermint tingles my lips the perfect amount. The shop clerks tell me it is being discontinued, and I cannot find it anymore. The closet colors (Fig, Raisen), do not work for me. I therefore just ordered 50 Merlot Lip Shimmers online! I hope they last long enough for me to find a suitable replacement, but I'm not sure I will."
"Best Lip Shimmer Ever I Love Love Love my Cocoa Lip Shimmer. It is the very best lip color/moisturizer on the market that does not disappoint. It's super creamy, super absorbent, moisturizing and full on color and lip care. If you're one to not totally do lipstick but still prefer some color (natural color) that goes with everything and feels great and is great at the same time for your lips, you'll loooooove this shimmer. Thank you Thank you Thank you again BB's for bringing this beloved color back. There's nothing out there that compares. Cocoa Shimmer rocks!!!!!!! Yeahhh!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Put the Rasin lip shimmer back in stores I cannot find the Raisin shade of Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer in stores. I've tried several shades in this product line, and Raisin suits me best. I've recommended it to several friends and they love it, too. Please bring it back to stores for ease of purchase."
"Merlot I love this product! I don't like most lipsticks as I like them to be matte, but matte lipsticks tend to be pretty dry. This product is not only matte in many shades, but has moisturizing benefits and is very similar to a lip stain, for a great price! If you are looking for a true red, go for Merlot. I tried Rhubarb first because the store I was at did not carry Merlot, and although it looked pretty red, it was pinky. Merlot is wonderful, and it is a little glossy from the moisturizers, but if you blot your lips once or twice it looks simply amazing!!"
"I NEED COCOA LIP SHIMMER!!! I am currently in a state of panic! I need cocoa lip shimmer. It is the one thing I have to have with me at all times. I just lost one tube and my second tube just ran out. Cocoa lip shimmer is the only health beauty product that I cannot live without! I am completely devastated, to say the least! I searched all the usual spots where I buy it, and it is nowhere to be found. I had to settle for the caramel one, but I am still not happy. Cocoa is the only thing I have been putting on my lips for YEARS! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE BRING BACK COCOA!"
"Buy several because you will lose them! Love the Radiance! Best shimmery, smooth, minty and refreshing sheer glitter balm EVER!! I also had the Merlot, a little to purply for me, but it's great when I mix it with my lip glosses!! Best purchase for your money. I lose mine all the time cause the tube is super slender and lightweight... Buy several you WILL love them! Good for women of all ages because they offer so many great colors, and they are not to overpowering! Smell good and taste good too! Completely natural feeling, LOVE THEM! I wish I could try ALL the colors and shimmers!!!"
"BEST THING EVER IN THE WORLD this stuff is awesome. I can not wear any other kind of lipstick, this is it! however, MY color (coffee) seems to have disappeared! I am freaking out about this, because I bought a ton of them a few years back and now I am almost out!! Burt's Bees, if you're reading this, PLEAAASEE bring back the coffee color! If it didn't sell well its because it wasn't actually the color of coffee at all! (this is my only problem with these- all the color names are inaccurate!) OR if you still have any of them left I will buy them ALL from you- PLEAASE!"
"Lip Shimmer-Miracle for Lips I love Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer! Before I began using this product my lips peeled constantly and felt sore. I continually chewed on them trying to remove the rough, peeling layer. After trying many things, I found your medicated lip balm which began the healing process. Then I threw out all of my lipsticks and have used your Lip Shimmer (Rhubarb or Raisin) ever since! I love all of your products but your Lip Shimmer has been remarkable. I have not had anymore problems since I began using your products! I wish you made face makeup too!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Was the best when you had my color! Why, oh why, did you discontinue COCOA Lip Shimmer None of the other colors work for me......too pink, too red,too purple,too light,or too dark. COCOA matched my natural lip color, and complemented my complexion. I had not worn make-up lipstick in years. I kept it in my make-up tray and in my purse. Now, I have to look for another brand of something, and I hate it.....buy, try, discard, and then start all over, again. I am so disappointed, PLEASE, PLEASE, reconsider this decision!!! AND BRING IT BACK! Linda, a faithful user of COCOA."
Great product Just bought this in the Fig color. Looks very natural. I like the way it moisturizes and feels. The peppermint tingle is also refreshing. Would like to see a SPF for sun and wind protection but it will not keep me from using for now. Maybe BB's will consider a future product with everything the same and add SPF. Thanks for the products. After reading the reviews on the cuticle lemon butter I plan on buying some of that to try. Have had extremely dry cracked cuticles all my life. Have tried all types of cremes and lotions with no relief.
"wonderful cream Light weight, yet effective. I don't feel like I'm wearing a mask to bed. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Elated To See Cocoa Again! Thank you for bringing back the 'Cocoa' lip shimmer! Since it's discontinuation, I had been searching for 'that perfect shade', but, without any luck. Like so many other women, I was extremely happy to see it back on the shelves one day and immediately bought the last two tubes! This is the perfect neutral shade and works well day or night, all year round!! The best part about your lip shimmer is knowing that I'm using something that's safe and natural and free of chemicals!! I hope 'Cocoa' is here to stay for a very long time!!!"
"My Favorite!!! I LOVE the nutmeg color and use it compulsively. The peppermint flavor is great, and breath-freshening. I like this stuff because it is like a cross between lipstick and chapstick. I don't like using a lipstick in public, because it feels like I'm doing my makeup or primping in public, but this looks like a chapstick so I don't mind pulling it out at any time. I've used multiple colors of this but I absolutely adore the terra-cotta-looking nutmeg tint, it's the only one I'll use now. I'll have to try that papaya color though..."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! Ok, where to begin...these lip shimmers are so great! I love them b/c you get color with great moisture and no cracking or flaking like some lip colors. There are many different colors so you can find one for every occassion. I love the guava shimmer for summer days, and watermelon for evenings. Merlot is great in the winter when a darker color seems more appropriate. I can't say enough great things about these. There is no scent or taste which I like, b/c I've had some pretty strong smelling/tasting lip attire in the past."
"beauty w/health benefits I have been using Lip Shimmers for a few years now. My favorite color is Rhubarb-because it adds just the right amount of color-not too much, not too little. I also like this product because for me-it has an extra added health benefit. I have a tendency to get cold sores-and since using Lip Shimmers(which have all sorts of wonderful herbal ingredients) cold sores have rarely made an appearrance. It also doesn't taste or smell to bad like some lipsticks. The only thing i don't like about it-is that it doesn't last long enough!!"
"Best Lip Shimmer out there! I have always hated lipstick, but this feels just like the BB lip balm but with color! lIve tried Watermelon, Rhubard, and Merlot. Watermelon comes on pinkish. Rhubard blends in with my own lip color and gives it some color and mintiness. Merlot comes on very bright, but I get compliments almost every time I wear it. It also blends well with my lips, so it looks like my natural lip color! On my pale complexion, I'd say Rubarb looks best, but Merlot is not overpowering although bright. Doesn't look or feel lip-sticky at all!"
Best Lip Color I recently tried Caramel and Fig Lip Shimmer and it is the best lip color EVER for me! Warm colors work best for me and the caramel color looks great with my skin tone. Fig is nice for a berry type color. The Lip Shimmer moisturizes as well as they say and lasts pretty well for me despite the fact that it is more of a balm than a lipstick. LOVE this stuff!
Moisturizing I have a few tubes of the Lip Shimmer. I like the fact that when I put it on it stays on and I also like the fact that it's natural adds just a little bit of color and it continues to moisturizes your lips.
"I am obsessed Since purchasing the Watermelon color not long ago, I have bought almost every other color. The color pay off is so perfect and the fact that it's still a lip balm seals the deal! Radiance: Clear with a fine shimmer Champagne: Extremely light pink that will likely look clear/whitish on you but has more shimmer than Radiance. Guava: A very vivid light pink with A LOT of silver shimmer. The most shimmery color. Watermelon: A nice purple-ish pink with a fine shimmer. True to the cap color. Rhubarb: Reddish/magenta with no shimmer. Great vivid color.True to the cap color. Raisin: When you think of rich red, berry stained lips, this is that color. Sheer but obvious. No shimmer. The cap on this color is very deceiving, it's much much prettier and more vivid on your lips. Peony: Sheer pink with a fine golden shimmer. Caramel: Sheer peachy color with gold shimmer. Papaya: Very vivid burnt orange. Almost opaque. Cocoa: Medium brown with a fine shimmer. Very unique color, like hot chocolate."
"The best for everyday I recieved these in a pack of three for Christmas and I LOVE THEM. All the shades I got in my gift are all very nice but the shade I go for the most is rhubarb, I wear this color EVERY SINGLE DAY. These are all buildable colors, if I'm going somewhere nice I apply a bit more for bolder color than I would day to day. These also last a very long time, like I said I got these in Christmas and it's the middle of August and I'm nowhere near running out."
"Fantastic product! I previously had used a different brands similar product and can no longer find the product in stores, so I opted for this Lip Shimmer as it was the only product in stores that I was comfortable purchasing. I love it!!! I LOVE the peppermint in it and the color and shimmer is exactly what I was looking for! Thank you for creating such a fabulous product with 100 Natural ingredients!"
"Visible results Very happy with this product and would recommend it, does what it says This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"What A Concept! Who would think to combine Burt's Bees amazing lip balm formula with a gorgeous shimmery color Whoever did think of it I wanna thank them personally!!! I am obsessed with BB and I was never too into the idea of the shimmer until recently and I am in love. So far I own Rhubarb, Watermelon, Caramel, Peony, Radiance and Champagne. Rhubarb is not my favorite honestly, I have very fair skin and very light thin lips and it just makes me look like I'm wearing too much red lipstick. Watermelon is a very nice sheer pink which looks good with almost anything I wear! Caramel is a BEAUTIFUL peachy color with a very pretty fine shimmer. Peony looks the best on me, it's a lighter pink with barely any shimmer at all but that just accentuates my natural lip color. I adore Radiance because it's such a pretty clear with lots of shimmer and it looks great! Champagne looks a lot like Radiance except it's just a tad bit pinker which is pretty. I'd love to try Guava in the near future because it looks like such a pretty pink! Another amazing product! 5 Stars BB!!!"
"Lipstick vs. Shimmer Today I discovered Burts Bees sells actual lipstick and decided to buy some lipstick and some shimmer to compare. I bought Blush Basin for lipstick and Peony for shimmer (basically the same shade!) They both go on very smooth and cover well and leave your lips soft just like their chapstick, but the shimmer seemed to be a little more thick and therefore more moisturizing. The shimmer has that burning/tingling minty taste/feel whereas I didn't get that with the lipstick. The lipstick gives a satin, more professional look whereas the shimmer is, well, shimmery and reflects light more, making it more of a for-fun lip color. The lipstick seemed to stay on a little better - the shimmer is very smuge-able whereas the lipstick stays put better. Both are great!"
"A great thing in a small package There are some things worth having in multiples great shoes, great friends, and great lip gloss. Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer is certainly worth buying in two or three at a time. Start with a great price and availability in many stores, add to this a wonderful selection of colors that can be worn alone or mixed for an custom look, and then, ahhh - the look, the feel, the smell! Yummy! Your lips will love the treat of this all natural glaze of color. Your friends will ask - what lipstick do you use, it looks so natural and not painted on. You will feel and know the difference using a beauty product made by a company that always has been socially and environmentally responsible is, simply, a wonderful thing. And when, sadly, you get to the bottom of the tube - it is totally recyclable. But fret no, you bought multiples! Yes, good things come in multiples and Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer should always be one of them."
"STILL THE BEST AFTER ALL THESE YRS! I've been using Burt's Bees since the late 90's have used their lip shimmer for years now. I love it so that I like it better than department/drug store other more expensive natural lip shimmers. I love the long lasting power as it stays on practically all day long which is amazing. I like the subtle natural peppermint flavor how they plump my lips naturally. The variety of shades are amazing! Although I don't wear Cocoa, I was happy to see it back for the huge fan base it has b/c the shade's so rich elegant. I've been wearing 3 shades loyally for as long as Burt's came out w/ their lip shimmer line. I alternate daily between FIG RAISIN, MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITES WEAR RHUBARB WHEN I feel like wearing something brighter. Rhubarb's a great shade on pale skin also w/ a tan. RAISIN FIG look great too. Please don't ever get rid of RAISIN, FIG RHUBARB as their my daily go to shades can't find any other shades or shimmers that come close to these fabulous little gems! I also like how slender the tubes are which makes application so much easier! Thanks Burt's! :)"
"Highly Reccomended I have to say that ever since I first tried them, Burt's Bees lip shimmers have been at the top of my list of favorite lip products. I love that their size makes them easy to apply without getting them everywhere on my face. The small tip of the shimmer fits perfectly on my lips for easy application. Also, not only do they come in beautiful colors with the perfect amount of shimmer, they also are slightly minty and very hydrating, so you get the benefit of lip balm and color all in one! My personal favorite at the moment is the shade Peony. It's been my everyday go-to lip product for almost a year now and it compliments the color of my lips so well because it is a similiar shade. This makes it so that it is not too obnoxious and bold, yet still very pretty. I love that the shade can be worn formally or casually! I would highly reccomend this product!"
"beautiful tint and freshens breath It has just the right amount of color and beautiful shimmer for a glow rather than glitter mess. I was a bit apprehensive due to some horrific views, but newbies should ignore them and go and get some! I read stories of them drying out the lips or too much shimmer. Yes, there is noticeable shimmer but it only adds another dimension to the lippie. I got the lip trio of peony, fig, and champagne. Peony is like a pink bronzy or frosted color while fig is a no shimmer berry color. Champagne is a baby pink frost color but the shimmer is not overwhelming, believe me (I am African American and these colors still look flattering on me). So, if you are still a bit hesitant about the shimmer, try fig or plum which have no shimmer. By the way, the minty feel and smell is a bonus since it will freshen your breath while adding a smoothing feel to the lips."
love love this!! I love this!! smells very nice and color is super cute too.
"Best Lip Shimmer I have been using Champagne and Guava for the past 5 years and have always been highly satisfied. Thanks for making the best Lip Shimmer on the market. Just a hint of mint and a hint of shimmer. I work outside and with the public, my pocket always contains one of these. Thank you.Go, Bees!"
"Feels Great! I bought two shades of this great product, and I am greatly pleased! After a few days, my lips felt healthier and smoother even when I wasn't wearing the product. I have never tried a product from this company that I haven't liked. WTG Burt's Bees! Natural skin care and cosmetics that are actually AFFORDABLE! Who'd a thunk it P.S. Ladies, Cocoa is not coming back. When a company discontinues something, it's gone. The shade is available on many different shopping websites, so please go check. Colors of most cosmetic lines change with the seasons and fashions. Every one of us knows this, and, at one time or another has lost a favorite color or product."
Favorite lip shimmer My all time favorite lip product is the lip shimmer named Cocoa....can you imagine my dismay when i tried to buy a new one last week!!! After checking 3 stores i realized that i wasn't going to find any more of my all time favorite shade. So i actually came to the Burt's Bee website for the first time hoping against hope that i might be able to order my favorite shade but apparently that is not an option....i can't believe that you didn't have a shade even close to Cocoa!!!!! Please rethink this decision and bring back some of the all time best sellers----there's nothing else for me to buy!!!!! I'll be looking for the return of Cocoa..................
The product smells ok Olay don't work for me I have overly dry skin. I haven't found anything to work on my skin. So I'm hoping to be able to find something that will work. But I'm affrid I won't be able to find anything to help my skin not be so dry. It gets so bad the I dig at my legs all the time.
this product has an outstanding feature it is an amazing product it hydrates and regenerates my skin.richruby This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"totally in love! I'm sooo totally in love with this lip shimmer! I bought it at my local cracker barrel in plum just fell in love with it! I also wanna get it in guava, peony, raisin pretty much all of the colors. I have a pale, olive skin tone plum goes really well with it, if I wear very little makeup on my eyes, however, if I wear a lot of makeup on my eyes, I wouldn't be able to wear the plum cause that'd just be, like, too much, so I'd have to go with a light color, like guava or strawberry OR a rose-y shade (just a few tips). so, anyway, this is fantastic and you should mos def buy it! I'm stuffing my mum's stocking with the 3-pack gift set of pink shades - the one only bad thing about this lip shimmer is that you have to have a mirror to apply it, especially with a dark color cause, if you don't, you could accidentally mess up the application end up looking like a clown because you have to wipe off the outsides of your lips cause the lip shimmer is a lot softer than, let's say, the texture of a regular balm, so you could accidentally apply some right above or right below your lips it would be super noticeable you wouldn't even know it...also, because of this, you can't really rub your lips together, like with regular lip balms it does wear off somewhat quickly but not too quicky, so it's still pretty good quality."
"Can't Live Without I've been using Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer for years. My favorite way to use them is to combine Champagne and Toffee together. Great combo in my opinion. When my local stores stopped selling Toffee I was relieved to find it online. I sincerely hope they don't discontinue this color. Lip shimmer is just enough color, shine and moisturizer that it keeps my lips soft, smooth, and shimmery all day long. I just re-apply after lunch and dinner. Easy as that. Love the fresh, minty scent, too. (I also use the Beeswax Lip Balm with peppermint oil after brushing, before bed -- there's nothing waxy about it, and I wake up with totally soft lips - Love it!)"
"Need Our Cocoa!! I am begging with you to please bring back your Cocoa Lip Shimmer! I am allergic to all lip products other than Burt's Bees and Cocoa is really the only color that looks good on me! My lips tend to change the color of lip sticks and Cocoa always remained the same. As other reviewers have stated, Cocoa is never on the shelves and I have a few friends who only wear Cocoa, too. When we find it, we buy it for each other! Please bring this color back...I bought the Plum...no turns to pink. I bought Cherry...no way....I bought Watermelon...uh, no again. So, I guess I will not be buying Burt's Bees. And, I WANT TO! Help me purchase your product!"
"Fig and Watermelon ROCK!! I love fig and watermelon shades. Fig lasts super long on my lips and it gives it a good color. It looks like red lipstick, except i don't have to worry about it getting on my teeth! Watermelon is lighter and gives my lips a more natural look to them, but keeps them in good shape:) Overall, I would reccomend the fig and watermelon shades, but the product is super mouisturizing. It acts like a regular Burt's Bees peppermint chapstick, except the fact that it comes in a variety of radiant colors:) it also has that same pepperminty tingle that the chapstick does when you use it, and is just like one. BUY IT!!"
"Best lipgloss/chapstick duo I received a little gift pack of these lip-glosses from my mom for college. I can honestly say that they are in the top three of my most used make-up items. The colors are great and the moisture lasts a while. I am blond so the Rhubarb was a little dark for me, but it still would look good if I were going for a dramatic effect. Way better than lipstick or lipgloss in my opinion. The champagne is definitely the best color out of them (for me, anyway). It's wonderfully shimmery. Watermelon is just a good all-around color. These are awesome to receive as gifts. Friends definitely won't be disappointed."
"Love Lip Shimmers, BUT.... I have always loved lip shimmers, but as a dark blonde with green eyes and golden skin, pinks look AWFUL on me, so my colors were nutmeg and papaya...and now I see they're GONE!! I love lip shimmers because they're so smooth, shiny and non-sticky...all competitors brands are too drying and don't have the wonderful minty freshness that Lip Shimmers do...I'm not sure what I will do when my nutmeg and papaya are empty. Please consider bringing these colors back to keep customers whose skin tones are not conducive to all the pinks/purples you've added in the places of our beautiful oranges.... :-("
"i miss a product I have used burts bees lip shimmer in shade Cocoa for a very long time. I used to buy every tube left on the shelf in fear that I would not be able to find it. Well, it has happened. I have been searching every store that carries burts bees products, no shade compares to Cocoa. (I have tried several other shades and they all look too pinkish on me). I have even tried other brands hoping at least for the right shade but other brands do not have soothing power. I was hoping to just order it here, but I see it does not exist anymore. Please bring back the shimmer in Cocoa for the health of my lips."
"Great Stuff! The color is nice, a little sheer if you put it on gently but full color if you apply heavily. It covers two different types of lipstick depending on how you apply it, and that's a great saving! I love the texture and richness of color! It does not dry your lips like lipstick does, and it wears off gently so you don't look like your second grade school teacher after a couple of lessons. Raisin is my favorite color. I have dark hair and eyes and lips and this is just the right shade for brunettes.

Where is the RAISIN lip shimmer !! This is my favorite lip color with a nice amount of red in it to look like lipstick but without all the artificial crayon feel. I've been to many stores and they have other colors but not the Raisin.ACK! Please make more and restock the shelves. And don't change the color! I'll buy in bulk if I have to.. Disappointed long time customer
"Please bring back cocoa I got my first cocoa lip shimmer in my stocking several Christmases ago and have been hooked on it ever since. I've tried other colors, but cocoa is by far my favorite. I love the long-lasting color, how it moisturizes my lips and the shade just compliments my skin tone so well. I ask for it every year for Christmas and was so disappointed to hear that it was no longer being carried. It has been my go-to lip color for so long it's going to be hard to find a replacement. Hopefully, you'll reconsider because it looks like I am not alone in this request. Please bring back cocoa!"
"great product Lives up to its promise, great product. Oil of Olay is worth the money. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"What happened to cocoa DITTO!!!! All the other reviews before me. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE bring back cocoa lip shade!!! It was the PERFECT shade for me and I have spent to much money on other shades that I thought would be comparable. No luck:(If/when you do bring back cocoa, please don't change anything about the original cocoa product) Again, I beg you to please bring this back! It's AMAZING, I know you would have countless renewed and satisfied customers if you did. I don't mean to be so demanding, but I want what's best for all of us. COCOA! COCOA! COCOA! ( Thank you for your time!"
"Very Smooth I have two of these lip shimmers and I love them so much! My first one was Champagne, and it is quite shimmery. I assumed that all of the balms in this line are just as shimmery, yet was delightfully surprised to learn that it's not so. Cherry does not have large shimmer particles, which is very nice. These shimmers always apply to smoothly and I am amazed by how long they last. Hours, and the color is still uniform. Never dry out and set in the lips, like my lipstick does. I like these even more than that natural 4x more expensive lipstick. Great color selection!"
"These are great I have two of these and feel like they are just the right amount of shimmer and color for those of us who don't necessarily like glossy lips but still want some shine. The watermelon color is a purple-pink, and I wasn't sure at first, thought it was a little dark (I have fair skin) but now I really have come to love it. I also have the grapefruit shade, which looks slightly like a nude lip on me, which I LOVE. This shade would probably be way too light for those with darker skin tones as it is a bit light even for myself. I love these and will buy them forever!"
"Perfect everyday lipwear! I started using the Champagne Lip Shimmer two years ago, and have loved it ever since! It gives my lips the nice light color I like without having to wear lipstick, and it is also just like a lip balm so it moisturizes and keeps my lips soft too! I use it everyday, especially at work when I want to look nice and keep my lips from getting dry at the same time. I sometimes use it in conjunction with lipstick, as a kind of gloss, but usually I wear it alone. I always have an extra stick on hand so that I don't run out, because I couldn't go a day without this product!"
"Discontinuing Cocoa shimmer I finally stopped trying to establish a satisfactory justification for the discontinuing of Cocoa from the Shimmer color selections. I don't believe there is one. Cocoa is/was the only true brown in the Shimmer collection. By true brown, I refer to a true chocolate tone, containing no reds, pinks, or blues, altering the tone to something other than a true brown. As I mentioned, I see no justification whatsoever why, especially a company with the status and name such as yours, would do away with such a color that is so very difficult to locate at any level, whether it be from the local pharmacy, to the high end department store cosmetic counters. True browns are VERY difficult to find. PLEASE bring it back. On my last purchase, I bought every tube the store had, which was 12. I did not know at this time the color had even been discontinued. I've used my last tube. I beg of you to PLEASE bring Cocoa back. Finally, this was the ONLY, yes ONLY product I have ever used that did not end up on my teeth. I'm 48, and have used products ranging from 2-40, all of which I would need to check periodically for teeth coverage. I never had to worry at all with Shimmer Cocoa."
"Wedding Worthy I really love these lip shimmers! For my wedding I wore Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer in Peony, a beautiful peachy pink color (I specifically bought it for my wedding). I also own Nutmeg which is a bit of a coral pink color. I did my own make up for my wedding and this product was perfect! It gave just enough color and shimmer on my lips to give me a naturally beautiful wedding look and kept my lips moisturized (plus I love the tingly mint feeling). I highly recommend these lip shimmers. The colors are great and can be sheer or full depending on application, they don't dry out lips, they feel light, don't rub off too easily, they smell great and seem to last for a while, all for a good price. And if you're bride doing your own make up and want something light and natural, they're worth trying."
"Just Enough Color I really like this product. I purchased the peony color, and though it is very similar to my natural lip color, it provides just a bit of shimmer without being too much. I also like that the product is pretty long lasting in terms of wear. Would recommend!"
"Fantastic pigmented lip protection!! I have the Merlot Rhubarb lip shimmers from Burt's Bees. I think I'm addicted to them, they are soooooooo good!!! I have a very pale, yellowish-ivory complextion, my eyes are honey-brown. My natural hair color used to be very dark brown (sometimes it looked black) it would sometimes get a reddish tint if I went in the sun. Now my hair is almost all silver and the back is salt-n-pepper. The Merlot looks just like wine is dramatic looks really good when I want to dress up. The Rhubarb is a soft kind of rosey-pink that looks really natural for everyday wear. They protect, moisturize you can feel the tingle of healing all the time adding color. I also have Burt's Bees Lifguard's Choice Waterproof Sun/Snow lip balm. That one leaves your lips white-ish like the 1960's lipsticks that were popular when I was a teenager. I have been living in NC for 6 yrs. and only wished I started to use them sooner than that. Their products are natural, help the enviornment, they are in my same transplanted state, help the economy work. Hey Burt's Bees please make them in a traditional lipstick packaging!!!!!! Love your products!!!!!! NC, EVERYWHERE, buy from this company!!!!! They are great!!!!!!!!"
"My Favorite Lip Product Ever I recently just bought this, without reading reviews and everything. I have used the normal Chapstick brand for years but I really wanted lip gloss or a lip stick at the same time because I feel like my lip color is too boring. I was always interested in this because of all the colors in the store and that Burt's Bees was natural. I bought this in Cherry. The first time I wore this, my friend was just in love with the color on me and I was so happy. That was the first time I wore it in public. It provides enough color that is satisfying and the moisture and hydration is WONDERFUL. There is some color transfer but of course I reapply it after I eat and after 2-3 hours, but you can feel the moisture. I love it so much. I'm hoping to get Plum, Fig, and Champagne soon."
"Another member of the Cocoa fan club here... I came to the website to email Burt's Bees about Cocoa...to ask whether there was any chance it might be brought back and also to find out what shade might be close. I've wasted money on two other colors, trying to find something else I like, with no success. I thought I must have been part of a small minority of people who really loved this shade. But now after seeing all the reviews, I see that I AM NOT ALONE!!! When it was discontinued, I purchased a few tubes from somebody on eBay. Now the eBay sharks are charging CRAZY amounts of for it - not that I can blame them. It's the law of supply of demand. Why doesn't Burt's Bees want our business Clearly there were A LOT of us buying this shade. Please, please hear our pleas and bring back Cocoa."
drenched this product makes my face feel like I have de-aged by twenty years! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Bring Back Cocoa Lip Shimmer I am very upset that you have discontinued the Cocoa shade lip shimmer. I love that color and it's the only lip color I use. I loved it so much that I stopped buying lipstick and lipgloss. I see by the reviews that I am not the only person who misses this color. The others don't work for me and I have already wasted enough money trying some of the others out. Please reconsider putitng back on the market. Please!!!!!! I also have friends who use it who are also upset that we can't find it. I have also spend a lot of gas going around to different stores trying to find it...before I knew it was not being made anymore. It appears that the color sold as well as any other and you don't have another similiar. Please!!!! Thank you, Elizabeth"
"Favorite Lip Product I love this stuff! I have the plum shade and honestly it's one of the best lip products I have ever used. It has a lip balm kinda of texture, but it's very dry, but in a good way. The color is very vibrant and beautiful and lasts for hours. It goes on matte, so if you'd like a more glossier look I'd say put this lip shimmer on and then some lip gloss to make it shine, but I love it matte. Not only does it looks good, it feels good. It definitely moisturizes your lips with a hint of mint. The slight tingle from the mint reminds me of the mentha lip shine from C.O. Bigelow. It has everything I've ever wanted in a lip product all rolled up into one. I definitely recommend this lip shimmer for all lovers of both lipstick and lip balm. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"AMAZING! I read a lot of reviews of women complaining that they will discontinue using Burt's Bees because Cocoa has been discontinued...and to discontinue using this product just because Cocoa was discontinued is blasphemous. These lip shimmers are amazing. The product itself is very moisturizing and gives a nice slight tingle. I have purchased every single color of the lip shimmers and am happy to say that I do use them all haha. The color selection is great there's a color for each occasion. Caramel, Peony, and Radiance are great for really casual days or a natural look. Rhubarb provides a nice red lip, an increasingly popular trend. I truly can't say enough good things about not only this product, but the entire Burt's Bees line."
"Go To Lipcare Keep a couple of these available these days, the tough winter in Florida can be very drying, you know My go to colours are raisin, cocoa and watermelon, for now... Nice taste but not meant to be eaten, want to let them do their thing on the lips. Light with just enough colour, subtle and effective. Think I may need to consider regular delivery..."
"Best Purchase Ever For years I could never find the right lipstick shade for my skin tone. A friend recommended me the lip shimmer from Burt Bes's. I tried the Nutmeg and I did like it . The shade leaves a soft peachy look on my lips. However, I did like the shade but I was looking for a more pinkish natural shade for my lips. I went to the local store and bought Cocoa, Champagne, and Peony. Cocoa was too dark for my lips..almost like a plum color. Champagne was whitish on my lips and totally washed out my face. Peony is my favorite!!!!This color leaves a soft pink color on your lips! Great for any occasion! I went out to buy 2 more tubes of it! I am looking forward to try the Fig, Rhubard, and Merlot ."
"Time for Raisin It's Fall and time to bring back Raisin. Raisin, Cherry and Fig are my go to colors in the Fall. The shimmers are great. I can keep my lips healthy and have color too. I can't wear normal lipsticks so the lip shimmers have been a life saver. I get asked all the time where do I get my lipstick. They are shocked to learn it's Burt'sBees. Can you add a sun block to them That would make it 100 perfect. Thanks, Burt's Bees"
"A new favorite! I have blonde hair and fair skin, which is important to mention because each shade will look different on everyone. The first shade I ever bought was raisin. It's nice, but way too dark for me. And the champagne color was so light that it washed me out. But all the middle shades are fabulous. My favorite is the new peony! It's close to my natural lip color but kicks it up a notch. A neutral color that goes great with everything. Best of all, the lip shimmer moisturizes just like their lip balms. And they smell amazing! A hint of refreshing peppermint that's not overpowering. Bottomline: Once you find the right shade for you, you'll never go back to any other un-natural brand!"
Unhappy customer Very very very unhappy that you do not have lip shimmer in cocoa anymore. How disappointing to not be able to find this color. I have used this color for a very long time and can't believe you got rid of it. All the new colors do not match my skin tone and I do not like any of them. The color cocoa was perfect for me. Please please bring it back and I will buy 10 at a time just so I will have that color. Companies do this all the time and I don't understand why they do this when the product is selling well. I am one very unhappy Burt's Bees customer.This is the only product I bought from your line so I guess I am done with your lip shimmer. So very sad! Debbie

Have used this product before and would buy again. I use this lotion daily. It is difficult to buy at stores so was happy to be able to find it on line and at a much better price. Will use this provider in the future.

"Too sticky I asked for one of the small tubs of Vaseline for Christmas because I absolutely love the Vaseline brand, and this was super sticky! I was so disappointed, but I tried the small tubs of Vaseline (original and rosy lips), and those were just fine. Weird!"

"Good but too sticky! It is a good product however it is way to sticky. Everytime I close my mouth and open it, my lips get stuck! I also hate having to dip my fingers into the tub everytime and then clean my fingers. Make a Coaco butter squeeze tube that is not sooo sticky!!!!"

Sticky Love the smell and i love vaseline for chapped lips but this lip therapy is a bit too sticky for my taste.
"It's Not Da-Balm I tried the Vaseline's Cocoa Butter petroleum jelly and like the coconut-y scent so much that I decided to get this balm but I find this doesn't smell as nice as the petroleum jelly as it smells a bit more fake - a tad less coconut-y coconut with something else, like pina colada. I have been using their Original unscented balm and I like that more. Somehow I find this Cocoa Butter one feels slightly more thin and a smidgen less moisturising than Original. I most likely wouldn't buy this one again but I'd get Original again."
Wao It iz cool ok so das why I buy it cos I like lips to kiss
"Nuvo Vaseline The cocoa butter flavor is quite pleasant and a change from usual lip balm flavors. Comes in a cute container also. It's messy to put on and doesn't seem to last long, but it's good while it lasts. I would give it 3-4 stars but it's not possible to give my own star rating. Not sure why."
"In love with it I love this product. I am in love with the smell of cocoa butter. I put it on at least every 40 mins but other than that, I love this product."
"Love, love, love I love this product but I wish it would come in a tube!"
"I like it! The product was great, my lips are so soft. But the only thing that bothere me was the application process. I have long nails so when I went to put some of the balm on, there would be some of the product stuck in my nails. It was gross. Other than that, I love my new soft lips!"
"love this stuff i love this product helps my lips to stay moist and not get cracked, if i feel my lips are getting dry i slap this on and they moisten right up. But please please put this in a tube so we dont have to stick our fingers in it and spread around germs.."

"Great but needs tube style Love the smell, and that's hard for me to find!I have allergies, but this has a nice small ingredient list! Nice moisturizing like the original, but even better. Needs to come in a tube! I'm in the Healthcare field with clients, can't keep sticking finger in a jar... ick! Please make available in a tube!"
"Great product The product in itself is fantastic!! It's the packaging I would take issue with. If you have nails at all, carry qtips or a small make up applicator! Otherwise I strongly recommend it!!"
Amazing Results It moisturizes my lips extremely well and I use this on a daily basis. My lips are usually chap so this product helps me out a lot. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is very thick but that property also allows the product to last for a longer period of time.
"Cute little lip therapy I like this product. It does keep my lips moisturized. I do wish I'd gotten the one that would lightly tint the lips, but maybe next time."
Love It This product is so convenient and feels great on my lips Keeps them looking good too
"Make a squeeze tube!! Please, please, please make a squeeze tube! This is a fantastic product. It brought my extremely dry, flaky, painful lips back to life after moving to a dry, cold climate that was an extreme shock to my skin. I now use it before exercising in the winter air, before showering, etc., to prevent dry lips to begin with. It's genuinely the best product I've ever used to moisturize or protect my lips. But I can't give it 5 out of 5 because I really dislike having to dip my fingers into the jar so very much - and a makeup brush is annoying in the house and entirely impractical outside of the house."

Amazing product I needed something to keep my lips from getting dry. I use it everynight when I go to sleep and I wake up with great results!
Very Soothing! The Vaseline starts working instantly! your lips start to fill so plump and smooth! it also stays on longer!
WORTH EVERY PENNY I will definitely be buying more I love the cocoa butter Vaseline because it smells awesome
LOVE! this is the best product i have ever used for my dry lips and i have tried everything.
This is my life Every time I use this it's as if I'm putting liquid gold on my lips. Worth every penny.

Great Product Love this product. Please do not let this be a trial or be discontinued.

great stuff. its t best stuff to use for lips. My doc recommends it.
"New purchase, new LOVE It actually lasts on the lips. After using the EOS lip balms that look cute but dried my lips out, the Vaseline Cocoa Butter lip therapy has fixed my lips and made them feel soft again. The smell is amazing as well and I cannot wait to try the rosy tinted one )"
Absolutely Perfect Product! This product is perfect. It makes your lips as soft as ever and tastes/smells amazing. I definitely reccmend this product to everyone consoiding buying it. The only downside I hhis prothat duct is thithat if you put too mt become caked and gross.s pro
"Love it! I am sensitive to many products...not this! Actually used this to recover from a reaction I had to another product. Worked very well...and quickly! By far my favorite for dry, irritated lips. Love that it's colorless and smells great too!"
Amazing product This product is amazing. I've always wanted a lip product that give my lips a sort of glow and keeps it moisturized. This Vaseline lip therapy does this and even adds a gloss that isn't too overbearing! Absolutely love this product.
Best lip product ever This product is amazing. Sinks in and hydrates your lips all day and night. I put this on before bed and when I wake up in the morning my lips still feel super soft and hydrated. I love it!
Obsessed I love this! I have very bad chapped lips all year round and this helped better than stuff from my dermatologist! Please please please make the cocoa butter lip therapy in a squeezable or stick.
Look and feel like stars and silk! This product gives my face a starry appearance and a silky feel. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Cocoa Butter Lip Therapy This is one of the best products I ever bought. I know that any time my lips feel dry I can put this on and my lips feel better. They are smooth and moisturized because of this product. I love the barrier the Vaseline creates.
Magic to my Lips!!!! I love vaseline cocoa butter. My lips are always dry so I wanted something to make them softer.This is a great product it also smells so good!! I love this product it made my lips so soft!! It's like magic to my lips!!!
I've never found a better product It is the only balm that stays on my lips through the night. When I wake up after applying the night before my lips feel amazing! I don't have to reapply nearly as much as any other moisturizing lip product.
"LOVE IT This is the best lip balm, it keeps my lips soft and I love the cocoa butter added! I was on the fence with the original but I feel like I don't know what I would do without the cocoa butter balm! Great Choice!"
"Wonderful product Since I was an infant, my mummy used vaseline on me.At 33 years am still using it and I have never used any other jelly on my skin.The new Cocoa Butter flavored is the best.Keep up the good work."
"HEALTHY LIPS INSTANTLY! This product has been the best therapy for my dry lips ever! Very easy to apply, and pretty much instant results. My lips are smooth and healthy. Ohh, and the product packaging is so cute as well :-)"
"AWESOME SAUCE It is perfect for everything! Feet (especially in this weather), elbows, lips, knees, and whatever else! I would like for as much people as possible to indulge in this amazing product!"
Love! Love! Love! Literally bought this and used and then went back and bought the rest I the stock Walmart had to put in every room of my house! Perfect moisturizarion and makes my lips soft as silk!
Love it :) It makes my lips feel so good and I love the sents.
Love this I love this lip balm it softens my lips I also had it in rosey lips and original I only wish there was a coconut flavour!! but it is stil is very good!!!
"Awesome smoothness Love the way this goes on smoothly, not too thick, just right! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Really Works! I had no idea that Vaseline had a product just for lips. So my lips were cracked on both sides, so I tried it and 2 days later... My Lips We're Healed!!!"
The best This stuff is amazing! It works great and it isn't greasy but it soaks right into your lips and make the look and feel great This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Amazing product! This product is amazing! I recently received it as a stocking stuffer, and I've been using it everyday. It makes your lips so smooth and moisturized. My lips get extremely chapped no matter the season, and this has been getting rid of any cracking on my lips. It also moisturizes your lips for a long period of time, and stays on your lips. I like to use this at night especially, because it can really sink into the lips. Highly recommend!"
"THE ABSOLUTE BEST but need better container I love this product and find that nothing heals my chapped lips better! The cocoa butter really soothes and repairs my skin while the petroleum jelly seals in the moisture. However, I need to be able to apply this in a more sanitary manner. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put this same product in the squeeze tube, and I'll buy more!"
"Love love love this product! I recently been suffering from extremely dry lips. I tried everything from eos, burts bees, baby lips etc... thought I wasn't going to find anything that would soothe my dry lips. I decided to try vaseline cocoa butter lips therapy. As soon as I applied it instantly made my lips smoother and softer. I absolutely love this product and recommend to anyone who suffers from dry chapped lips. Thank you for making this product!"
"This stuff is amazing My lips have always had problems with getting chapped and dry, even with regular Chapstick. I got the little lip therapy one that has a hint of Rose. It's amazing! I rubbed my lips together this morning and they are so soft. They haven't been like this in years. And I love that it adds a slight pink tint when it's on my lips and it even leaves the tint after its off! I'm so in love with this product."
"It Works! This is the best product!!!! Trust me when I say this. I've tried every lip balm/Chapstick there is, you name it I've tried it. My lips get dry and chapped very easily and this seems like the only thing that has helped it. It keeps my lips protected and moisturized for a long period of time. I don't have to constantly apply it. The only thing con is... I wish it came in a tube. Other than that, I would recommend this!"
"Favourite Balm This is the best lip balm that I have ever used. Lasts forever on my lips, and smells heavenly. Not too thick, a tad sticky but I'll deal with it! Makes my lips super soft, unlike most balms which just dry my lips out. And the tub is lasting me forever. Going on the third month, and its not even half empty! Love it for my winter lips."
"Amazed! My lips were super dry this morning and I applied this product ONCE over 12 hours ago. My lips are so smooth and soft, I'm actually amazed. I never write product reviews but cannot rave enough about how amazing this is. It is my new go-to for soft lips. I'm still in shock!"
LOVE LOVE LOVE i used my daughters and feel in love so of course I had to get my own. I've been hooked since the first application!!!
It didn't feel natural on my skin. I used it for several days in a row and I felt like I was wearing a mask. And my skin felt unnatural and dry under it. My skin felt coated instead of hydrated. I will not purchased this product again.
Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream This is a great product. It smooth going on and not messy. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Love I love this product I put in on every night before I go to bed and wake up with my lips feeling so soft it lasts so long I have mine for about two months and it's only gone down a little . I personally like the texture of the original better as this one is a little more thick but I read that lots of people like it and it's not that big of a deal
"Chapped No Longer Love this one definitely the Best one I've ever used. Weather's getting cold. nothing else helped but this. when you apply it on your lips, there is this soothing feel. and in minutes my chapped, peeling lips healed like magic. I even use it on my eyelash since I do my makeup on a daily basis. Need I say more"
"Just pure amazinggg!!! i've tried so many lip balms (Baby lips, EOS and etc) and lets just say this one is by far the best thing ever!!! i usually apply this at night but i should start bringing this around because nothing softens my lips besides thiss!!"
It works - simple as that. I have eczema of the face and incredibly dry skin to boot. This stuff is worth the extra cost over basic Vaseline as it wears thicker and coats the skin and lips. It has helped ease the eczema flares and provides the long lasting moisture my skin apparently craves. It doesn't agitate anything either. I love this and swear by it.
Kissably soft This product leaves your lips Kissably soft. It's not sticky at all.
"Fantastic! Have tried numerous types of ChapStick's and my lips always so chapped during winter. Tried this and instantly felt the difference. Feels great, smells nice, and keeping my lips smooth and glossy for hours at a time."
I really love this stuff! I am a total lip balm fanatic but this has replaced every one of the many lip balms in my purse. My dry cracked lips are instantly smoothed and stay that way for a long time. I love it so much and am going to try the rose tinted one next.
"Amazingly protective I have chronic angular cheilitis, which basically means my lips tear like they're made of tissue paper. My doctor told me to try Vaseline, and I saw this at the store. It smells great, stays on really well, and is literally the only thing to help my lip tearing. Thank goodness for this product! The only thing that could make it better is SPF, because I'm afraid the glossiness in the summer. Also, the packaging is really cute but it's hard to get the product out of the container when it starts to get near the bottom. I have long nails, so it's okay, but if a man with larger fingers and short nails was trying to, it might be extra difficult. Might think about a squeeze tube or something."
"AMAZING I have been a Burt's Bees user for almost a decade now. With the cold weather this season, my lips have been incredibly dry despite the regular application of Burt's Bees. I remembered that someone had given me the cocoa butter Vaseline lip therapy to try so when I got home that night, I decided to apply it. I cannot tell you how incredibly wonderful this product is. I never thought I would say this, but I will never go back to Burt's Bees. My lips have NEVER felt so moisturized. On top of it all, I don't have to apply it nearly as often as I would with the Burt's Bees. I cannot say it enough- this product is wonderful and I am so glad I gave it a try."
"10-Oct I have used a lot of lip care products. I have literally samples so many I feel like a conosure. The best I have found is Dr. Dan's Corti Blam it heals SEVERLY chapped lips in 2 day (based off personal experience). Any way I was once on Accutane and I know what dry lips are all about trust me, but I wish I would have know about this sooner. This is about the closes you can get to Dr. Dan's Corti Balm in my opinion, and it's much cheaper. If you need to just keep your lips moist and I chapped I would definitely get this, but if you have a major problem get the Dr. Dan's. All and all this is a fantastic product."
this product true regenerates my skin I can tell a difference when I haven't applied the cream. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"My new favorite! I have angry skin in general, I'll spare you the list, but this year has been especially bad. I have been trying different things but (a) I'm really picky, (b) when my lips are chapped I want totally clear so it doesn't stick to teeth, and (c) I hate most flavors as they make me feel nauseated, so I've not found anything that I fell in love with. On top of that, some actually caused an itchy rash *around* my lips! I also wanted to grab some regular Vaseline for a rash my doctor recommended it for, and I thought it may help my lips...I actually think the container is super cute and just use the back of my nail to get it out, and rub any excess on my hands. Immediately I fell in love with the very light scent and shine, and keep expecting to need more only to find it is still on after meals, drinking throughout the day, talking, etc. Also since its clear I can put around the edges of my lips and the side creases where mine crack without looking like a clown. It feels...absolutely luxurious. I also can put my regular lipstick on with Vaseline Lip Therapy over it for protection and shine. I've been reading about other uses for regular Vaseline and am so hopeful for other skin irritations they haventvreally been able to fix, that at least I can get some relief! So yes, I am thrilled with my cute little jar and plan to stock up - definitely recommend to anyone for year-round use!"
Love it! It's smooth an keeps my lips moisturized longer than regular chap stick or lip gloss
"PERFECT for Those of Us with Skin Issues Where do I begin! I have eczema chronically, so my skin can be very sensitive. Recently, I saw my dermatologist because my face was AWFUL (breaking out, itchy, cracking, etc)... turns out, I had angular cheilitis, oral thrush, AND perioral dermatitis. What the heck! My doctor told me that most lip products further irritate the condition because of all the additives, so he recommended Vaseline. I tried the regular Vaseline, but it was too runny for me... but the Cocoa Butter Vaseline... WOW!! It applies thicker than the regular variety and soothes my irritated lips."
"LOVE IT I bought this two days ago to help my chapped lips after having a bad cold/sinus infection. I blew my nose so many times my upper lip and my nose was cracked and red, and pretty painful. This instantly soothed my lips, and it's kinda funny, but I put it on the tip of my nose and upper lip too, and now my nose is almost completely healed! I tried everything to soothe my poor nose before, and the alcohol content of other creams burn! After two days it's a 360 transformation! This stuff is the bomb!"
"Absolutely Love IT!! I absolutely love the cocoa butter lip therapy. I am a lip gloss lady, therefore, I first apply the vaseline then apply my gloss right on top. It keeps my lips from drying out and it provides excellent long-lasting results! Its actually better than the regular kind. The smooth texture of the vaseline is just right - not too thick not too sticky....I have purchased the .25 oz size jar 3x's already since the beginning of the year! I keep it handy in my make-up bag and it travels w/me wherever I go! It's now a must-must product for me to have!"
"best chapstick I've ever used! Believe my I've used many kinds of chap stick, and unlike most other chap stick brands, Vaseline soothes your lips and deeply penetrates them. Most chap stick moisturizes the surface of your lips then dries out the rest of the lip, including the surface! One of my favorite things about it is that it last's so much longer than any other leading brand's when your drinking anything, in the shower, or even swimming Vaseline stay's tight to your lip's. That's why I love Vaseline's lip therepy. They even have it colored pink for dressy occasions. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Worth Every Cent This product is the best moisturizer for my lips that I have ever bought! I use this nightly, and it has made my lips softer, more supple, and definitely more kissable. I have tried using products like Nivea, Baby Lips, Carmex, Eos (basically anything I could get my hands on) and nothing compares. This is a must have! Also, for people who sorry about getting to the bottom of the contain, I use a makeup brush as an applicator. Lip brushes are a dollar or two at Target and you can just rinse through when you're done."
"Made my lips so soft! It was smaller than I was expecting,but it made my lips so soft!"
"Life Saver! I take Accutane, an acne medication that drys your skin out. My lips are effected the most and I constantly put Chapstick on. I saw the Vaseline lip therapy at the store and decided to try it. I will never use another Chapstick again! This product is amazing! It feels nice going on, smells and tastes so good and locks in moisture leaving my lips feeling better than ever. Highly recommend this product to anyone with dry lips."
"Please make this in the tube!!!! Carrying this around and dipping my finger into it does not work well in my profession as a Registered Nurse. I work in the operating room and the masks dry out my lips. Vaseline is the only thing that works. I loved the Cherry in the tube (which I WISH you'd bring back!!!!)...but my favorite Vaseline flavor is the cocoa butter. Please, please, please make this in the tube!! This nurse would thank you over and over!!"

"LIP THERAPY TIN IS AWESOME I've been using the Vaseline Cocoa Butter Lip Therapy Tin that I received in my free Influenster December VoxBox for the past couple of days and I'm in love. My lips have been extremely chapped from our horrible weather lately and product that I had been using didn't provide any relief at all. As soon as I received the box in the mail I put it on right away and I've been reapplying ever since. I'm on day 3 now and my chapped lips are now soft, smooth and very kissable (at least that's what the hubby says). This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Thank You I loved the product. Has maintained my lips hydrated during my trip to the United States and has made itself felt smooth, shiny and moisturized. I recommend this product to any person."
wonderful Love this product. Its amazing. Made my lips super soft and silky smooth.
The best Best lip moisturizer. Smells great. Really healed my dry cracked lips
perfect for more than lips i frequently get dry patches on my face. I absolutely LOVE putting this on parts of my face and lips right before bed. when i wake up i still have some on and it makes me feel great the whole day. I love it so much i almost can't sleep without applying it!
Fan-freaking-tastic This product is literally a lifesaver. I have the worst chapped lips over the winter and this product completely changes that (almost instantly!) I was experiencing some dryness after using a different product and starting using Vaseline and the dryness went away within a day. Will never use another product!
Love It Me and my babygirl use this product and it works wonders on the lips...AWESOME
"Cocoa Butter tin version! Omg! I recently received the Vaseline Lip Therapy Cocoa Butter version in an easy to carry tin (yay!) for review. It's darn good! I already plan to pick up the Aloe version as soon as it's in stores. First thing I noticed is the size of the tin. It isn't an itty bitty tin you can barely get a pinky finger in. This is a very nice size: not so small you'll run out in a week and not so big you can't pop it into a small side pocket in your purse. Next thing I noticed was the the very soft, nice scent when I opened the tin. To my nose, it's not entirely a cocoa butter scent. Maybe a super-faint baby lotion type of scent But it's by no means overwhelming or something to deter you from trying. My lips were well moisturized for an extended period of time: I'd say longer than when I use regular Cocoa butter, but about the same as with one of the mentholated chapsticks. Pro Not sticky Super convenient to use and carry Not too small a decent amount of product Cons It comes in a tin, which means you'll have to use your fingers or buy some type of small tool to dip into the tin and spread on your lips. (Some people prefer this though) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smooth, thick, and effective I'm a guy in my 20s, so skin/lip care ect, are generally not on the top of my list. But unfortunately, ever since I was a young kid, I've had skin problems. My lips are generally bad. Of all the problems, they are the most painful, and quickest to break. After trying many things, I saw a little tub of the original lip theory, and said what the heck. Worked wonders with in just a few days. One little tub lasts for ever, but I lost it, went right away and got the Cocoa-butter version. I like it much more then the original. Nice mild scent much thicker and smoother. It still feels a bit greesy, but the nice silkyness makes up for it. The active mosterizing from the cocoabutter seems to work faster as well. The only down side, the girlie pokes a bit of fun at me for using and raving about a product with cocoabutter."
"Best Lip Balm Ever I ordered this on a whim and I'm glad I did. I put this on and it lasts for hours. I'm not constantly reapplying like I do with Chapstick, Blistex and other brands, and a little goes a long way."
"Loving this Great cream, smooth texture, non greasy, hydrates well This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Lip Therapy Love the stuff! Great for chapped lips
"amazing product I absolutely adore this product!! I use it every morning and every night for soft beautiful lips the next day. At night, I actually also use it under my eyes because in the morning it helps the dark under eyes to go away and it also helps keeping my eyes and face moisturized. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Best lip treatment ever I used to use chap stick all day every day will never go back to it.This is the best lip treatment I've ever put on and lasts for hours unlike chap stick.A little goes a long way.I do wish it came in a tube for convenience :)
"Best lip therapy ever made I love this lip therapy, it's the best I've ever had. Constantly working outside and I'm dry areas for work I couldn't ask for anything better. I only wish they made this lip therapy Coca Butter in a tube, because sticking my fingers in to the jar is a turn off and gross to me. Many other people that I have talked to feel the same. So if you all could make it in a tube, stick that would make it all the better!! Thank you for the best thing to ever happen to lips!"

"Its a must have now. Every winter my lips become painfully chapped. 10x worse then my husband or kids I'm not sure why. Every year I rush to the store to find some relief! This year I wanted to get ahead of it and get chapstick before my lips got bad. Vaseline lip therapy Cocoa butter caught my attention, I absolutely LOVE IT! My lips haven't chapped AT ALL which is a blessing. I don't have to contenuassly apply it so that's always a plus and the smell and feel of it is lovely. Before I found this my lips became painfully chapped and embarrassing. I hated to kiss my husband cause of how they felt and looked. Now thanx to this product I havent have that problem. I NEVER EVER write reviews especially this long HAHA but I assure you this product is amazing."
"Worked EXTREMELY Well i usually have dry, cracked, chapped, dull lips and I always tried to to find a good moisturizer to use on my lips to lock in moisture back into my lips and try to brighten them a bit, i could never find a product like that but now i did. i used this literally just found this hours ago in my drawer and decided to use it and now i could seriously feel a big difference. this might sound gross, but my lower lip had a cut and whenever i talked or moved my lips, the cut would open and it hurt bad so after i used the vaseline, my lips don't hurt anymore and i can now move them haha. but seriously, this is a good moisturizer for your lips and tomorrow i am pretty sure i will even see better results, i look forward to trying the rosy one :)"
Best Chapstick you can get this is by far the best chap stick for your lips you can get. it is very expensive for such a small bottle but worth it.
"Love this product! Love it, but would love it in a twist off cap like a chap stick or a blistex."

Love Love Love i used my daughters and feel in love so of course I had to get my own. I've been hooked since the first application!!!
"The Absolute Best But Need Better Container I love this product and find that nothing heals my chapped lips better! The cocoa butter really soothes and repairs my skin while the petroleum jelly seals in the moisture. However, I need to be able to apply this in a more sanitary manner. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put this same product in the squeeze tube, and I'll buy more!"
"Amazed! My lips were super dry this morning and I applied this product ONCE over 12 hours ago. My lips are so smooth and soft, I'm actually amazed. I never write product reviews but cannot rave enough about how amazing this is. It is my new go-to for soft lips. I'm still in shock!"
"Love It I bought this two days ago to help my chapped lips after having a bad cold/sinus infection. I blew my nose so many times my upper lip and my nose was cracked and red, and pretty painful. This instantly soothed my lips, and it's kinda funny, but I put it on the tip of my nose and upper lip too, and now my nose is almost completely healed! I tried everything to soothe my poor nose before, and the alcohol content of other creams burn! After two days it's a 360 transformation! This stuff is the bomb!"
"Just Pure Amazinggg!!! i've tried so many lip balms (Baby lips, EOS and etc) and lets just say this one is by far the best thing ever!!! i usually apply this at night but i should start bringing this around because nothing softens my lips besides thiss!!"

Love It :) It makes my lips feel so good and I love the sents.
"My New Favorite! I have angry skin in general, I'll spare you the list, but this year has been especially bad. I have been trying different things but (a) I'm really picky, (b) when my lips are chapped I want totally clear so it doesn't stick to teeth, and (c) I hate most flavors as they make me feel nauseated, so I've not found anything that I fell in love with. On top of that, some actually caused an itchy rash *around* my lips! I also wanted to grab some regular Vaseline for a rash my doctor recommended it for, and I thought it may help my lips...I actually think the container is super cute and just use the back of my nail to get it out, and rub any excess on my hands. Immediately I fell in love with the very light scent and shine, and keep expecting to need more only to find it is still on after meals, drinking throughout the day, talking, etc. Also since its clear I can put around the edges of my lips and the side creases where mine crack without looking like a clown. It feels...absolutely luxurious. I also can put my regular lipstick on with Vaseline Lip Therapy over it for protection and shine. I've been reading about other uses for regular Vaseline and am so hopeful for other skin irritations they haventvreally been able to fix, that at least I can get some relief! So yes, I am thrilled with my cute little jar and plan to stock up - definitely recommend to anyone for year-round use!"
"Obsessed. I have the worst chapped lips during the winter but after I discovered this stuff, it has changed me forever! I throw some chapstick on and then this over it and it locks in that moisture during the day. I also use it at night after I put coconut oil on my lips and I wake up with soft, happy lips. Totally worth the money!"
"Favourite Balm This is the best lip balm that I have ever used. Lasts forever on my lips, and smells heavenly. Not too thick, a tad sticky but I'll deal with it! Makes my lips super soft, unlike most balms which just dry my lips out. And the tub is lasting me forever. Going on the third month, and its not even half empty! Love it for my winter lips."
The Best Vesline is the best.... Nothing to say. And the smell is to die for.

I Really Love This Stuff! I am a total lip balm fanatic but this has replaced every one of the many lip balms in my purse. My dry cracked lips are instantly smoothed and stay that way for a long time. I love it so much and am going to try the rose tinted one next.

"Chapped No Longer Love this one definitely the Best one I've ever used. Weather's getting cold. nothing else helped but this. when you apply it on your lips, there is this soothing feel. and in minutes my chapped, peeling lips healed like magic. I even use it on my eyelash since I do my makeup on a daily basis. Need I say more"
Best Lip Product Ever This product is amazing. Sinks in and hydrates your lips all day and night. I put this on before bed and when I wake up in the morning my lips still feel super soft and hydrated. I love it!
"This Stuff Is Amazing My lips have always had problems with getting chapped and dry, even with regular Chapstick. I got the little lip therapy one that has a hint of Rose. It's amazing! I rubbed my lips together this morning and they are so soft. They haven't been like this in years. And I love that it adds a slight pink tint when it's on my lips and it even leaves the tint after its off! I'm so in love with this product."

The Best This stuff is amazing! It works great and it isn't greasy but it soaks right into your lips and make the look and feel great This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Best Lip Care Product Ever! I've tried all three types and this is by far the best one. Just seconds after applying this to my lips they are softer, brighter, and absolutely smooth! The texture is more creamy than the original and applies much easier. I've always suffered from extremely dry lips, but this has completely taken care of the problem. I apply it once in the morning and it last nearly all day long. Will definitely be buying more!"
Lip Therapy I love it and I always love the lotion but I really wanna try you spray
Love This I love this lip balm it softens my lips I also had it in rosey lips and original I only wish there was a coconut flavour!! but it is stil is very good!!!
"New Purchase, New Love It actually lasts on the lips. After using the EOS lip balms that look cute but dried my lips out, the Vaseline Cocoa Butter lip therapy has fixed my lips and made them feel soft again. The smell is amazing as well and I cannot wait to try the rosy tinted one )"
I've Never Found A Better Product It is the only balm that stays on my lips through the night. When I wake up after applying the night before my lips feel amazing! I don't have to reapply nearly as much as any other moisturizing lip product.
this product help me look younger looking skin I have been using this product for along time and I don't want to choose another product. I am nearly 50 years old and this product make me look younger. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Wonderful Love this product. Its amazing. Made my lips super soft and silky smooth.
"Absolutely Love It!! I absolutely love the cocoa butter lip therapy. I am a lip gloss lady, therefore, I first apply the vaseline then apply my gloss right on top. It keeps my lips from drying out and it provides excellent long-lasting results! Its actually better than the regular kind. The smooth texture of the vaseline is just right - not too thick not too sticky....I have purchased the .25 oz size jar 3x's already since the beginning of the year! I keep it handy in my make-up bag and it travels w/me wherever I go! It's now a must-must product for me to have!"
Great Product Love this product. Please do not let this be a trial or be discontinued.
Love! this is the best product i have ever used for my dry lips and i have tried everything.
"Wonderful Product Since I was an infant, my mummy used vaseline on me.At 33 years am still using it and I have never used any other jelly on my skin.The new Cocoa Butter flavored is the best.Keep up the good work."
"Perfect For Those Of Us With Skin Issues Where do I begin! I have eczema chronically, so my skin can be very sensitive. Recently, I saw my dermatologist because my face was AWFUL (breaking out, itchy, cracking, etc)... turns out, I had angular cheilitis, oral thrush, AND perioral dermatitis. What the heck! My doctor told me that most lip products further irritate the condition because of all the additives, so he recommended Vaseline. I tried the regular Vaseline, but it was too runny for me... but the Cocoa Butter Vaseline... WOW!! It applies thicker than the regular variety and soothes my irritated lips."
This Is My Life Every time I use this it's as if I'm putting liquid gold on my lips. Worth every penny.
Very Soothing! The Vaseline starts working instantly! your lips start to fill so plump and smooth! it also stays on longer!
Amazing Product I needed something to keep my lips from getting dry. I use it everynight when I go to sleep and I wake up with great results!
Great Stuff. its t best stuff to use for lips. My doc recommends it.
light and airy I love this! olay discontinued my old moisturizer years ago and I had to try a few out before I settled on this product. it soaks in well and I love it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love This Lip Therapy My lips were cracked and bleeding - a coworker told me about this product and in 2 days I have beautiful soft non cracked lips again, love it!"
Worth Every Penny I will definitely be buying more I love the cocoa butter Vaseline because it smells awesome
"Amazing I have been a Burt's Bees user for almost a decade now. With the cold weather this season, my lips have been incredibly dry despite the regular application of Burt's Bees. I remembered that someone had given me the cocoa butter Vaseline lip therapy to try so when I got home that night, I decided to apply it. I cannot tell you how incredibly wonderful this product is. I never thought I would say this, but I will never go back to Burt's Bees. My lips have NEVER felt so moisturized. On top of it all, I don't have to apply it nearly as often as I would with the Burt's Bees. I cannot say it enough- this product is wonderful and I am so glad I gave it a try."
"Best ""Chapstick"" I've Ever Used! Believe my I've used many kinds of chap stick, and unlike most other chap stick brands, Vaseline soothes your lips and deeply penetrates them. Most chap stick moisturizes the surface of your lips then dries out the rest of the lip, including the surface! One of my favorite things about it is that it last's so much longer than any other leading brand's when your drinking anything, in the shower, or even swimming Vaseline stay's tight to your lip's. That's why I love Vaseline's lip therepy. They even have it colored pink for dressy occasions. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Amazing Product! This product is amazing! I recently received it as a stocking stuffer, and I've been using it everyday. It makes your lips so smooth and moisturized. My lips get extremely chapped no matter the season, and this has been getting rid of any cracking on my lips. It also moisturizes your lips for a long period of time, and stays on your lips. I like to use this at night especially, because it can really sink into the lips. Highly recommend!"
"Love It This is the best lip balm, it keeps my lips soft and I love the cocoa butter added! I was on the fence with the original but I feel like I don't know what I would do without the cocoa butter balm! Great Choice!"
"Healthy Lips Instantly! This product has been the best therapy for my dry lips ever! Very easy to apply, and pretty much instant results. My lips are smooth and healthy. Ohh, and the product packaging is so cute as well :-)"
"Love Love Love This Product! I recently been suffering from extremely dry lips. I tried everything from eos, burts bees, baby lips etc... thought I wasn't going to find anything that would soothe my dry lips. I decided to try vaseline cocoa butter lips therapy. As soon as I applied it instantly made my lips smoother and softer. I absolutely love this product and recommend to anyone who suffers from dry chapped lips. Thank you for making this product!"
"Awesome Sauce It is perfect for everything! Feet (especially in this weather), elbows, lips, knees, and whatever else! I would like for as much people as possible to indulge in this amazing product!"
Amazing Product This product is amazing. I've always wanted a lip product that give my lips a sort of glow and keeps it moisturized. This Vaseline lip therapy does this and even adds a gloss that isn't too overbearing! Absolutely love this product.
"This product is great in different categories This product is inexpensive, absorbs into my skin quickly, delivers youthful results, makes my skin feels smooth and is contained to keep product fresh. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love It! I am sensitive to many products...not this! Actually used this to recover from a reaction I had to another product. Worked very well...and quickly! By far my favorite for dry, irritated lips. Love that it's colorless and smells great too!"
This Is Thebest Stuff i just bought the lip therapy cocoa butter and its the best thing ever
Cocoa Butter Lip Therapy This is one of the best products I ever bought. I know that any time my lips feel dry I can put this on and my lips feel better. They are smooth and moisturized because of this product. I love the barrier the Vaseline creates.
"Worth Every Cent This product is the best moisturizer for my lips that I have ever bought! I use this nightly, and it has made my lips softer, more supple, and definitely more kissable. I have tried using products like Nivea, Baby Lips, Carmex, Eos (basically anything I could get my hands on) and nothing compares. This is a must have! Also, for people who sorry about getting to the bottom of the contain, I use a makeup brush as an applicator. Lip brushes are a dollar or two at Target and you can just rinse through when you're done."
Magic To My Lips!!!! I love vaseline cocoa butter. My lips are always dry so I wanted something to make them softer.This is a great product it also smells so good!! I love this product it made my lips so soft!! It's like magic to my lips!!!
It Works - Simple As That. I have eczema of the face and incredibly dry skin to boot. This stuff is worth the extra cost over basic Vaseline as it wears thicker and coats the skin and lips. It has helped ease the eczema flares and provides the long lasting moisture my skin apparently craves. It doesn't agitate anything either. I love this and swear by it.
"Amazingly Protective I have chronic angular cheilitis, which basically means my lips tear like they're made of tissue paper. My doctor told me to try Vaseline, and I saw this at the store. It smells great, stays on really well, and is literally the only thing to help my lip tearing. Thank goodness for this product! The only thing that could make it better is SPF, because I'm afraid the glossiness in the summer. Also, the packaging is really cute but it's hard to get the product out of the container when it starts to get near the bottom. I have long nails, so it's okay, but if a man with larger fingers and short nails was trying to, it might be extra difficult. Might think about a squeeze tube or something."
Love This Product it really helped my lips they were so chaped I totally recamend this product
Great Lip Gloss! This stuff is great (if I don't loose the container ) The only thing that I dont like is because I have somewhat long nails it makes it hard to get the stuff out unless you like to dig out the product with the top of your nails. I'm ready for this stuff to come out in a tube to be easier and not so messy :) Over all a great product! It smells great and has that perfect chap-stick texture to keep your lips soft!

"Different formula than normal I buy Olay Regenerist all the time from CVS and Rite Aid. This time around I purchased it from Wal Mart's online store, and when I received it, the formula was slightly different. The lotion smells like the cheaper products Olay makes. I am very disappointed and will not order from Walmart online again."
"This product is a great mosturizer. I use this product morning and night. When I use it in the morning, my foundation goes on great. When I use it at night, I wakeup with super soft skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Dermalogica cleanser Cleanses face well nice mild fragrance, love it."
nan
Great product I've been using this product for years and would recommend its use.
Excellent Product I use a lot of Dermalogica products and this is one of them. Love this cleansing gel. Its great for my skin and leaves my face feeling soft and clean. I highly recommend this product for people with acne prone skin as it works well for that.
"Not at 89.00 never ever will pay that for a fine product. It's a great product but they are crazy to think I'd or others would pay 89 for a package of two bottles of this stuff. Very crazy indeed, will change products or go without."
"Oil Of Olay Sensitive Moisturizing Lotion have used for many years and am told I look very young (in my 60's and no wrinkles). My Aunt, who is 85, and from whom I learned about the wonderful benefits of Oil of Olay, has used the regular oil of olay for umpteen years and has no wrinkles. Made me a believer! My allergies act up with any other lotion except for the Sensitive--can use even close under the eyes."
Excellent product Excellent product tough to find in stores the only product my wife uses for her sensitive skin
"Youth enhancing color for lips. i really liked this. i bought 4 in a pack. Lipsticks are too thick and messay so i use this and it is like a lip stain. I like that. It looks so natural as if my lips are really that color. Wehn you get older, your lips pale so actaully it is a sort of youth enhancing product. People don't realize you have anything on at all. Very natural looking."
"Been using for years! I have been using this cream for years and continue to prefer this to all others because it is light weight, hydrating, and non-greasy! Great product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Watermelon Shimmer Keeps Lips in the Pink 20 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No Literally. It goes on pink, not red or magenta. When seen in the store and anywhere online, no matter what type of color monitor is used, it looks reddish--and the description of it calls it magenta or red, too.It is in the tube, but it's not on your lips. It's a very pretty pink on my lips, and on my sister's lips, too. Just the right amount of color, too. Not too bright, not too dark, perfect for everyday and goes with anything.It has more color and goes on thicker than a balm, seeming more like a true lipstick than a balm or gloss.FYI, this product in the Fig color looks brownish on lips, while the Rhubarb color appears purplish in tone."
"Good, all-purpose product This is my all-purpose lipstick, and the tiny size is wonderful to save space in my purse. The only catch is that the small cap can nick the product when putting it back on--not a problem when applying at home but a challenge when on the go. And of course the small size also means the supply doesn't last too long, but long enough to be fair for the size and price. Those are small problems for an otherwise great product. It's more matte than gloss but clear gloss could be worn on top."
"Just the right amount of color 2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No I must have gone through a dozen of these lip shimmers over the past few years because they do such a good job of making my lips feel moist, even in the winter. The secret is a little bit of mint that gives chapped lips that cool feeling of being rescued from cold or windy weather in the winter or too much sun in the summer. They come in different shades from just a hint of color, in a shade like Champagne, to a fair amount in shades like Merlot. The Watermelon shade is the one that I like the best because I like the cool pink colors.The ingredients they list are: helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, beeswax, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) wax, lanolin, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, tocopheryl acetate, tocopherol, mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil. May contain: iron oxide, mica, carmine, titanium dioxide. The peppermint oil is the thing that gives it the cool feeling that makes your lips feel so moisturized. Because there are a lot of oils in it, I find that I have to reapply it fairly often, but the color is sheer so you don't have a build up like you might with regular lipsticks.I've turned so many of my friends on to this product, because once they try it, they find that they like it as much as I do."
"Very Moisturizing and Not Sticky! One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No Burt's Bees is an incredibly moisturizing lip balm/shimmer/gloss! Usually anything this moisturizing does not have the amount of color that this has. My lips feel so good after wearing this all day, but it looks as good as lipstick! It isn't sticky or smell bad like a lot of lip glosses, either. It has no taste (no strawberry, for example). I think I am one of the last holdouts to try Burt's Bees, but now I am a believer! I highly recommend it."
"amazing product! 7 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No i am a teen and i find a lot of times that lipsticks are too much, lip glosses are too sticky, lip stains are too drying and lip balms don't give a healthy color to my naturally un-pigmented lips. So I figured that a tinted lip balm would be perfect. And it is. I think it is a bit overpriced, being a small tube for over 5 dollars, but it gives such a nice color to my lips, lasts long, AND moisturizes! This is such a great product and can be worn alone for a totally natural but sweet look. I use this every day! :)"
"My strange addiction. 6 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No I have found this to be the perfect product for both the health, and cuteness of my lips--both of which are very important to me. Love the tingle, love the shimmer, love the hint of color. I was afraid the watermelon would be too dark for me, but no, it is really gorgeous. if you want something with a mauve tone, but without frost, this is the one. It is not as dark as the cap makes it look. Champagne is the one I use most often, as its very subtle, and almost a non-color, for when you want a natural look. My other favorite is peony. Love the toffee, too, but it seems they've stopped making it. Plum and caramel I need to sort of dab on lightly, but I think would be gorgeous on someone with a darker complexion. Guava--while I love the color--is a bit frosty for my taste, and since I've heard the same said about the strawberry, I have not added that to my collection. I would like if Burt's Bees would come out with a light pink that is not frosty, so I hope that they are reading this. P"
"A must have for me! Love these shimmer sticks. Beautiful color, and a cool, tingly feeling on lips. As someone who is addicted to lip balm and must have access to it at all times (otherwise lips feel distractingly uncomfortable), I really appreciate this refreshing tingle."

sticky I really wanted to like this but it left me sticky feeling all day.
"They must have changed the formula Previous Body Butter was stiff and thick, which I truly like. Must have changed the formula since local WalMart started carrying it again. It is to creamy and doesn't stick to the skin like the previous Tree Hut. Had to return Coconut Lime scent, did not like. I will search for another Body Butter that will be thicker and not go on like a lotion. Sorry."
Sticky sticky sticky Left me sticky all night long couldn't even sleep had to take another shower
tree hut shea butter Relieved my itching and moisturized my skin.
"Amazing moisture/ Disappointing scent Based on Tree Hut Original Shea body butter's amazing in scent and performance, I purchased the coconut lime body butter without smelling it 1st. Others who reviewed it said it compared to one of my favorite Bath and Body Works scents, Coconut Lime Verbena. Perhaps I have ended up with a defective product. The scent is neither coconut or lime. It is somewhere between stale Crisco and expired sunscreen. Even though I stink right now, my skin is drenched in the rich moisture that Tree Hut Body Butter delivers."
"tree hut lotions I really do love the tree hut products , but for the people with paraban allergies like me the best tree hut product is the shea body lotion coconut lime and the shea body lotion hawaiian kukui. I love to use this on the hands and feet with my massage clients. Ho yes , I am a licesed massage practioner at Hand and stone massage and facial spa in Vancouver, Wa . (Tammy L) :) Thank you"
"Smells of summer! Keeps dry skin at bay, while keeps the smell of summer year round."
Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream Love this product. Works as it says. Wish it was available earlier for all of the women who try to take good care of their skin for a reasonable cost. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"A high quality lotion I bought this Tree Hut body butter one winter in desperation of finding a lotion that would actually cure my dry skin. It did! Living in Arkansas where the winters are chilling and unforgiving to hands I was amazed at how well it protected them. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin, like I do, and who is looking for a great inexpensive way to cure your dry skin. I use it now daily on my legs and face and have no problems. The product is a little thick going on at first, so I don't think oily skin would experience as much of a benefit as dry."
"Best Product for Dry Cracked Heels !! I stumbled across this product but after using several brands, this was by the far the best I've ever tried for extremely dry, cracked heels. I use every night and morning. Within 3 days my deep cracked heels were so much better almost completely healed. I would highly recommend, give it a try what do you have to lose. My daughter couldn't believe the difference. Trust me it works and I never write reviews but had to share this one !!! I use the Coconut Lime, love the smell."
"Great for Heel Fissures I tried everything, even RX strength meds for my cracked feet and heels. This product hands down works the best and is the least expensive of everything else I tried."
LOVE THIS SMELL I got this for Christmas this last year 2016 from my niece and brother and This smells AMAZING. it smells so clean and I love the clean smell. I use it all the time and now have to buy more since my birthday is coming up D
"AMAZING!!!!!!!!! I have VERY SENSITIVE SKIN and the only lotion that worked for me was the Palmer's Coco Butter. I found Tree Hut at another department store and it was the Tree hut Body Butter and Body Wash. I figured since it is 100 Natural, that it would hurt my skin. So I took it home and Tried it out.......AMAZING!!!!! After using it, I look it up online and I was VERY impressed. Walmart is the Cheapest this to purchase this product. I paid double at a different department store. HIGHLY recommended.....You wont be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!! My favorite scent is coconut-lime and Brazilian-Nut"
"Absolutely fabulous!! Anything less than a 5-star rating, is totally crazy!! Smells nice. Nice amount, for a great price!! Please don't raise price, just because this is a good product. Thank you!"
"Give it a try! I have a sensitivity to overwhelming fragrances, but this is really pleasant. I've been using it off and on for years and I find myself returning to the product."
I would like to buy it again I bought what I want and I love it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love the scent smooth feeling! I have been using this body butter lotion for over 2 years now. I am very happy with both. I use the lotion in the warmer months, the body butter during winter. I was originally a Bath Body Works customer. Then they discontinued the Lemon Coconut. I am so very glad I found a replacement at such a reasonable price. I hope Walmart keeps this product in it's inventory for many years to come. It keeps my skin moist smooth with a touch of fragrance. Love it!"
"Just what I need Love the look I get when using this product, My skin looks refreshed, smooth and younger. This is a product I will continue to use for years to come. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Fabulous! I love this. I put it on after the shower from neck to toes and feel great all day and smell wonderful too. No need to moisturize for the rest of the day except for hands from washing them. I put a little in a container and carry it in my purse for that.
Super Moisturizer The scent and texture is so amazing. It exceeded the expectations that I had. I love this product so much I purchased two jars. I would recommend this to all my friends. It has a lasting scent and is extremely moisturizing.
Awesome Smell This body butter is very silky and smooth going on. Keeps skin hydrated. This is my second time purchasing this product...
Excellent product. Totally love it!!!! It smells great. It feels greats. Long lasting moisture with a hint of natural fruit extracts. My skin adores this. I don't know how I used any other moisturizer
Awesome!!! I love the smell and how it feels on my body. I have to hide it from my roommate :)
love it very moist
"Love it Very creamy, thick, lasts all day. Smell good not to strong."
Love the smell I've been using this product for quite some time and just love it. This is a great price for it too as it's usually offered for over 7.
Amazing! Great scent!
Love it!! Love this body butter! It smells incredible! It reminds you of being on vacation! I only wish it was available in the store also.
BEST FOR THIS OLD LADY I have used this moisturizer for quite a while now and I really needed it. I'll never look 18 again but at least I don't look nearly as old as I am. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Rich and creamy Love the richness and the delicious smell of this great body cream!
"Smells Great, and moisturizes Goes great with the coconut body scrub!"
"came just in time i have not used it yet but it was the best deal i found on the internet and it came early , will definitely use"
"This is a very good product I am going through menopause and it is taking my hair out. I use it 3 times a week on the edges of my hair and I see a really big difference, now when I braid my hair I can actually catch all of the edges! Bravo Cococare"
CoCoCare As advertised
"Decent makeup remover This is good for removing just a bit of leftover mascara or whatever else, not necessarily a full face of makeup. I found that when i tried to remove a full face of makeup, I had to use an excessive amount of product. This works best for eye makeup, specifically smaller amounts. I would suggest washing your face and using this to touch up afterwards. This product gently removes makeup and doesn't sting however, it leaves a bit of a greasy feel."
"Lovely product !! Awsum product , removes make up with less effort n feels like a moisturizer with awsum smell."
Maybelline The Flash Clean Clean Express Very good makeup remover. Smell is very pleasant.
"Best make-up remover on the market! No matter which method I use to remove make-up, I finish up with this. I'm amazed that this product works like it does to really get down in the pores and lift out hidden residue. I'm sold on this and I'm not easy to convince. Maybelline products have come a long way in competing with high end cosmetic companies that I have used for years, such as Dior. I'm very happy to purchase Maybelline at 1/4 the price I have been paying!"
It smells bad I ordered this through walmart.com. Maybe i got a very old product. The packaging looked dirty and old. The lotion smells bad.
This is just a wonderful product. I just trust it to keep my skin renewed. I see the results daily. I don't have to be looking and experimenting with other brands others than Olay. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Made my hands dryer. I was very disappointed in this product. It didn't make my nails stronger at all, and it actually made my hands dryer. I've used the body lotion and the essential healing hand cream for a long time and love them."
"Does no more than water For the price I expected this to be one of the better hand creams. The moisturiser is non-greasy but soaks in and dries so fast that it feels like it has just evaporated. With every use my hands were left just as dry as before. I gave the cream weeks of use to see if it would improve, but it never did. I applied more and more with each use and more often throughout the day but it never made a difference. My hands were getting so bad they were cracking and bleeding. I've resorted to another brand entirely and use it only once a day and the change and improvement in my skin was instant and fixed my damaged broken skin in under a week. Don't waste your money on this cream."
"Instantly moisturizes my hands This is a great product if you have dry skin or wash your hands a lot like I do because of work. The nail growth part I cannot really say as my nails are already in great shape but my hands are definitely softer. Only con is the smell, not so pleasing."
"Great lotion, bad smell I recently bought this lotion because of it's convenient size (3 ounces). I did not read the bottle before buying it, so I was pleasantly surprised when I got home that it helps keep nails stronger, since I've been trying to find a product that works for that. It also really works on my rough, dry feet! However, the smell is very unpleasant. I really don't like it, I believe it is the keratin I am smelling in it since some of my shampoo smells similar, but this lotion just doesn't smell the best! I'd like a new formula that helps with the smell."
Lotion that works I like the way it makes my hands feel and look. I like it.
Product Is Great But The Smell Is Not! I used to use this years ago and it has always given amazing results however the smell of it is what turned me off from continuing to purchase it. I only purchase it every once in awhile when my hands are extremely dry and wrinkly looking. When it comes to skin and hair products I am all about the fragrance....it has to smell good as well as work good so that I can smell good when wearing it! I just don't like the weird harsh almost chemical disinfectant-like fragrance of this lotion and wish that Vaseline would change it!!! If this lotion smelled like cherries or coconut or vanilla I would buy it by the gallon!!!
Love Only problem is the size. Would be more economical if it came in a larger size.
VERY GOOD PRODUCT Stronger nails after a week of daily use. Not that much moistrurising for dry skin
Stinks but great nails!!! Just discovered this product and I have never had nice nails. My hand look wonderful now. But this really STINKS to have on your hands and would love a unscented version. PLEASE!!!!
very good Its good but better for summer time. My hands and fingers still crack.
the best cream for your face this cream is great.make your feels so good. the dryness just dissappears and makes your skin feel so new and refreshed.love this cream IS PERFECT. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love this lotion EXCEPT ..... I recently had to buy a new tube of this lotion after I had squeezed every last possible drop out of my old tube, only to find that the lotion in the new look tube really STINKS. I love this lotion, but the new formula () does NOT have the same pleasant smell that my old tube of lotion did. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I REALLY don't like the way the new stuff smells, and it makes my hands stink, almost so bad that I have to go wash it off."
"Best lotion for hands ever I used to use this product, but you changed the scent and because of allergy's I can no longer use it. I'm not very good at taking care of my cuticles, but with this lotion I don't have to worry about that. This is absolutely the best lotion I've ever used. Please reconsider either going back to the old scent or make it scent free for people with allergy's like me. Thank You. I can't give it 5 stars because I can no longer use the lotion."
"Best. Lotion. Ever. but... My mom stuck a tube of this in my stocking a few years ago and I've been hooked ever since. I love the way it makes my hands feel and that it's not greasy. I do agree with a previous review I read that it could smell a little more pleasing but that's not a huge issue for me. My problem lies with the fact that this only comes in a tiny, 3 oz tube. Why would you not offer more options If you want a customer to be loyal to you and your product, you need to make things as convenient and economical as possible. I am torn by my love for the product and the hassle it is for me to have to take multiple trips to the store to constantly restock or be forced to be a hoarder and buy multiple tubes at once. I will be honest that my frustration has made me consider switching to another brand altogether."
Good lotion This is the first time using this type of lotion but it seems to keep your hands soft with an ok scent
"Best Hand Lotion I started using this hand lotion a while back and noticed a difference in my hands appearance and my nails have for sure been stronger with no splitting, it has also healed my dry cuticles. I keep one at my desk and on my nightstand. I use bleach and other cleaning products at home which dry my hands out and ever since I started using the Vaseline Healthy Hands my hands have been nice and smooth with nice nails and cuticles. I really wish this was sold in a larger bottle as I like to apply at least 3 times a day."
"love it! I found this on my own. I would definitely recommend it to others, in fact I have. It smells nice and has a great consistency."
Amazing Product I've used this product years ago. Loved it. But then their formula changed and it wasn't as good. Then I purchased it recently and it's back to what it was. I love this product.
Great for extremely dry hands! Best lotion I've found for my dry hands with the bonus of making your nails look better with a reduced cuticle as well.
Amazing This is an amazing lotion. It is moisturizing and bot greasy. Leaves my skin feeling so soft.
"Great Product! Have loved this hand lotion for years but PLEASE, PLEASE bring back the pump size bottles. So much easier to use after washing hands or doing dishes."
Best Ever The only product I have ever used that I could truly tell made a difference in my skin. Even my husband commented how much younger my skin looked. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
It really works good! I have used alot of lotions and creams on my hands-and this stuff works wonders!
good product love this product but why does it only come in the small 3 oz. tubes now. it used to come in the bigger pump bottles. i really liked them better
"I love it , excellent for my hands!! Definitely awesome hand cream leaves my hands super soft."
"Total Moisture Hand Cream Great stuff! Not greasy, keeps hands smooth. New package but seems the same great lotion."
Gone Dry Hand It's really help my hand area such us my nail more strong . my hand more soft n smooth . my cuticle is gone )
A very good product First using and knowing it exist
Love this lotion great product
awesome makes my nails soo hard i love it would keep buying
excellent lotion Excellent lotion for hands and nails. Please bring back the pump bottle.
"Best Hand Cream This is the best hand cream I have ever used. I can't figure out why it is getting hard to find in the stores. I have had to order on line twice and stock up. I keep one in the kitchen, one in my purse and one in the powder room. It isn't gooey and absorbs nicely."
"Great product ,great company GREAT product , but I expected nothing less from this company,I am a senior and as most seniors i am getting dry skin,this product is very good. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Better than many more expensive products I love this product. I keep a tube in my kitchen for after I'm done cleaning up. My cuticles and nails are noticeably better when using this regularly. My only complaint is I couldn't find any in the stores. Had to order online. Was happy I was able to do that.
"Best Lotion! When I bought this product, I was looking for something that would keep my hands from drying out. After a week of using it, my nails grew faster and my hands were not dry at all! I absolutely love it! I recommend this product for anyone who has dry hands."
Need bigger bottle I love this lotion. It is not greasy. I love everything about it except that I need a bigger bottle to keep at my nightstand. I have to keep pulling the 3oz one from my purse every time I have to use it. Please consider in selling it in bigger bottle pump. Thanks
Love it! My boyfriend and I both love this product!!! It doesn't have a greasy feeling to it and makes the hands feel super soft!!! And doesn't have a horribly girly fragrance to it so he will use it! The only complaint is that it doesn't come in a bigger bottle. Please make it in a bigger bottle!
"Love the standout pink bottle Great product! Never a greasy residue, absorbs quickly and completely. Noticeable improvement."
Great for my skin Was incredible for my very dry skin. I love it!! I would recommended this product This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Healthy Hand Nail Formula is Best Ever LOVE LOVE LOVE This product. I've finally used up all I had in stock. Please put this back into a larger pump bottle. The small tubes are nice, but bring back the large pump size. This formula is too good for only a small bottle."
Great stuff! LOVE this product! It does not leave a greasy film on your hands and makes them so soft. My nails and hands were much improved after just a couple of uses.
"Love it At first I was sceptical abou the stronger nails, but whoow, it does not only make my hands much smoother (what I did have faith in and why I bought it) but my nails have become much stronger in just a few days!"
Awesome Hi I Melissa and I love this lotion for my hands especially during this time of year because my whole body is so dry and this lotion I can actually use and feel the difference I LOVE VASALINE BRAND!!! ...:-)
Hand cream Smells like a lemon cookie. Absolutely love!!! My kids love it.
"what happened my mother and i have vowed by this product for years and years... when i first started paying attention to skincare, she gave me a bottle of olay regenerist and it's all i've ever needed ... the only thing that works (and i have spent so much money exploring more high-end brands)! so you can understand why i'm upset that the formula was tampered with... this new and improved cream smells awful (the scent is way too strong), it appears that they've watered it down, it's mushy on my face and if i touch my face at any point during the day, it starts peeling off... it's greasy and does not work well under makeup at all! my mom and i are now forced to look for a whole new line of products when we've stayed with olay for our whole lives. sad, sad, sad. BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!"
wonderful and easy to use use it for years easy always after a shower. tho I am 88 NO ONE has ever guess it always thin I am in eary 70s. even the nurses made me prove it This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Vaseline intensive care Works great. Smells really good. Love this product and definitely recommend it.
Awesome product I love this product and strongly recommende this it is wonderful product and has done wonders for me
Amazing product I have tried everything to strengthen my brittle nails and dry cuteculs. This is the best thing that has ever worked. I wish it was in a bigger bottle. My nails and hands nails have never looked better.
Please bring back the larger bottle!! I love this lotion. I just wish I could get it in the larger pump size bottle. It is also getting more difficult to even find the smaller 3oz bottles.
"Excellent Product This is an excellent hand lotion!!! It makes my hands so soft, I carry it everywhere I go and I have some on my desks at work and home. I just wish it came in a larger size like it use to"
"Oh my goodness! All of my life I have had brittle peeling nails. I discovered this hand lotion over five years ago and when I find it in the store I stock up! I keep one on my desk at work and use it throughout my day, one in my purse (that I frequently use before driving), and last but now least beside my bed to use every single night. Recently I've noticed the bottle changing shapes. I'm not sure if it is a new formula but my nails are the best they have ever been! Please make these in a larger size and put in more retail locations!!!"
"Amazing amazing amazing!! I absolutely love this product. I buy this every summer it does wonders for my nails. I hope they never quit making this product. I get compliments on my nails every summer get asked what I use that my nails are so nice strong...I show them my bottle of Vaseline Intensive care for hands nails!! I'm not kidding people think my nails are fake, they're so perfect!"
"Fantastic product - I highly recommend For years I suffered with exceedingly dry hands, particularly in the winter, but most bothersome was the fact that my nails were soft, splitting/peeling - they just would not grow. Everyone was telling me to go the acrylic nail route but I did not want to go down that road and be a slave to that process, much less the money it would cost. I began using this product about 2 years ago and within about 6 months my nails were definitely harder and no longer splitting - and my hands were no longer chapped with those bothersome little cuts at the juncture of my fingers/nail tips and absolutely not as dry and hurtful. I found that it was important to use it at least every night before going to bed and to work the lotion into my nail beds (no gloves are needed as it is readily absorbed). It really has worked for me and I've told all my friends about it to help them as well. Be patient if you're considering using it to strengthen your nails - it will work, believe me, but it does take time. Good luck!"
Good Smell good and useful

"This product has supported elasticity I love this product. It has help to return my skin brightness and tightness. As I age, I recognized the need to support my health in all areas. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Very good! My problematic skin loves it.
awesome Love It! My HandS Are So Soft And My Nails Are Already Harder After One Week!
"Want larger sizes!!! I've used and loved this product since 1988. Until 2011 or so, I've had the biggest bottle with the pump on my nightstand. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BRING BACK THE LARGER SIZES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Why not in stores The product is still very good and my only complaint is why can't it still be stocked at store level so I don't have to pay postage when I need a refill...
Does miracles! My nails and hand skin have been in very bad shape for the past three years and now they are beginning to look beautiful again. My nails are growing back (I'm a compulsive nail biter) and stronger. Honestly I didn't expect much of this product at first -maybe because of its very affordable price- but it really works! I couldn't recommend it more!
"Love I just happened to pick this up as an impulse buy, and was pleasantly surprised. I really love how it absorbs into the skin not leaving it greasy at all. I wish they made this available in the bigger sizes as well, to use on the whole body."
"Love this! Needs Bigger bottle! We have eczema and psoriasis in our family. I have no where near what my mother deals with, but I get very dry, sore, almost raw spots on my hands. I'm also a big hand washer. I've tried specifically made lotions for this issue and they are just so darn greasy and it never feels as thought it really penetrates my skin. This lotion is amazing! I go thought a tube about 1x every 3 weeks. I wish they made it in the larger pump size. Its done wonders for my hands and nails. Being a diabetic I can get peeling and splitting nails, but the problem has greatly decreased. Love this lotion!"
"Finally, There's Truth in the Labeling After using this product for a little over two weeks, my hands and nails look and feel very healthy and smooth."
"Soft, Silky Hands I simply adore this lotion and its fragrance, as does my husband. I'm allergic to so many perfumes and this one seems to skip by my nasal sensitivities. I'm sad that it doesn't come in a larger pump bottle any longer. I bought a dozen so I could refill my old pump bottle. I also like to carry the smaller tubes in the car with me. My hands couldn't be softer and my nails do seem to crack less using this product."
Best Hand Nail lotion I can find. My wife uses this lotion several times a day after washing her hands and before going to bed. She has very soft hands and healthy nails. She always carries a tube of this lotion in her handbag also. I use the lotion during dry cold winter months when my hands tend to get dry and I am very pleased with the results. We would definitely recommend the Vaseline Total Moisture Hand Nail Conditioning Lotion.
"Sunblock in the cream....amen Perfect, luxurious, clean smelling, quickly absorbing, deeply hydrating, sunblock protecting, moisturizing cream. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
The only hand lotion that works I have been using this lotion for decades. I am 67 and my hands are the softest ever. I have had people comment on them. I couldn't find it anymore so that's why I ordered it online. The site was easy to use and it arrived in 2 days as stated. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great Lotion and Not Greasy Very good moisturizer in a convenient small size that's perfect for next to the computer, purse, in the car or next to the bed without looking too cluttered. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Awesome!! love this product..this is the.only product I have found that actually helps strengthen my fingernails and they are finally actually growing
"Can't live without it!!! Not only is Healthy Hands Nails great for encouraging nail growth and cuticle health, but it's great for minor scrapes, burns/sunburns, and cuts. It's the only thing that's made a dent in my young son's diaper rash after trying Desitin Neosporin."
"Good bye scabby crustiness. Magic in a tube. I was wandering through the store, just browsing, and saw this lotion. Thought to myself, why not, since I've got the money, and nothing's ever worked before, and everything I've ever tried leaves me with palms that feel like I soaked them in pure grease. I get terrible eczema on the backs of my hands in the winter, because of the frost. It can get so bad that the skin cracks and starts to bleed, and then I suffer from scabbed over skin for weeks on end, that feels as dry and rough as sandpaper. And this year, it got so bad it reached up to my wrists. I've been using this hand cream for a whole three days now, applying maybe 4 to 8 times during the day. The scabs have healed and are gone, my skin feels soft and soothed, and my fingers and palms feel nice and dry, no greasy feeling at all. There is still a small patch of skin that feels a tiny bit dry to the touch on both hands, but those will probably heal up in a day or two more. The scent is noticeable upon application, but once I've worked the cream into my skin, I don't notice the scent as much, except just when I have my hands very close to my nose. Then the scent is pleasant and not too strong at all. I'll let you know if it improves the condition of my nails and cuticles as well, in the two weeks promised. The cuticles do already look a bit better, but I didn't buy this hand cream for them. So, over all, this hand creams is magic in a tube for me. I'll definitely be going to that store again, to buy some more. Thank you, for saving me from my curse of scabby crustiness. :D"
Limited stores and small size only available I can't use many products due to my sensitivity to fragrances or perfumes so when I found this lotion a few years ago I was so excited I found something that worked. I used to buy the big bottle to have around at work and home but now all I can find is the small bottle that doesn't last long. Please bring back the big bottle. I love this product and hope you never change or discontinue this product.
Best hand lotion ever I have been using this hand lotion for over 20 years now. In my childhood and teen years I had ecema on my hands and back then the treatment was cortisone. Needless to say my skin is very thin now on my hands and very sensitive and dry. I could not do without this lotion. It keeps my nails beautiful and you never know my history. My hands always look good with healthy skin and nails. Love this studf
"Where Can I Buy This Have used this product for many years and my nails are long and strong my cuticles look good all the time with minimal care. However, I have been unable to find this in any of the stores that I usually buy it and have looked in all of them all the way up and down the west coast. What is happening I will really be upset if you are not going to offer this product any more."
I love this This really did make my nails stronger and they feel so much more healthier I use this every night and it feels great on my hands the only bad thing about it is that it dosent keep your hands moisturized for a long time it tends to wear off in a couple hours so a couple applications is needed but other than that it's a great lotion !
"Best hand cream ever Just bought this hand cream on a whim yesterday and I am in love. My hands were so much softer after just one use. It also doesn't leave my hands all greasy, it drys in well :) I love the smell too, it is my new favourite hand cream. Will be buying another one for my mom as I know she'll love it!!"
"Love, love love this product! This product is the best and I cant recommend it enough. Keeps my skin feeling fresh and healthy all year long! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Best Lotion for Work I've been using this lotion for almost a year now. Love it! Sit on my desk at work. Isn't greasy so I can put it on, rub it in, and get back to work. Doesn't have a strong frangrance either. I only wish it came in a bigger bottle. I go through about a bottle every two months. More during the dry winter months. Would just be easier if it came in a bottle with a pump."
"Vaseline for hands and nails I absolutely love this product, lives up to it's claims .. my hands and nails are beautiful and strong.. but I need a big bottle pump, I know I've seen it somewhere.. I love this small size for my purse, but would like the big bottle for my desk and home... I am begging you to bring it back... thanks."
"Works great , keeps my skin very smooth Works great and helps keep my skin nice and smooth!"
Can't believe how strong my nails are Best lotion I have ever used.Absorbs quickly and my nails are so strong I have to trim them.I have never had that problem before. Like the others would love to have a pump bottle too.
Great I love this product my skin feel softer thanks to this product.
Excellent product used for over 40 years Excellent product used it for over 40 years.my entire families used these Vaseline product as well.even shipped it to them overseas.for children as well as for adults.use it everyday my self.
Bottle size I absolutely love this product. I use it every day! I have a tube in my dest at work and I decant it i to pump bottles for home. Please could you consider selling it in not only bigger bottles but also in a smaller handbag friendly bottle too (i.e. not a flip top tube as this can get very messy it it opens accidentally) Thank you!!
"Love It I love this product. My hands become very dry during the winter, and I randomly picked this at the store. Thankfully, I did because my hands feel such relief when I apply. My hands are no longer cracked and gross feeling or old looking. Works wonders for me!!"
"Fantastic Absolutely the best lotion for hands, cuticles and nails! Not easy to find!"
Soft hands Great product. Really helps my dry hand condition.
"Moisture This is the best moisturizer, feels so silky and hydrates really well. I am 60 years old and it's great for me This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Vaseline Hand lotion It is very moisturizing and not greasy!
Good Very good product
So happy I found this again!!! I love this lotion. It actually does wonders for my nails. What I don't understand is why you can't find it in store any more. I order about six bottles just in case. Walmart shipped fast and took the time to tape the tops of the bottles so they wouldn't leak.
"5 stars not much to say, just that it's a good hand cream and protects hands skin and nails very well"
Unbelievable!!!!! This is by far the BEST hand lotion I have ever used! I wish it came in a larger dispenser.
"None oily, creamy It heal's your skin making it feel hydrated to the touch nice and silky with remarkable outcome with a refreshing fregreance."
"Love the product but wish was larger siza I have worn fake nails for years because my own nails where so weak and brittle. But since I started using the Vaseline Healthy Hands stronger nails I have ditched the fakes and love the look and feel of my real nails. My only wish is that it came in a larger size. I keep a tube at my desk, in my purse, in my gym bag, in my car, by the kitchen sink and by my bed. I love this stuff and the way it keeps my hands soft and helping me grown my nails!"
Great Product I would rec this product to anyone.It really keeps the skin so soft and you can feel the difference in your skin.
"The BEST non-greasy hand lotion! I live in a humid climate, and my skin isn't extremely dry, but was looking for a hand lotion that didn't leave my hands super greasy, yet still conditioned my nails and cuticles. It seems even the lotions that claim to not be greasy, are indeed greasy, so when I came across this lotion, I thought it would just be like allll the others. I was wrong! It has a light fresh scent, sinks in quickly, and does appear to be improving the condition of both my nails and cuticles! It does a great job of smoothing the skin around the nails. I've tried sooo many hand lotions in the past, and they are ALL inferior to this product. I'm a really happy customer, and my hands thank you! :)"
Vaseline hands n nails I have winter massive dry skin brittle nails but I love this and it smells so nice too
Smoothes your skin I have used this product over the years and like how it leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized all day. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Greatest Wonderful for nails and hands!
"Wonderful for hands and nails I have used this product frequently over several years. I am always happy with the results. It can be hard to find, so I was glad to see it on Walmart.com."
"Bring back the larger pump bottle, please!! I really love this product. I have very dry hands and my nails were never very strong. This lotion really helps with both of those issues. I just don't understand why Vaseline (Unilever) decided to stop selling the larger pump bottle version. It's my fault, I suppose. Every time I find something I really like, the company changes it. It was so nice to have a bottle on my desk at work and another one at home. Then I would carry the small tube in my purse. There are plenty of other Vaseline lotions in pump bottles which I would omit long before this one. PLEASE bring it back!!! (I said please!). Thanks!!"
"Great lotion I have very dry hands and this works great!! Since it's Vaseline I expected it to be greasy, but it's not at all. It dries quickly which is very nice and after it dries it doesn't have a scent (which I like also)"
"Vaseline Healthy Hands/Stronger Nails Great product. Spend winters in AZ with dry hands cracking nails. This takes care of both. Hard to find in stores so eBay is best source, the price is right if you look."
"Want Larger Sizes!!! I've used and loved this product since 1988. Until 2011 or so, I've had the biggest bottle with the pump on my nightstand. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BRING BACK THE LARGER SIZES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"A mess! Lotion was watery and separated when it arrived. I've used this product before and it was excellent--its thick, concentrated consistency allowed a little to go a long way. But this time the consistency was completely off. I don't know if it was the temperature during storage or the delivery process, or why this was a bad batch but if I try it again, I'll be sure to purchase in-store rather than online."
This product was great! This product has done what claimed it could do. I am very satisfied with the product and will continue to use. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
One Star The product I received will expire in three month!!!!
"Not Tear Free Not Useful The first time I used in my infant, he rubbed his eyes and cried. Have never used it again for him. Do yourself a favor and buy something else for an infant or toddler that is tear free."
"Parents Beware I am extremely disappointed in this product. Make sure you test on small patch of your child's skin before using. I have used several other Aveeno products with no problem so bought for my child. Liberally applied following directions to my child's face. This product giving him a severe allergic reaction with his cheeks and nose puffed up, skin became inflamed red and eyes nearly swollen shut. Think allergy is to the sunscreen protection ingredients. So sad and just awful for my baby."
"Pathetic Expiration Date Came with expiry date within 3 months, how in this holy world someone can expect a baby to finish this lotion in given duration. Disappointed!!"
Caused Allergy ! My baby eyes went all watery with this cream. I don't believe it's baby product. I wish I had read the reviews before hand.
I would definitely not recommend it to anyone with sensitive My husband used it for the first time during his day off in a business trip and got an awful sunburn with puffy face and eyes. And this was not even in a particularly sunny place: it was in Munich in early Spring. I would definitely not recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin
I Will Never Buy This Again. I applied this twice to my son while we were only outside for 40 minutes and he got burnt anyways. You could see it melting off of him. It's thick and sticky. It feels really greasy. It doesn't spread well. Really mad I wasted my money on this.
"Not Tearless I literally have no idea why a product for babies and children would not be tearless. I have sworn by Aveeno products for years for both of my children's eczema. But within 20 minutes of application, and for hours after, both my 3 year old and 3 month old were screaming over this spf getting in there eyes. Frankly, I'm furious. I expected better from this brand. Trashing this ASAP."
"Used To Be The Only Sunscreen My Kids Could Use, Now It Stings And Causes A Rash. My kids both have sensitive skin and they have always been able to use this brand. In the last 6 months they have had multiple reactions to this sunscreen, from stinging to rashes, to causing a horrible eczema outbreak that needed steroids to treat. I'm not sure what changed with this formula, but we sadly need to find another brand for our family."
"My Personal Horror Story When someone slaps the word BABY on a product, you assume it's baby friendly! I just went through the fiasco of a SCREAMING baby because it is not eye gentle! Every mom knows how hard it is to wash something out of a baby's eyes! Washing made it even worse because when you wash it, it starts acting like soap and gets worse! How is a baby supposed to go swimming and/or sweat without this stuff washing into their eyes ADVERTISING MILD AS WATER IS SUCH A LIE! Last time I checked, water didn't burn my eyes unless it was chlorine or salt water! Either case, false advertising! Granted, there is a tiny section on the back that said to keep out of eyes. I don't know about you, when you have a squirming child... You hardly take the time to read the back carefully unless you so happen to be next to the darn bottle while using the bathroom. However, in this case, I didn't go squirting sunscreen in my child's eyes or run it near the eyes. I simply applied the lotion on his face (as recommended by doctors) and any EXPOSED BODY PARTS which in turn, includes his HANDS. Which makes sense unless a parent plans on sending a child out with gloves at all seasons of the year! I admit to poor judgement on my part on not thinking it through clearly. However, as I mentioned earlier on, when one slaps the words baby and mild as water, one assumes it is gentle for ALL PARTS OF THE BABY including the EYES! I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND! However, I can make sound judgement that as far as skin use, it is gentle... But after dealing with a screaming baby and struggling to wash it out for 10 minutes, then having the baby fall asleep after the fiasco because of exhaustion, followed by having to wait an additional hour before continuing my plans, I would say this product is an inconvenience to have. It wasn't even his nap time! My suggestion is to do more research and find a better product that is truly baby safe, in all spectrums worthy of using the label BABY. Truly, One PO'ed and Distressed Mother"
I love this product I am in my seventies and get compliments all the time on my skin. I don't leave home without putting it on!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Terrible! Stings Skin And Eyes Water! I use a lot of Aveeno products so did not think in the slightest I'd have to worry about their baby sunscreen being unsafe. We starting using this on our baby and noticed every time we were outside she got very watery eyes and we couldn't figure why. After a couple applications, we realized the eye watering only occured when we applied the sunscreen. Turns out it was stinging her skin so she was rubbing her face and then her eyes making them water! The eyes stopped watering when we changed brands. Do not recommend!"
"Caused Peeling Skin When first used product we didn't have any issues, after second use my son had a few eczema spots return but didn't put connection together but after third use not only did eczema get worse but his skin started peeling to raw red skin between ankle folds and feet."
It Burns My Son's Skin How can a product made for babies can be so uncomfortable and harmful just after you apply it burns your skin!!!! Aveeno should review the ingredients on this product.
"Broke Out In Hives I tend to have sensitive skin, and I enjoy using natural products, so I thought this product would be the perfect choice. I started to slowly break out in hives after using this. It took me several days to figure out what was going on- I was almost convinced that I had bed bugs! I went to urgent care and they had me take prednisone, pepcid, and zyrtec for five days. I had hives on my face, neck, chest, arms, and I was on my second week at a new job..."
"Burns Every Time I Put It On I bought this to use myself as a daily moisturizer, thinking it would be gentler and more hydrating than the adult version. Every time I put it on my face burns. I've never experienced this with any other product. Why does it burn"
"Severe Reaction, I Would Never Recommend This Product I was so disappointed in this product, when applied to my sons face he had immediate stinging, burning and irritation to face area. It bothered he so much that almost right away he rubbed it in his eye to make matters worse. If I was Aveeno I would immediately by removing your gentle as water from the label, because this product is anything but gentle."
Did Not Work At All. My daughter has really sensitive skin. I applied this thoroughly and many times while we were in the sun. She still burned. It also cause her to break out in a rash. I haven't found a single sunscreen that doesn't make her break out.
Triggers Eczema I accidentally bought the Continuous Protection instead of Natural Protection and after two uses my daughter's cheeks and neck were covered in eczema breakouts. We used Natural Protection all summer last year and this never occurred.
"Eczema Trigger It took us some time to figure out why my 3 year old's daughter's face kept having eczema flareups. Then, after several winter months of no eczema, we went outside on a sunny day after applying this sunscreen. She broke out in a horrible rash. We didn't make the connection and thought it was a food trigger. The next time we used the sunscreen it happened again. :( It triggers her eczema within hours and then we have about a week fighting to calm the eczema back down."
"Something Makes My Eyes Burn I have used Aveeno products for years, but I started to notice my eyes burn almost all day. At first I thought it was due to allergies, but I started noticing the burning sensation immediately after using the product, and have not been outside yet."
Regenerist deep hydration regenerating cream I love this cream as it softens my skin and being a senior lady I have found this product is the best for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Not Even For Adults! I have very sensitive skin and figured Aveeno Baby would be the right choice for sunscreen. After two uses, both resulting in large red welted areas on my chest I realized it's the sunscreen. Fine on arms but on my chest it's a no go."
"Causes A Burn-like Rash! Like the other reviewers we've also had terrible luck with this supposedly gentle (and expensive!) product. My girl breaks out in an awful rash every time I use it. I am still looking for a sunscreen that will work for her, but am disappointed because I thought obviously Aveeno would be the go-to for sensitive skinned babies : ("
"Not Sensitive Enough My 6 year old daughter has sensitive skin, and after using last week, her face broke out in patches of very red, rough dry chapped places, like eczema. i had to put aquaphor on her patches for days until they cleared up. her chest and upper arms had a dry-type pink rash too. Im not going to be able to use this on her while at the beach for a week, or she will be covered in rash."
"Disappointed As Well! I was also disappointed by the fact that this is labeled for babies and mild as water but all of my children had a reaction to it. Even the ones that don't have as sensitive of skin had patches of eczema all over their faces. Would not recommend this product, especially not for children which is what it is marketed for!"
"Very Disappointed! My children have sensitive skin and we always use aveeno products. Both my kids use the aveeno baby eczema lotion and we have had no problems. So, I bought this product thinking it would be good for my children's skin and I was in a hurry and didn't research. Wrong! They immediately broke out with patches of eczema where I applied it. Upon doing research online I saw that it contained avobenzone and oxybenzone which can cause reactions in skin. Why would this be marketed as mild as water right on the front Now I feel like a bad mom for not doing the research and I am disappointed in a label I trusted."
"Wouldn't Recommend For Babies With Sensitive Skin Have used this several times on my 7 month old, and every time he breaks out with a pimply rash (doesn't matter where I used it, ie back, neck, arms, legs and face have all broke out). I agree with a previous poster though I've used the Aveeno Eczema lotion without issue. Wouldn't recommend this sunscreen for babies with sensitive skin."
Love Other Aveeno Products My 11 month old son broke out in a terrible rash after applying this lotion. We use the Aveeno baby eczema lotion daily without issue. I don't know what is in this product that would have caused this reaction.
"Not Good For Eczema Prone Skin I tried this stuff for my 18-month old who has very dry and eczema preone skin. It was recommended on a website for sensitive skin, but I do NOT recommend using it. She broke out in small dots/pimples a few hours after using this product. The following day it was more of a rash. Still looking for something more mild."
"Horrible For Acne Prone Or Sensitive Skin!! I've struggled with my acne for over 11 years now and I am very picky about what I put on my skin. Finally after years of effort, my face has finally cleared up over the past few months. I applied the most minute amount of this to my face yesterday before I went for a run and now I'm having the worst break out I've had in YEARS. This is not safe for use on the face if you have acne prone or sensitive skin. I've used it in the past on my shoulders and arms and it worked fine so I figured it would be okay to use on my face. Boy, was I wrong. I know everyone has different reactions, but I would not recommended this product."
"What A Mess I started to apply it on my little one and she rubbed her eyes, immediately they started tearing and she began crying. I also noticed that it started flaking off around her face and neck.Like the other guy said look like a bunch of lint. we went simming and after 40min dryed her off and reapplyed shortly after being back in the water the sun screen started dripping down her face and just running off her like water. I will never use this again. Not what I expected form Aveeno. I love there baby body wash and baby lotion they are usually very good. Don't put your baby through the tears."
"Very easy to apply I have been using this for 15+ years. It has given my face a smooth look. Really, really love this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Not a good base for makeup! While this product probably does leave faces feeling nourished, I would not recommend using it as a daily moisturizer under makeup. It left my face full of crumbles as soon as I brushed on my makeup. Would probably be better as a night cream."
Another must! The deep hydration regenerating cream works well with the deep pore scrub. Keeps my face soft and smooth. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Hurt my skin I just used this sunblock last weekend on both my children and myself. My kids are fine but my skin is red, raw and covered in hives. It hurts terribly and also itches. I am now on allergy medicine and a steroid. I am really upset about this and would not recommend this product to anyone. I am fair skinned but I have never had any bad reaction to sunblock before."
Love other Aveeno products My 11 month old son broke out in a terrible rash after applying this lotion. We use the Aveeno baby eczema lotion daily without issue. I don't know what is in this product that would have caused this reaction.

It burns my son's skin How can a product made for babies can be so uncomfortable and harmful just after you apply it burns your skin!!!! Aveeno should review the ingredients on this product.
"burns every time I put it on I bought this to use myself as a daily moisturizer, thinking it would be gentler and more hydrating than the adult version. Every time I put it on my face burns. I've never experienced this with any other product. Why does it burn???"

I will never buy this again. I applied this twice to my son while we were only outside for 40 minutes and he got burnt anyways. You could see it melting off of him. It's thick and sticky. It feels really greasy. It doesn't spread well. Really mad I wasted my money on this.
"this product keeps my face hydrated I can always count on this product, to keep my skin hydrated throughout the day, love all your products.. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Absolute garbage. I wish I could give this 1 star. This sunscreen has now caused 2 total meltdowns with my toddler after he rubbed his eyes and got it in there (I should have learned the first time). We just left the park after a 45 minute crying fit that had to involve a police officer that was standing by to help watch my running car as I tried in vain to wash it out of his eyes in a water fountain. Absolute garbage.
be careful baby is allergic.
"Disappointed Bought the sunscreen. Didn't like it. Baby's skin does not absorb it, also I wish I had checked the ingredients before ordering.. it's not very children friendly"
One Star i don't like it.
"NOT TEARLESS I literally have no idea why a product for babies and children would not be tearless.I have sworn by Aveeno products for years for both of my children's eczema. But within 20 minutes of application, and for hours after, both my 3 year old and 3 month old were screaming over this spf getting in there eyes. Frankly, I'm pissed.

One Star Really stings eyes. Wouldn't use on babySmears on car any glass difficult to get off
One Star 2 out of 6 sleeve had tears in them :(
"Aveenos WORST baby product! We used this product last summer while on vacation for the beach. My daughter played in sand, and was in salty and chlorinated water all week. When her eczema flared up worse than ever we assumed it was the hot humid weather coupled with the sand and water that was irritating her skin. Even after our trip and continuing to limit sun exposure, her skins condition never fully healed until fall.This summer I used the same product and the first day I used it, she was broken out. Convinced it was the sunblock causing this problem I switched her to Babyganics and VIOLA! Her skin is baby soft and totally 100 eczema free!She still has flare ups when exposed to sand and chlorine water, but they are mild and we still use Aveenos other baby eczema products to help combat it."
"Avoid!!!! This product has harsh chemicals ... Avoid !!!!This product has harsh chemicals in it, I can't believe they would market this for kids."
Parabens in ingredients - not natural It claims to be natural on Amazon - I was searching specifically for healthier sun screen for my little cousins.This one has parabens in it. Please be aware
deeply penetrating moisturizer I love the way this awesome moisturizer immediately soaks into my skin starting with the first treatment This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Terrible Label states mild as water which is untrue. After applying this sunscreen on my 11 month old he was crying, the area around his lips was red, and he had red bumps on his back. I immediately put him in the bath and washed this trash off of him.After visiting the Aveeno website I saw a 2 1/2 star rating for this product along with horror stories of this product causing severe reactions.I would not recommend this product and I plan on calling Aveeno."
I bought this thinking it would be fine but she had a horrible reaction to it My daughter had ezcema has a young baby but it has been cleared up for many months now. My daughter is now 10 months and hasn't had any problems with honest sunscreen or other natural kinds. I bought this thinking it would be fine but she had a horrible reaction to it! I have now thrown out the bottle.
"Too watery When we opened it is not solid, it is completely melt and pour like water.All the liquid fall in one go.My recommendation never buy online sun creams."
"Burns/Stings - Disappointing Aveeno Product I bought the Aveeno sunscreen for my toddler son since we use their baby soap and lotion and have been impressed with the products on his sensitive skin. However, the sunscreen is not like their other products! We used it on him everyday for two weeks at the beach. He would always fight us when we put it on and then scream when we gave him a shower. We thought he was just being difficult until I tried some on my face and got my face wet in the pool and it BURNS and stings! It was a firey sensation on both my face and my eyes. Even when we put it on him and let it sit for 30 min before getting wet, we could visibly see the sunscreen washing off, thus getting into the eyes. I have never seen a waterproof/resistant sunscreen coming off in the water like this. I haven't written a product review before mostly because nothing has been so bad that makes me want to spend the time to write a review but this is a must skip sunscreen! I'm looking for a new sunscreen for him now."
Not for us My son's eyes swelled up and watered and skin broke out in a rash unlike when we use Thinkbaby.
"Not formulated specially for a child - do not use on young children When I used this product on my child she broke out into hives everywhere it touched her skinand she was crying in pain. It was a very tense half hour where we had to work to wash off this waterproof product. After this happened my sister-in-law immediately asked what we had used and she said her daughter had experience the same reaction to this product from Aveeno. The claim that this is as gentle as water is a complete fabrication - we use so many Aveeno products in our home because of skin sensitivities and I was very let down by this product and upset I had relied on this company I trusted to tell us the truth that this was specifically formulated for babies. After this happened I compared the ingredients to my own sunscreen and found all of the active ingredients were the same as my own, adult, sunscreen from another company. We have since switched to the Honest Company 100 zinc oxide sunscreen."
I love all your other products but not this one I bought this product as I trusted Aveeno as a brand. But the sun cream has accidentally got into my babies eyes and she was sore for hours. And I also have just linked the sun cream to her ezcema and a rash all over her legs and her face. Won't be using this again. Sorry Aveeno! I love all your other products but not this one!
One Star Horrible product!!!! You and your child will get burnt!!
Do not use on sensitive skin Used this product on my one year old who has fair skin. He developed eczema in all his creases/joints. Do not use this product on your baby if they have sensitive or eczema prone skin. For the same amount of money (14 Canadian) you can go online and buy a much better product. Do your research!
"Gave baby rash, both of us blister like bumps on hands and feet. I bought this thinking aveeno was a gentle brand. After first use baby had rash and enough big spots that daycare refused to take her until I saw a doctor because they thought she had chicken pox. I wasn't completely sure it was the sunscreen until the next weekend when I used it on myself because I found myself outside in full sun one afternoon and that's all I had with me, now I have the same bumps on my hands...I will be throwing this out! I'd rather use my own sunscreen on baby than this horrible baby product."
skin feels hydrated Love this stuff....it feels good and works. I makes my skin tone more even and keeps me fresh all day. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Not happy I order sunblock not sunscreen I can buy sunscreen anywhere. I been looking for sunblock in many stores and I couldn't find it. that why I try online and I received sunscreen . Not fair
"Rash, burned eyes Took our young daughter to the ballpark, applied to face, arms, and legs per directions. The first thing that happened is the lotion melted in the sun, and dripped down her face burning her eyes. She was miserable. Then she developed a rash on her face and arms. The day out was cut short so we could rush home and wash the stuff off of her."
"horrible product. so i purchased this product to use on my face (not paying attention to the ingredients) because most sunscreens make my face burn (not like sunburn, like chemical sensitive skin burn). my face starting stinging sooo badly right after application! i looked at the ingredients... oxobenzene. there's no way i would put this on a baby! for the same price you can find a nice organic sunscreen"
"Crazy awful! My son has two bloodshot eyes and was in agony moments ago. Avoid this, it is not mild as water, as the package states. It was actually worrying how swollen his eyes were. I'm a sad momma!"
"Caused horrible rash on my son's back This sunscreen smells great and feels creamy, but caused a horrible rash on my son's back. Since it was Aveeno, I figured that he must be sensitive to pool water, or something else, but I read other reviews here, and discontinued it. As soon as I did, the rash cleared up. I would highly recommend mustela or baby organics sunscreen instead."
"check the expire date when you receive the items i bought the aveeno baby sunblock on July of 2012, after i received it, i did not check the expire date, i assume it will be good for at least a year. but when i paid attention to it today, i found the expire date is december of 2012. I am not happy to buy stuff with such short period of good-to-use time."
"Parabens I was going through baby sunscreens on the shelf, checking ingredients and discovered that Aveeno Baby sunscreen contained Ethylparaben and Methylparaben. I avoided purchasing this product all together. Aveeno Sun Natural Protection Baby SPF 50 Stick, 0.5 Ounce might be a better choice and is included in the Environmental Working Group's Best Sunscreen list. ..."
"Caused rash and eczema I have 15 month old twins with pasty white skin. They need sunscreen to protect them daily during the summer. I used this sunscreen for approx. 2 weeks before I started noticing eczema on both of their faces, arms and legs. The last time I used it, it caused a red, raised bumpy rash on my one girl's legs. I stopped using it once I put two and two together and have switched to a hypo-allergenic brand that seems to be working well."
"Contains oxybenzone This contains oxybenzone - what more do you need to know There are a lot of other sunscreens on the market that are safe, including other Aveeno products. There is no need to buy this one."
"NOT for sensitive skin Coppertone gave my 21 month old son a rash so I went to the store looking for something designed for sensitive skin. This product seemed to fit the bill. I applied it to my son's chest, back and arms then spent about an hour in the sun. That evening the entire area where I had applied this product was broken out in HIVES. This product is NOT for sensitive skin. After doing some research I found that it had made the EWG's Hall of Shame for bad sunscreens:..."
"thank you I thank you for this lovely product It is easy to apply, smooths on quickly and goes directly to work. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"NOT safe for baby! My 20 month old broke out in a rash all over her beautiful face after using this sunscreen! Needless to say, I checked the sunscreen on the Environmental Working Group and it made the HALL OF SHAME!!! As did a couple of other baby friendly sunscreens. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!! ..."
My Kid hates it....so Mommy hates it It stings the eyes..and my son even got rash on his cheeks...! I feel so bad having put him through this. Will never ever buy this again ..!!
toxic stuff contains OXYBENZONE
"Very disappointed! The lotion was not the quality that I have come to expect from Aveeno. Bought 2 bottles and in both the lotion was separated and no mater how much we would try to get it to mix, it wouldn't. During the time that we had it, it was never exposed to extreme temperatures. We went ahead and tried to use and it caused a rash on my daughter's face. We had ordered this about 1 month prior to needing to use it and by the time we realized the quality of the product, Amazon would not accept a return...."
"Please do not use this product on your baby!!!! I bought this product for my son, 8 year old. He plays soccer and I want make sure he is protect from sunburn. However, every time I put on him this sunscreen, he was complaining of burning and uncomfortable feeling on his skin. I really though that he was just finding an excuse to not use the cream. Then, I started to use myself and I put on my arms and notice that it really BURNS!!! I felt sorry for my son to be persistent about using this product. It is very harmful and TERRIBLE because it is made for BABYS!!! Babies does not speak, they just cry...I really hope that other parents watch out for this product."
Not very good. I purchased it at target and I was really disappointed because I really love aveeno products. The product has a tendency to separate and it ends up like clumpy chalk and oily residue.And if you use too much its clumps up on your skin and leave a weird grainy texture on you.
Parabens! And they said mild as water. Don't make me laugh. I can't wait to put all these carcinogenic parabens on my baby's skin.
"Smells like GASOLINE. Threw it away! I love Aveeno's lotions, shampoos, and body washes for adults, and I trusted their brand name, so I gave this sunblock a try for my toddler. Before I put it on him, though, I tested it myself, and I am SO GLAD I did. I used it on my face, and people, it STINKS. It smells like you got a splash of gasoline on you at the gas station, and when it's rubbed into your face so that you can't get away from it -- ugh, nauseating! I understand that it is unscented, but the ingredients in it smell like gasoline to me. Even after testing it, though, I was still willing to consider MAYBE using it for my boy, because again, I trusted Aveeno, and I know that different lotions smell different to different people. But then, my husband used it before he mowed the lawn one day, and he came back to me, UNSOLICITED, and said, and I quote, That stuff smells terrible! It smells like gasoline! I couldn't believe it. I had never asked him what he thought, or mentioned to him that that's exactly the same impression I had had! So that settled it: I tossed the barely-used tube into the trash. Before you buy this product, try taking a whiff of it at your local grocery or drug store. If you can smell that gasoline smell at all, don't buy it, because the effect will be intensified once it's on your face (or your poor baby's face!)."
"Burning eyes Crying baby We purchased Aveeno Baby Sunblock thinking it would be good for our baby since we use their lotion and bath products. That being said--when we first put it on my son, he started blinking, rubbing his eyes and crying. His eyes started turning red and he was super fussy (not typical).We thought maybe he got some in his eyes (as in larger amounts) so we tried again and same thing happened--he hated it and his eyes turned red and he kept rubbing them.We will no longer be using this on my son--I will however, use it for myself since it doesn't seem to bother my skin (I'll use on my shoulders/arms)."
"Contains 3 kinds of parabens I ordered this without looking at the ingredients (I know). And after I received it, even started using it. It has a really nice consistency and then discovered why. It has 3 kinds of parabens. Parabens have been linked to both breast cancer and endocrine disruption. While Aveeno might say the science is not all in - why take the risk I'd rather choose a product that doesn't have that potential danger. I found the Babyganics sunscreens Babyganics Cover Up Baby Sunscreen For Face and Body 50 SPF, 6-Ounce (Pack of 2) that you can also sign up for the subscription for without parabens. They are on the list of the cosmetic database/Skin deep's list of safe sunscreens. ..."
Love This Product This is a Great product and at a Great price! Will not use anything else but this line of products!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Horrible smell and stings/burns I generally really like Aveeno products but I was incredibly disappointed with this one. I bought it as a high SPF product to apply to my face this summer. I had no intention of using it on a baby, but after using this product I would be so upset if I had put it on my children. The product has a horrible smell, like burnt tires, and it stings/burns like crazy when applying. I am not just talking about getting it in the eye area. If you put it on your face, your skin feels like it is on fire! Will never purchase this one again. Maybe it is a bad batch, but be wary of this product!"
"LIKE JALAPENO IN THE EYES! It feels like you have just rubbed an open jalapeno in your eyes if you get this stuff in them. MOMS BEWARE!!!!! I tested it when it got in my daughter's eyes so I would know the severity of the situation and it was shocking, disturbing and frankly just WRONG on their part to produce a product this aggressively irritating and label it for babies. Babies rub their eyes when they are tired!!DON'T BUY IT!!!!!! Buy Ban Bt Tear Free or another tear free brand."
So Far So Good just start to use couple months ago....so far its good and statisfied......still using it for my baby and for myself too......lets see how it works....good luck
"Not Good For Long-term Use I bought Aveeno Baby sunscreen to use on my son who is prone to eczema. When I used this product occasionally at home, his skin did not seem to break out unusually. However after using this for a week straight at the beach, he had patches of eczema all over his arms and legs. The skin on his entire body felt dried out. While it provides an adequate sunscreen, I cannot recommend this product for everyday use due to the reaction my son had."

"Do not use on babies face I generally LOVE Aveeno products but this one falls short. Babies and toddlers are active, and they rub their eyes, and they cry. This sunscreen, if it gets into their eyes, will have you feeling like the worst parent in the world. My baby girl looked like she was in so much pain when she rubbed her face after I applied sunscreen. She looked so bad that it actually caused an argument with my husband on how I was so terrible at sunscreen application (how could I not be more careful to not get it in her eyes!)."
Got in my babies eye and his eyes were watering ... Got in my babies eye and his eyes were watering all day and very red. I felt awful. I thought because it was baby sunscreen I could use it on his face too...
"not safe for my kids. My kids had a reaction to eat. Specially my 18 months old baby, who got a rash and eventually a dry skin peeling. We have been using aveeno products for years, and this is the first time we had any problem with it."
"He continued with red and painful eyes even 30 min after I washed it off I applied to my 18month old 20min before getting in the pool. It applied smoothly and didnt leave him looking white. However, as soon as he got in the water it ran into his eyes and he screamed and began rubbing his eyes. He continued with red and painful eyes even 30 min after I washed it off. Caution with little ones eyes."
Greatest product ever! I recommend this to everyone I know regardless of age. It is an incredible product that actually works. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Stings toddler's eyes My 2 year old daughter cried with red eyes every time after I put it on her face because she rubbed it into her eyes.
Not a huge fan of this sunscreen. It has ... Not a huge fan of this sunscreen. It has a slick feeling when it gets wet and it stung my eyes.
What a waste. Get something that is waterproof I thought this was working okay until I noticed my daughter was getting tan even when we put it on. I noticed today it rinses right off as soon as we hit the water. What a waste. Get something that is waterproof.Also I just heard the news on cancer associated parabens. Better be safe and use something without them.
Two Stars too oil
"Two Stars My toddler, with not so sensitive skin, broke out from this sunscreen."
gross Ugh it Pills up!!!
"misrepresented This product is misrepresented when reading the product details. I bought it because it specifically says sunBLOCK. It is not sunblock though it is sunscreen. There is a difference. Sunblock blocks 100 of the uv rays where as sunscreen only filters out some of them. I would not have bothered to buy this product if the title and product detail hadn't stated SUNBLOCK. With that said I gave two stars because I am using the product on my face and it works alright. However as my daughter is a newborn they recommend sunblock so i have not put it on her, I had to purchase sunblock."
not good I bought this as it was rated very well but my son's face burned. I even put it on a 1/2 hour before being exposed to the sun and reapplied throughout the day.
"not for sensitive skin My sister bought this because her skin is very very sensitive, even many sunblocks that claim to be organic irritate her skin. She usually buys baby sunblock in order to deal with her skin. Compared to the normal aveeno sunblock, also with 55 spf, the only difference is the smell. The baby sunblock has no smell. However, my sister DID end up being allergic to it even though it says 'gentle as water'. This isn't a big deal to the two of us being that I just took it off her hands and use it as a normal sunblock, but I would NOT rub this on a baby. My sister got totally red from it. Super disappointed here, because she can't find a sunblock that works for her and she burns easily.. but I can't say it doesn't work for normal skin being that I've used it and it does work just fine for me."
Bad on the eyes Got this for the little man since he doesn't seem to have reactions to their other products. While he doesn't have a skin reaction and it did keep him from getting a sun burn it does destroy his eyes. We have tried to keep it away from his eys but I guess when he rubs his face he gets it in there. No matter what we have tried his eyes always get puffy and red. I would highly suggest looking elsewhere for lotion.
This product is the best This product is good for my sencity skin. It help me a lot is the only one who my my dry skin nice . This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"No thank you! Yuck! Very hard to spread and rub in. We used the Aveeno Face (for adults) and it rubbed in beautifully--this one, not so much. Will not buy again or recommend to anyone."
"Nice But Not Waterproof At All I like this sunscreen for my baby--it rubs completely into his skin and is non greasy. I even use it on myself, and I've never had a burn with it. However, when I applied it on my daughters and they got wet (one trip through the sprinkler), the sunscreen started to drip off them (it had been completely rubbed into their skin and not visible at all beforehand). I didn't expect it to stand up to swimming or anything, but I was surprised that it wouldn't withstand even the slightest bit of water on their skin."
So Far So Good I have used it for my son for some time. And he does not have any problem with it.

"Works well We love the baby Aveeno eczema lotion and I wanted to love the sunscreen as well. While the sunscreen did provide protection from the sun, as it should, the application is a bit thick and I'm not sure about others, but our lotion had a bit of a smell to it. It was not a pleasant smell, but it did eventually go away within 20 minutes of application. I should also note that the sunscreen did not affect my daughter's sensitive skin/eczema which is great because a different sunscreen we tried made her eczema worse, this one did not and that's why we will continue to buy even though the initial smell at application is less than pleasant."
"Mixed results I am forever trying to find a sunscreen for the family that is safe to use, but actually affordable. This one is kinda safe (safer than most in the price range), and mostly affordable. However, we have had mixed results when using.My children use it frequently, and seem to do alright with it. It protects from burns, doesn't smell weird, doesn't burn eyes (too much), and washes off fairly well, but not too well. However, when I use it on my face, it gives me a rash that lasts for days. It's only a mild rash, and better than a sunburn by far, but still, not so great. My husband sweats it off, but he does that with everything anyway. Overall, it's better than nothing, and works well enough to keep around until something better comes along."
sunburn and stinging eyes I've used this on two different occasions. Once on vacation in the Caribbean and the kids both got a little burned and they HATED that it ran into their eyes. The second time it was in the midwest. Still hot and sunny and on the beach but probably less direct sun and the children did not get burned. I would use at home until it runs out but I don't think I would buy again.

"My Go-to Product My daughter in law keeps this in her diaper bag, now, being the grandma with the pool, I keep some here now too. I'll admit I haven't compared it to any other, but it works well."
"Great! It's good product, I recommended!"
"Trusted! I only use this sunscreen on my daughter. I love Aveeno products so it gets an A+ from me. When it comes to my daughter I only use the best on her and since Aveeno is so trusted I have no worries there. Its not greasy, easy to blend it. Perfect."

Four Stars I like the product of aveeno
Four Stars Great product
Not for me Just didn't have the moisture I am used too. Thought I would try this but will go back to Nutragena
Amazing results I am a licensed aesthetician and have used medical grade products. My mother got me using this and it is an outstanding product This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Good product Great for the summer and not too oily or heavy.
Four Stars Seems to work but I bought another brand after realizing this may not be tear free.
"Smells great! I love the smell of this sunscreen!! I keep my baby shaded, so this is a double precaution, but he hasn't gotten any sun that I can see."
"the sunscreeny smell isn't as strong as most sunscreens and it goes on very easily. Will definitely continue to purchase I use it daily, the sunscreeny smell isn't as strong as most sunscreens and it goes on very easily. Will definitely continue to purchase."

I started using this on my now 3 year old daughter when she was only a year and a half old, she has a slightly sensitive skin and this worked well for her no reaction at all. Four star because it's a little thick and hard to spread but nothing too much to a point that it bothers her."
Four Stars good sun protection
Four Stars better than most

Worth the price Best for weekend outings for babies kids in summer
"this product goes on easy Thought that this product was not greasy, went on smooth and made my skin feel soft. Also had a nice smell not to overpowering This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Four Stars Works well. Doesn't break out baby's skin. Only complaint is it sometimes flakes.
"Good for sensitive skin. Really thick, hoping it would be the same consistency as there other baby lotions. Most importantly it doesn't cause my baby's sensitive skin to break out. So I guess it's all works out."
"Very good, so far. Recently purchased the Aveeno Baby Sunblock, and so far so good. The application of it was fine, as it is not thick and globby like most products of it's kind.Also, the odor is generic, which I prefer, specifically for an a child, since I do not care for overly scented, high in alcohol content products for my child.Her skin was not greasy, and most importantly, she did not seem uncomfortable."
"Cakes up My daughter has eczema and is extra sensitive to even eczema specific products (broke out with babyganics eczema formula) so I was hesitant to use this on her. However it turned out to be a decent option for her sensitive skin. The 3 times I have used it so far I did not notice any rash, bumps or itching (trust me my 7 month old daughter does not hesitate to scratch if something is irritating her skin). Despite other reviews she did not scratch any once applied, my only complaint is that it clumps and cakes up whether I use a thin layer/thick layer/well rubbed in. It looks as if someone lazily put cream on her and didnt bother to rub it in.Overall a descent product, did well in water, just wish it looked better after applied."
Quite good! Aveeno products are usually reliable and trusted and we have been using it on our baby for vacations at the beach... It's pretty good!
"Worked well, a bit filmy I like, but don't love this. It is a little oily, but the issue is that it feels a little film-like once applied. i.e., it peels a little. It's also a little hard to apply very evenly on a squirmy baby.That said, it was effective, our baby didn't burn, and she had no negative reaction. The parents also used it, and it worked well."
"Four Stars we bought it having used it ,likeably, for years on a sensitive adult facial skin"
Four Stars Ok....
Four Stars Removable easily.
"Love This! I use this sunscreen on myself under makeup and could not be more pleased with the generous SPF and results. I have acne-prone, occasionally oily, sensitive skin that hates hates hates products with added fragrance. I LOVE that this sunscreen is gentle, fragrance-free, thick, smooth, and spreads easily and beautifully all over my skin as both a moisturizing base and sun protectant. It is not greasy or sticky in my opinion, but leaves a wonderfully hydrating, supple feel to my face and a nice matte finish to boot. My previous sunscreen was fine for the body, but not so great for the face--with the typically added fragrance most sunscreens contain--under my makeup. The old sunscreen burned on application and often left me with new blemishes by the end of the day when I finally removed my makeup. Before the Aveeno, I had very little hope of finding something fragrance-free that could work so well for face and body. I highly recommend this sunscreen to adults (I cannot recommend for babies and children however due to my lack of experience in that department) who are looking for the same solution to otherwise problematic sunscreens with added fragrance that more times than not presents discomfort and problematic inflammation to delicate skin."

Awesome!! Consumer reports rated this the best for babies
"Great for sensitive skin! Only use this brand on my children! Only use this sunscreen on my children, because they have sensitive skin. We have never had an issue with this one! Also the consistency is great and easy to apply. Protection is great as well!"
Five Stars Stays on and protects!
Great Product I bought this for my 6 month old baby and I'm so glad I went with this brand. My baby was in the sun quite a few times during our vacation when she was in the pool or outside of the beach tent and never got sun burned once. I applied it before we left the house so it would be absorbed before she was outside in the heat. Definitely will continue using this product.
"The Only Sunscreen My Daughter Can Handle W/o A Rash! At age 2, my daughter developed an allergy to sunscreens. We were using waterbabies for 2 years...and suddenly a rash. We were there for something else, but the dermatologist said to try aveeno baby. She is 12 and we still use it. It's the ONLY sunscreen she can handle without breaking out with a rash."
I Use This Myself I use this myself even though this is branded for babies as this sunscreen is less sticky than others I've used but not too watery at the same time.
"Saved Me From Sunscreen Allergy I get bad reactions to most adult sunscreens (I think from the titanium dioxide), so switching to this made a world of difference. It's a bit thick in consistency, however, but works really well to protect my skin and keep it rash-free."
"Really Surprised There Aren't More Positive Reviews! Only Thing That Worked For My Kids I'm honestly really surprised to see that there aren't better ratings! When my daughter was itty-bitty, we first tried another baby brand of sunscreen on her. As a toddler, we noticed that she had hives/rash on her face and other areas where the sunscreen had been. (on a couple of occasions) We finally determined that sh was reacting to something in the other sunscreen. A friend told us about Aveeno, so next time we tried the Aveeno baby sunscreen. No issues at all, no rash or hives - and it stayed on just fine (during swimming/play). We mostly use Aveeno lotion on her skin, (sometimes we use others). But there's definitely something in other sunscreens that irritates her skin. When my son came along - we only used Aveeno baby sunscreen on him and he never had issues. This past Memorial Day, we were using the Aveeno Baby sunscreen when we visited a friends lake house. After we got out of the water (day 2), I grabbed another spray sunscreen to quickly reapply on both my kids... Later that night (and next day) I noticed they both broke out again in a rash. I should've known better :( Anytime I've used this on my kids - they do great, they rarely get tan lines which tells me it's working, and just to be safe, I'll reapply some if they've been dried off, or been in the water a long time. I would def recommend this and don't plan on switching to something new"
So Soft but never greasy Love this moisturizer! I use it every day and can definitely feel a difference in my skin. Softens without any greasy feel. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Summer Must-have I can rely on this product no matter what. I feel like my kids are well covered!
Solved A Long Term Problem For Me! This is the first sunscreen I am able to use on my arms and not itch! It has been a lifesaver for me. I am an older adult and have been using this for a few years now. Thanks Aveeno!
"Must Have In Summer my baby really like this product, nice smell and the texture really nice. i am going to buy the 2nd bottle bottle for my new born babe."
"It Works If You Use It! We traveled from WI to Mexico in Feb. I used this on myself and our 2 year old son. Neither of us had any itching or rashiness. I did take an aqua class and forgot to reapply afterwards and did burn my chest, so remember to reapply. Otherwise it is great and I will buy it again to use during the summer."
"Great! Goes on easy, stays on long! You can't go wrong with this product!!!"
Good All Over And All-day Protection. This goes on smoothly and does not flake. My skin does not have that ashen/gray look. Mixes well with my body lotion. No overwhelming scent. I love this natural product. I prefer this to just about every other sun protection.
"Amazingness! This sunscreen is awesome, it prevents sunburn, and it feels incredibly light on my skin, it doesn't feel greasy!"
Great For Sun Sensitive Skin I burn easily and this product provided long lasting protection. Lasts all day
"The Only One I Use On My Face I have very light skin, and this is the only sunblock that works long enough to stay out all day!"
"Excellent Sunblock This sunblock is, hands down, my favorite sunblock ever. It was never irritating to my eczema prone skin. Even though they have a formulation specifically for the face, I opted to use this one for my face as well. I had no issues with subsequent blocked pores or acne. It has a wonderful scent. It's my sunblock of choice. If they'd just sell it in a 3 pack like Neutrogena at Costco, it would be perfect."

"Easy to apply This sunscreen is easy to apply and seems to work well. It doesn't have added scent, which I like."
Love this Product I love the way Olay's Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream makes my skin feel. In fact my whole family uses it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Sunscreen is excellent for sensitive skin Sunscreen is excellent for sensitive skin. My son breaks out on every other sunscreen product on his face, but this sunscreen hasn't caused any break outs for the past 2 years we've been using it."
Five Stars good
"Easy to apply, not greasy, no overpowering smell. No complaints! This spreads smoothly into baby's skin without making her too greasy or sticky and doesn't have a strong smell at all. I'm sure she ingested a little from biting her feet/hands, and there wasn't any issue. No skin problems, pimples, or rashes from using this. And most importantly: no sunburns!"
Five Stars OK
Five Stars No bad smell
"Well, I don't get sunburns when I use it! I'm definitely a fan. It's a bit less greasy than other sunblocks, and certainly seems to work while I'm out on the beach or going for a run. Follow the directions, reapply when needed, and you'll be fine."
"Best Kids Sunscreen! Only sunscreen I will ever use! My daughter has very sensitive skin, and i have never had a problem with this. Protects skin great!"
"great for kids with fair and sensitive skin My daughter have very fair and sensitive skin. We have used this brand of sunscreen and have not burned yet! We are out all summer long, in and out of the water, and it has worked for us. The entire bottle has lasted us almost all summer and we used it almost daily and multiple times a day!"
Five Stars it is good.
... once so far and it seems to do a fine job. Doesn't smell chemically - used it only once so far and it seems to do a fine job.

We keep several tubes on hand because we like it so much Protected my tiny human well while we were at the water amusement parks in the middle of summer. We keep several tubes on hand because we like it so much.
Five Stars Good for the kids skin and blocks the sun well
Five Stars Aveeno baby sunblock is a superior product!
Five Stars good
"Worked like a charm I used this on my less than 1-year-old, red-haired, very light skinned baby girl. We used it at Myrtle Beach, the state fair and other very sunny places in the summer (while also limiting her time in the sun and keeping her as covered up as possible). However she NEVER got slightly burned once. I lathered her up pretty good and this sunscreen worked wonderfully."
"but I love it, and highly recommend for the tiny babies ... I bought this for a baby shower, and ended up using it on my own daughter. It certainly goes fast, especially in a bigger kid, but I love it, and highly recommend for the tiny babies with the virgin skin."
"Not too shabby for American sunscreen I bought this upon recommendation from a Youtube blogger. I like this product on my hands, arms and chest or legs. It dries DRY believe it or not. Is very gentle. If you sweat, it will get milky on you though. However, it is 'resistant' to sweat for the time specified. I use this mostly for when I'm outdoors gardening, or for my daily commute to work. You ARE putting sunscreen on your hands and arms every day when you drive to work right RIGHT The price cannot be beat either. No scent except for a light sunscreen smell which does dissipate after drying. Will buy again."
High quality no burn baby lotion Great sunscreen for adults too
"Its great! Except that if you use it over a ... I use this baby one because I have very sensitive skin. Its great! Except that if you use it over a couple years, it ends up getting very oily.. which is not a nice thing at all."
"Great! Used it for my husband and myself for a 4 day backpacking trip. Not greasy, no sunburns. Will buy it again."
Moisture Rich For deep penetrating long lasting hydration you can't go wrong with Olay Regenerating Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great product!! Amazing!! After researching all the different sunscreen and sunblock this is the one that kept coming up as the safest for babies. It's a good thick sunblock and it didn't come off hardly at all when he was in his little pool!! I got sunburnt but he wasn't even red!
Five Stars Love the aveeno products.
Great for sensitive skin! My boy has always had sensitive skin so we've been big fans of aveeno lotions and this sunscreen doesn't disappoint!
Five Stars So far great for my toddler who has eczema.
Great for white areas on dogs! Using for dog nose (white) at high altitude. Works great! Never used on baby...
Five Stars Very sensitive to skin
"The ONLY kind we use at our house!! Great price with subscribe and save. This is the only sunscreen I have ever used on my daughter (she's 2) -- and it's now the only sunscreen my husband and I use too! Even my husband said the other day, Wow -- I really like this stuff.' and he HATES sunscreen!Here is why I love it so much:1. Rubs in SO easy. You barely have to rub it -- which any parent knows is awesome for wiggly toddlers.2. It's not greasy like other sunscreens. That's the reason my husband hates sunscreen. This one is not like that at all. Leaves your face feeling like you just put moisturizer on.3. It's gentle and has never irritated my daughter's skin -- from 9 months old on. Why would I ever use anything else if this is working so wellGreat stuff -- we have it on our Subscribe Save and love the price this way!!"
"My favorite baby sunscreen My favorite baby sunscreen! Not greasy, and it rubs into her skin well. I also love the smell of it."
"Best and safest baby sunblock! This is the best and safest baby sunblock I have ever purchased. I also use it on me sometimes (and I'm certainly not a baby). I've recommended it to all my parent friends as well. It does get a bit greasy in baby's hair, but it's totally worth it for the level of protection it offers. It's well-absorbed into the skin and doesn't leave a gross film on the skin like other sunblock brands."
Five Stars Great price.
"simple, to the point good overall cream to use for just about all the issues you can have, no horrible after smell, smooth absorbs quickly This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Very Good Sunscreen! I purchased this product because it is gentle on the skin. I use it on my face because of how gentle it is.
"Great for sensitive skin (baby or adult) I am an adult, but burn like a baby. Most products make my skin break out or give me rashes. Regular Aveeno has been good to me in the past, but still a little sensitive on my face. This left me fully protected and without the greasy coating or breakouts. Love it. 5 stars. Will buy again."
"Five Stars Worked great, easy to apply. No reaction on baby skin !"
Five Stars Love this product.
Five Stars this is the only sunscreen I've found that doesn't give me a rash
Recommended by my oncological dermatologist. Recently recommended by my oncological dermatologist. I am in my late 60's and have had various skin cancers removed over the last few years. I was frequently exposed to the sun during my childhood here in Southern California and am now paying the price. This sun protection is NOT just for babies.
GOOD Good product Authenticity Guarantee GOODGood productAuthenticity Guarantee
"Aveeno Sun Burn if you use Aveeno Sunscreen! Aveeno Baby Sunscreen Lotion prevented my child from becoming burned by the sun! We use this every time our child comes near the sun for prolonged periods of time and have had no issues!This product works so well that it might also be useful for vampires who want to experience the joys of the sun again without being turned into a ruined husk of a creature! I am not a vampire myself, so please consult with your physician before attempting any day walking."
Would recommend. Had no choice but to put some on my 4 1/2 month old. She did not react and did not burn at all. No skin irritations whatsoever. Would recommend!
I recommend this for babies! Works really great. I had my 6 month old in the pool and she didn't get burned at all. It didn't run off into her eyes when her face got wet. It works really well.
Nice GreatGreatmefeels great smells great succulent took away dry skin silky smooth enriching
Great Moisturing effects! Really liked this cream very much. It really restored moisture to my skin which gave a much brighter look. Thank you. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great sunscreen Great sunscreen. Not greasy, and does not smell bad. Would definitely purchase again."
Five Stars No Issues!! prompt delivery. Use it everyday
Perfect for sensitive skin We use this on our 1 year old's body and it works perfectly. She has never had a sunburn and it has never created skin problems for her sensitive skin. We love it!
Five Stars Like it very much
"Recommend I really like this product because it feels more like you've applied lotion rather than a sticky, smelly sunscreen. It's a great consistency for applying to babies/toddlers--thick enough that you won't drop it all over while they're wiggling around--so I feel like I do a better job of getting even coverage. The subscribe-and-save price is much better than buying from the store where I'm at. Definitely recommend!"
Five Stars Great
Five Stars This works perfect for my babies! Other sunblock irritates my kids skin!
Five Stars good
great for sensitive skin. Excellent sunscreen. I feel comfortable rubbing this into my sensitive babies skin. Has done great for us so far. It may not be the 'cleanest' sunscreen out there ... but it is one of the better ones in its price range. I also like using this on my face and my older kids faces.
"Five Stars Very nice sunscreen and makes my face seem soft, even minimizes my fine lines in my face."
"Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream Love it, love it, I am 61 years young, with No wrinkles..... LOVE IT, LOVE IT, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE.... This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Works Great! We were in Florida at the beach and Disney World for about 10 days with our 10 month old and I was so worried about her getting sunburned! Even in the Florida sun (and her being crazy pale just like me) all we needed was to apply this stuff once in the morning and we could walk around Disney World all day in the sun (for like 12 hours) and she never got a sunburn!
Five Stars Good product
"Great for babies with sensitive skin This sunscreen works great on my sensitive baby's skin. I have tried other sunscreens and they were either too greasy or didn't protect her well enough. This sunscreen lasted us all day long, even with her playing in the water. It rubbed in easily, with no greasy residue or powdery flakes. My baby has sensitive skin and can get a rash easily if we don't use the right products, but her skin did not react to this at all. I will definitely be buying this sunscreen for her again and from now on. I would recommend this to everyone with kids or people who have sensitive skin!"
Five Stars It's OK
Five Stars Awesome stuff
"very gentle! my little one has very sensitive skin, so I was nervous about using any sunscreen on her at all. this reads that it is as gentle as water so that convinced me....so far so good. I have used it several times and it has not bothered my lo's skin at all. :) and she has also stayed sunburn free :)"
"Five Stars Great sunblock for tiny humans, or even sensitive skin adults."
Five Stars Great product
works well for us Sensitive skin kids have not burned or broken out so I'm happy
Five Stars My granddaughter uses this regularly and it is wonderful for sensitive skin.

"My new go-to sunscreen!! I have very sensitive, dry skin, and was going on a Caribbean vacation as well as a vacation to Southern California this summer. This sunscreen was a lifesaver for me. It kept my skin hydrated, but absorbed quickly and didn't leave a greasy feeling or make my skin look oiled. It protected me from sunburn for even longer than expected, has an inoffensive smell that fades quickly, and didn't irritate my skin or cause any rashes/breakouts. I can't say enough good things about this stuff!"
We have tried a few sunscreens and I like Aveeno products and this was a win for us We have tried a few sunscreens and I like Aveeno products and this was a win for us. It doesn't have a strong smell and it doesn't bother my daughter's eyes as much as another sunscreen did

"Great product My child has some allergies and this is the only sunblock that we can use! Doesn't upset the skin and does a good job blocking the sun, what more can I say."
Five Stars Nice
Five Stars Great sunscreen by a trusted brand. I would buy it again.
"Great for sensitive skin! This product always gets the job done! My son has eczema and his skin has always been so sensitive to most lotions, but I can slather a lot of this on him and it has always protected his skin from the sun without him breaking out in a rash or it burning his skin."
Five Stars Gets the job done and smells great.
Five Stars A good lotion for my daughter.
great sunscreen I love this lotion. It is very thick but goes on fast and smooth. My baby loves it and so does my 11 year old. Worth the money

"love it! I purchased this Aveeno Baby sunblock for my grandson. I love the fact that it is a sunblock with a SPF of 55. I feel confident that my grandson can be out in the sunshine and play, getting some fresh air, all while being protected from the sun. Plus, it smells great!"

"Love it! Received this in time for beach vacation. I always get sun poisoning and did some research on how to prevent it. Aveeno Baby was on the top of the list for protection for both UVA UVB sun rays. Most only protect from UVA. 2 weeks later, lots of sunshine no poison. I am sold!"
Very good! The product is exelent and the price is very good. This is the second time we order it through Amazon and we are very pleased.
Five Stars Great product
"I love Aveeno products and this is no different I love Aveeno products and this is no different. Its a good sun block that I use on my 19 month old...and sometimes on myself..:). Its light and waterproof and gives protection for 50 whole mins..Aveeno Baby Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 55, 4 Ounce"
Five Stars Always love Aveeno products! Can't go wrong and I always find it cheaper here
Works well for adults too! Good product
Love this sunscreen! rubs on skin well.
"Great Sunblock for baby I will always love Aveeno products. This is my first Aveeno Baby product and I have to say that I was surprised that the Baby products were just as good. I was expecting this lotion to be thick and strong scented like other sun protectants for babies, but this one was pleasant smelling and absorbed very quickly into baby's skin. The 4 ounces lasted the duration of summer and gave compactness that us mothers desperately look for."
I love that it has no fragrance. My skin needs extra hydration because I work inside an aircraft where there is 0 humidity. My skin soaks up the moisture from this product This review was collected as part of a promotion.
You get what you order Exactly what we needed for cheaper than our local stores
"Gentle, non-irritating sunblock great for sensitive skin. Not just for babies! Massage it in and the white goes away, not that it matters. It's for protecting your skin! It has no smell and is gentle and non-irritating on my skin that is sensitive to everything. This is the second time I bought it from Amazon. Will keep buying as needed."
Five Stars Perfect for my son's sensitive skin.
Five Stars Good
"My favorite sunblock I love this sunblock, it doesn't feel greasy and works really well. Even though it is for babies, I use it on myself because I have sensitive skin and some sunblocks sting my eyes if I get near them. Oh, and I do use it on the baby too, I trust the Aveeno brand."
Five Stars My kids have super sensitive skin and it works for them.
Good product I purchase this because my daughter uses it all the time. Mom knows best.
no harsh smell We love Aveeno products and are completely satisfied with thr sunscreen product. I like that there wasn't a harsh smell.
"So glad I got this So glad I got this. Aveeno is one of my favorite brands and they didn't disappoint with the baby sunscreen. It has a very mild smell, but it is the normal sunscreen smell. I'd buy this again."

"Only Product that works for my sons sensitive skin. I have tried all the expensive, high end sunscreens for my sensitive skinned baby and this is the ONLY one that doesn't make him break out in rash. The Dr recommended it after we realized that all the other sunscreens I tried had Zinc in them. We thought that must be the ingredient he was allergic too not once has he ever broken out from this product. He is nearly 3 now and has been using the product for 2 years. I won't buy anything else for his skin."
"i like it very much it's the second bottle sunblock, not so much more oil .i like it very much ."
"Has made a good difference People with babies/kids don't seem to like this product but we only use it on adults and love it. My hubby has psoriasis and rosacea and with continual use of this product his skin is much, much better. Whether that's due to the product and it's ingredients or due to the protection from the sun (that could be provided by any sun screen), we don't know. But we do like that it soaks in quickly and leaves no residue and a little goes a long ways. When washing it off (usually in the shower) we always close our eyes tight and wash our faces really well because it will sting if it runs off into your eyes."
Five Stars Perfect
I love this! I love this!
This product is terrific !!! This cream is rich. It makes my sensitive skin feel moisturized without feeling greasy and no harsh products to irritate it. I Love It !!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
light weight and effective I use this when jogging in the heat of the afternoon and swimming on weekends. It is not oily and it blends in nicely on my face and other areas exposed to sunlight. I use it because I have sensitive skin. I did not have any irritation or break outs when using this product.
"Great Sunblock for WHOLE Family! This sunblock is great for all four of us! My husband and I use it some, and our 3-yr-old daughter wears it daily in the summer. And... although it's generally suggested to avoid putting sunblock on babies less than 6 months, this worked beautifully for our 5-mo-old son! Although we mostly kept him out of the sun, we didn't want to risk sun burn. He did NOT break out in any kind of rash with Aveeno Baby! Try a small area first, in case your baby doesn't react as well - but for us, it's the PERFECT sunblock."
"Best sunscreen ever! and it's SPF 55!! Just one thing that I can tell you: this one has no water-mark, so it can last longer on your face!"
"Lovely Scent Rich, creamy, spice scented (not over powering), body butter. Love this product!!!"

Pore Therapy This product works great on acne and blackheads!
"Product works great but... When I first began to use there appeared to be purple food coloring in the product, which actually turned my face purple. I shook the container and discarded what was in the reservior and the purple dye went away. Product itself works...just never had an Obagi product turn my face purple."

Not for me.. Wasted my money. Package was orange from I am not sure. Was leaking when it arrived. I think using this has also made my face break out more.
"Good, but can be drying This is a very good face wash. I wish I could use it, but even after I stopped using it, my face continued to be severely dry for awhile. It does forewarn on the back that that could happen."
This is a great product but i just bought it last week and ... This is a great product but i just bought it last week and its a dollar more already. Stridex needs to bring it back to the stores. Its too expensive on Amazon!!!
... week ago in 5 Below a very cheap and cool store. I did not buy this off of Amazon but I did buy it about a week ago in 5 Below a very cheap and cool store.
"Nice scrub, not too gritty Nice scrub, not too gritty, good acne control, can use morning night without drying out. Never was a Stridex fan before, but this product's a keeper."
"Why No Fragrance-Free Formula Today is my first time using this product. Felt great going on immediately, felt moisturized without being too greasy. Although it smells great I would have loved to have this formula in a fragrance-free option, my skin tends to be a little sensitive to fragrances, but I will give a final review in a couple of weeks"
"this product is the best! After using so many products over the years, I have finally found one that works. Thank you for coming out with this wonderful product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"An Underrated and Wonderful Product I have suffered from mild hormonal acne and sensitive skin since I was in middle school. Besides Neutrogena's Pink Grapefruit cleanser, this product has done wonders to my acne-ridden skin. It not only made most of my acne disappear within around a week of use, my skin and acne was significantly less red and painful. It's also very gentle on my skin.I know everyone's skin is different and it may not work for you, but I found this product years ago and bought it to save money. It is definitely an underrated product as it is one of my favorites to use. I highly recommend it to teenagers who deal with consistent, hormonal acne."
"great buy I've been through so many acne products it's not even funny. Finding a good acne wash seems to be the most difficult. I have oily skin so they are either too rough on my skin or they don't get rid of enough oil. However, this one is the first that so far has been gently on my skin but gets rid of a lot of blackheads and excess oil. The beads are very tiny so they do their job without damaging your skin. At the same time the aloe soothes your skin leaving it soft when dry. Over time I've found it can dry your skin out a little but no where near what other products have done. Overall I'm very happy and will be sticking with this wash for a while."
The only thing that works for my acne!!!! I absolutely love this product!! Hate that they took it out of stores!!
Five Stars Great product
"I LOVE this scrub I LOVE this scrub. The only problem is that I can't find it anywhere in the stores anymore. Thank goodness for Amazon. I hope that Stridex will be continuing making this product. It is not harsh on my face, yet dissolves dirt and oil while polishing away dead skin. The smell is fantastic and the added honey has natural antibacterial properties. Stridex...please bring this back to stores for 3.50. PLEASE!"
Five Stars Cleared up my pimples in days!
I love this face wash it gets rid of my dark ... I love this face wash it gets rid of my dark ance marks. It wasn't supposed to be here for a few weeks but the owner sent it first class.
amazing!! Best face wash ive ever used!!!
"i absolutely love love love this face wash i cannot find this in ANYYYY store now!!! it was 3 at walmart, then all of a suddem they aint got it anymore. my 'rents found it at kmart, for the same price, and now its not there either :( Nor have they been able to find it anywhere else! what happened i absolutely love love love this face wash! it is the best face wash that i have used EVER and ive used all diff kinds: i have to have this stuff!"
"Amazing!!!! I was very happy with this product. It's the only thing that worked for me. It cleared my acne away fast, and my face felt comfortable after cleansing. :)I am disappointed to not be able to buy it at Walmart in my town anymore. All they have are the pads, and I don't like them. They dry out my skin. :("
"Product is soft and not greasy. This product really works. Almost immediately noticed smoother, more even toned skin. People were also commenting my skin looked younger. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
love it this is the only product that has ever worked for me. its off the shelves in the stores. amazon is the only place i can get it
Good stuff! I have used many scrubs in the past. Decided to try this one as it was a very good price. Works very well. Be careful as it can dry out your face a bit if used too much. Best price on this type of product that I could find anywhere.
LOVE THIS. I was upset when they discontinued the Stidex Dual solutions... But this works even better. This will be my new daily facewash. Love it.
"Gentle Yet Scrubs Stridex Conditioning Acne Scrub may seem like a regular facial cleanser on the outside but it has super-fine exfoilating balls, skin-healthy vitamins and botanicals and an effective acne-fighter built in. The scrub provides deep cleansing and exfoilation for your skin that is gentle enough for daily use. It isn't rough enough that it will scratch or gouge your skin, which I mean who wants their face to look like a war zone Some of the ingrediants are:Acerola Cherry Extract - contains high level of natural vitamin C and antioxidants for healthy skin.Bergamot Citrus - a traditional treatment for acne and other skin conditions.Honey - known for its antiseptic and moisturization properties.2 salicylic acid which works as an acne buster and prevents pimples and blackheadsI wash my face twice a day but if I'm not careful I can do more damage than its worth. I have an oily forehead but a dry rest of my face, so I need something gentle but that works. Lately I have been breaking out, pretty much worse than when I was in high school! I used to use those exfoliating cleanses that have the little beads in them that really scrub your face. The problem with those though is they would irritate my face causing redness and I was afraid it was actually opening my pores to irritants. When I saw that Stridex came out with a Conditioning Acne Scrub I was intrigued. I used to use those Stridex pads to clean my face and honestly I don't know why I stopped using them.Now even though Stridex Conditioning Acne Scrub is an exfoliating cleanser, the beads are small and gentle it doesn't irritate my skin. I could feel them in there but it was more of a gentle gritty feeling. Really gentle but still scrubbing those dead cells off my face. The smell was also nice and refreshing. Usually Salicylic acid bothers me too but I it didn't with this cleanser. I really like this cleanser by Stridex and highly recommend it for anyone looking for a gentle yet effective acne scrub!I received this product to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion."
"CeraVe Healing Ointment, 5oz Winter and low humidity are tough on my hands, which results in dry, rough, and cracked skin. I will often try different products to see if it works better than the one I'm currently using. I saw CeraVe Healing Ointment on the shelf during my last visit to Wal-Mart. I hadn't seen it before so I thought I would give it a try. The product was labeled Non-Greasy Feel which was very important to me because I work in an office environment and leaving smudges on everything I touch is not good. Although CeraVe labeled their product with Non-Greasy Feel I am extremely disappointed with the amount of grease/oil that remains on my hands after applying a small amount of the ointment. For example, after applying the ointment and rubbing it into my hands as best as possible, I am unable to pick up a cup of coffee, write with a pen, or twist a door handle open an hour later. My computer keyboard and mouse, smartphone screen, and most everything else I touch is covered with the Non-Greasy ointment. In my opinion, the amount of greasiness remaining an hour after applying the ointment is not a Non-Greasy Feel and I believe the company should not advertise it as such."
"It's an over priced fair product In my opinion, it is an over priced yet fair product. I received a very small container sample in my Walmart Spring Beauty Box. Actually, I am very disappointed that such an expensive item would offer a very small amount in a sample. Another customer has posted a review on this item stating she used it for her hands and it was greasy. I don't really see this item as a hand cream/lotion/protectant and to be perfectly frank, this item doesn't really state much about what it is for....other than chafed skin. In the listing it does state something about eczema and since I have that in my eyebrows, that is where I tried the sample of this product, first. All I can say is, a vaseline gel would net me better results and a whole lot less in price. Maybe IF I had received a small tube of this to sample as was the other products included in the Sample Box, I may have been able to try it out for more days and come out with a different conclusion. All I can say is, if you want a hand cream, there are other products that are far less in price that will probably fit your needs better than this product. If you need a product for your facial area for dry skin and/or eczema, there are better products than this and less in price. If you need all over skin care for dryness/chafed skin, the old tried and true vaseline type product in a jar is much less expensive than this. This product does look and feel some what similar as a vaseline jelly in a jar. In regards to greasiness, it is greasy, not overbearing greasy unless you put a lot on but it is in fact some what greasy/oily. I worked in a hospital for many years and in healthcare....if you have much chafing or rash, try AD ointment."

"Great For Cracked Hands! I got a sample of this in my Target beauty box. I sent it to my dad immediately! My dad works in construction and his hands get so dry that they crack. When they crack they are very sore and painful. So i sent it to him to try. He totally loves it. Just after a few days of using it, he bought the full size of this. I'm so happy to have been able to receive this product and help my dad with his hands. Great job Target:)"
"Works good Was recommended by my son's pediatrician . It's not greasy once you rub it in . It feels nice when I had tried it on my skin , like silky ."
"Must have!! The only thing that will heal my dry skin and my dry knees. It is an ointment , so it is a little thicker but it's very healing."
"Great Hydration for aging skin I love this product to give my skin a soft and hydrated look. As I age, I look to the regenerist products to hold back the time clock. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smart purchase I am glad I saw this. Works well, not greasy."
"Love It! Winter (and my age) did a number on my lips - they were sooo dry. I had Vaseline on my shopping list when my Target Beauty Box arrived with a sample of this product. I used it last night on my lips and again this morning. My lips already feel so much better. While the purchase price may seem a little high, a tiny bit of this goes a long way so a 12 oz jar would last a really long time! This is one of my new favorite products!"
Nice Ointment Healed my dry under nose area after being sick.
Got This In The Target Beauty Box I just happened to have burned myself and used this on the burn. Worked well and wasn't greasy.
"Amazing Stuff! so glad I bought this on a whim..I got a sudden mysterious rash all over my body and after a few days it started to peel. After a couple showers I applied this and wow, what a difference it made. It is quite thick, less greasy for sure than other ointments but still better to wait awhile before getting dressed. I certainly plan on keeping this stocked!"
Great Healing Ointment This helped heal my cracked dry nose after excessive nose blowing from a cold. It was not super greasy like some other ointments and it did not irritate my cracked skin.
"Changed My Life!!! For 25 years my hands have cracked, bled and been incredibly painful every winter. I could hardly take care of myself or family. Tried every kind of cream and cure, even spent 2,000 on twice-weekly appointments at a dermatologist's office. This is the only thing that has ever helped, the ceramides are some kind of miracle. CeraVe is the best!"
"Love It, Multi-purpose. Super Smooth. Like Aquaphor but waaaaaay better! Great as a chapstick, post tattoo ointment, cuticles, whatever!"
"Great For My Rosacea I have Rosacea on my cheeks and have tried prescriptions, creams, and special make up. None was very effective. I received this as a sample when I purchased Cerave cleanser and began using it to soothe my inflamed cheeks. Within 3 weeks, my cheeks are smoother and significantly les red. I don't use much and am sure to rub it in really well so my face isn't greasy looking, but what a difference!"
"Bad shipping poor shipping powder arrived open, both bottles were half empty."
Non greasy-just right I love how the hydration regenerating cream is non greasy and just feels right. I must admint....I love the whole :Regenerist line. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
acceptable-- not-- exceptional... i prefer talc based products-- which this particular Anti-Monkey Butt product IS not all A-M-B products are however as some use cheaper corn starch it is ok for short term absorbent / friction reducing ability. it has no type of real medication to prevent odor or itching like some others do Desenex - talc with 2 miconizol . i'll maybe use this but will still prefer the medicated products for regular use which seem to offer superior / extra protection in a talc base.
No more sweating and itching! I heard a couple of players for The New Orleans Saints football team talking about how it had helped them. Thought I'd give it a try. Was sweating and itching at night in the groin area. I highly recommend this product. The only downside I see to it is that some of the powder is wasted during application.
Product works! It works as advertised.
"Good stuff Very good powder. Keeps dry and fresh. But, 8 bucks for 10 ozs. is on the steep side. I used a generic brand and got almost the same results at half the price. I mean it's talc."
"Works well, can't stand the fragrance. I wish it came in a fragrance free version, otherwise it works well."
Too funny for words I've purchased this product several times over the years. Mostly because it's funny. I've never actually used it. Just gave it as gifts. One of the folks has used it and thought it was great. Can't go wrong with a product called Anti Monkey Butt.
No Monkey Business! This product works! Recommend application after thoroughly drying off after bath or shower. Works great between baths or showers as needed too. Don't let the unsophisticated label deter you.
RAW BUTT RAW BUTT MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
nan
Trucker butt!!!! I bought Monkey butt powder to help relieve my trucker butt.....this stuff works great for us drivers who sit alot!!!!!
Excellent product This cream really is hydrating! Non-greasy and just melts into your skin. I love the way my skin feels after I have used this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Roping with Anti Monkey Butt My 5 year old grandson will not rope without his Anti Monkey Butt on board his horse Dr Pepper while roping. Gage keeps his Anti monkey Butt product on the back of his saddle at all rodeos he uses it to smooth his ropes out before each competition! Thank you Anti monkey Butt for helping to encourage a champion cowboy!!
Anti-Monkey Butt Anti-Friction Powder Anti-Monkey Butt Anti-Friction Powder is the best for eliminating unwanted odors entering into the atmosphere. It also helps keep the area it is placed on to stay drier friction free! Do not use this in your mouth or ears or up your nose. That is NOT what it is designed for! It is most effective around the Butt Area (hence the name). Great for cyclers!
Fantastic with My Kilt!! Before I leave for any Highland Games I use Anti-Monkey Butt Powder. Wearing 8 yards of wool in Southern California can be rough. Your product makes working and walking at the Games pain free.
Anti Monkey Butt It really works. (See attached photographs). . . . . . . . . . kidding.
title says it all I love this product. I have been using it for 2 years after someone told me about it at work. It literally calms down any chaffing that you have breasts or butt. I am a larger woman and do manual labor so it is great to powder the inside of my bra and my underwear. It also keeps you smelling good. This product puts to shame any body powder out there on the market. Try this product and you will never use anything else. I know I don't.
Works great! Helps keep skin dry under the liner and socket attached to a prosthesis (fake leg) which is extremely important!
Perfect for the boys and men in my life This is an awesome solution to the boys/ guys getting a little irritated and swampy around the Netherlands in the warmer weather or working out . Works great- offers tons of relief!
Awesome product. Does it's job wonderfully. Heard about this product from my son. Worked wonderfully for his heat rash and keeps him dry while he works construction in this heat. Wonderful product. Would recommend it hands down!!!!
"MONKEY BUTT POWDER THIS IS THE BEST POWDER FOR ANYONE WHO HAS A PROBLEM WITH MOISTURE ANYWHERE WEATHER IT'S AROUND THE BOTTOM AREA, GROIN OR BELLY, IT STOPS THE MOISTURE AND DOESN'T CAKE UP LIKE MOST POWDERS DO."
Amazing This works amazingly. In 120 degree desert heat. My husband stay cool n refreshed.
My go to moisturizer I love this product for how my face feels after I apply it. I keep this cream by my computer to remind me to moisturize my face daily. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Best powder ever! Great for anyone who perspires when working out--body building or exercising or out working in the yard in hot weather or indoors in the heat. I have tried many powders medicated and baby powders and spent a lot of hard earned money only to have most of the container put on a shelf somewhere. Anti Monkey is the only one that has consistently provided real protection for my skin. I have also introduced it to my family members as well and they've wanted to know where to buy it so it worked for them too.
Monkey butt This stuff is FANTASTIC.. it helps with itching and rashes and chaffing.. its just silky smooth and over all excellent. I tell everyone I know about this product.. lol now if you would just sell it in the arizona stores life would be perfect.
amazing This really helps prevent chaffing.
"Love this Stuff for Diaper Rash My son always get diaper rash because he has eczema. I bought this on a whim to try because regular diaper rash cream made it worse. This is magic in a bottle. Now I sprinkle on him after every diaper change. No more redness or irritation. Love it. My only complaint is Walmart doesn't keep enough of the baby and lady versions in stock. It is always sold out. So, when I see it I buy several bottles at one time. This powder is nice smelling and keep skin dry. It's a must have for baby bottoms."
"Decades of Painful RedAss who knew. Decades of Painful RedAss who knew. I was dealing with puffy painful skin irritation for all my life , in my older years i wanted to get my rear situation addressed and started to try things like Proactive body wash , desitin, AD , baby powder gold bond , nothing worked , If it wasn't such an embarrasing event I would have asked a skin doctor. I was buying some gear to go camping and seen monkey butt at the counter , I asked the person if it worked and he said yes he uses it so i got a small bottle. 24 hours later my butt was on the mend after being battered for all those years. Now once a week I will apply boudreauxs butt paste just to hydrate and protect, I'm cured , I would have paid allot of money for a cure .. I had jock itch once and if anyone knows how painful it is, the cure is pennies. you would literally spend thousands if there wasn't a cheap cure... Same thing with monkey butt you guys saved my butt..."
great product ..Used this for about 5 years... try it all my friends do ..
"Great Stuff! Anti Monkey Butt is better than Gold Bond Powder, I use it every day, it cleared up a rash in just a day, try this it works!"
"Worth every penny! Buy as a joke...use every day. Stores are always out, had to order on line."
Skin relief This works very well. It is especially great in the summer. Fresh and dry.
"Nothing else comes close to this amazing product! I bought Anti Monkey Butt Powder some years ago for my husband who is an avid cyclist. He uses it all the time and says nothing even comes close to comparing with this product. As for my complete devotion to Anti- Monkey Butt Powder---From time to time I develop very sore, stinging skin eruptions on my arms when under stress I take Effexor for PTSD which likely adds to the skin sensitivity. I've tried prescription medications for the skin eruptions and nothing has worked. UNTIL I tried Anti- Monkey Butt Powder ! which soothed the skin, took the stinging sensation down several levels and I will put forward Saved my Sanity from the constant stinging. I live in Canada so it's being a real chore finding where to buy more... But Anti- monkey Butt powder is worth its weight in gold. Nothing comes close to the soothing and drying properties of this product."
"This product works very well. With aging skin, moisture loss is a problem on a daily basis. This product keeps my skin moisturized and softens the wrinkle lines. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Fantastic stuff got rid of all the chafing and redness in my skin folds. Also made me more comfortable. I've tried a lot of stuff, but this is the best friend for a 'large' person!"
"Makes driving long trips easier I often take long trips, and after the constant moving, sliding, etc. on the driver's seat, my bum gets a little irritated. Boudreaux's Butt Paste would fix this situation, but I didn't like the greasy feel after using. This stuff lubricates without being greasy, so there is little or no irritation after a long drive. Also good for Slot Machine players sliding in and out of the chairs."
heard about it from friend Works great
"Fresh and flirty I work in EMS and have some rough days. I know I will stay fresh, clean, and dry with this powder. I recommend it highly!"
Anti Monkey Butt Powder is great have used this product for 5+ years and it is great.
"Best stuff EVER !!!! For many year's I had to deal with having Monkey Butt Nothing but a pain in the butt when having your boxer's creep up your crack and getting stuck and sweaty while riding my bike either on the street or off road as well. Now it's not even a thought unless I run out or forgot to bring it with me on a run or weekend outing.. I hope to see it on store shelf's someday soon since I hear that once you hit 50 you tend to forget things here and there, and to forget bring this can really ruin having a great ride. so Don't leave home without keeping your Monkey Butt in check !!! Great product !!! ."
"Do you ride a motorcycle If so, you need this! I bought this for a friend who rides motorcycles. He's a larger fellow and he says when he goes on long rides this product is a necessity."
Not monkeying around I got this from a friend as a gag gift. Jokes on them because I love my monkey butt powder. It dries up sweat and smells amazing.
No more swamp butt! I've been using this powder for 5 years now. I always use it when I'm racing or practicing on my dirt bike. Me and my friends would get swamp buy bad racing for hours and traveling great distances on a trail ride. Thank you for making this powder...we'd be sore with out it!
Works great Highly recommended
"Love the Hydration I have used this product for over 6 months now, and my skin feels soft, smooth and hydrated. I like how it works on wrinkles too. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
FOR MORE THAN JUST YOUR BACKSIDE! I have been using this powder for one year now on my back side and it is amazing! Today I have found a second awesome use for it. I use an electric razor and fond if I apply the powder to my face after a shower it absorbs the moisture and makes the hair stand up straight which allows the electric shaver to get closer than ever! It leaves my face feeling smooth and comfortable with the wonderful Calamine scent. I highly recommend the powder and going to try the shampoo and body was next.
Great product! Great product! Anyone with chafing issues with their private parts should try this product.
Great powder I love this powder I have used it for years
"Better than any other powder! This was bought for my hubby as a gag gift, but I used it up when I started to get rashes in the summer. The doctor said use any powder to stop the friction, so I would use it for a day or 2 the rashes would clear up. Now that I ran out, I have been using ordinary powder every day for the past few months not getting any relief. The doctor was wrong, this is the most effective powder I have found."
Monkey Butt Powder I ordered this for my mother. They did not have it at her Walmart. She is very happy as I knew she would be. Regular use will prevent chaffing.
"yep! I'm dry I've been using this for years now. I work in a production shop where the AC doesn't always work. a few sprinkles in the morning in my underwear, some down my shirt and I'm good to go. I took AMB to Alaska with me too. they have some loooong hiking trails I have to say AMB really helped me and my girlfriend out. if you don't already use this, what are you waiting for"
"Anti-Monkey Butt, a tropical traveller's savior As a biologist specializing in tropical biodiversity, I can say with certainty that Anti-Monkey Butt Powder is essential gear for anyone traveling in the tropics! Chafing can put you out of action quickly in the heat, but Anti-Monkey Butt is the best option to keep you dry and pain-free. I've used Anti-Monkey Butt Powder in jungles and rainforests around the world, and never travel without it!"
works great great for summer heat
"Underarms I use your powder for my armpits as I have grown an allergy to regular deodorants. I love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone. Please consider an applicator for this use, as I end up with powder everywhere. It prevents heat rash as well. Thanks for such a great product."
Cured my Stank Feet I have had raunchy stank feet my whole life. I tried EVERYTHING to help them I bought the Monkey Butt powder to try because it had a different ingredient. Now I'm totally comfortable taking my shoes off around people! Everyone thanks you- especially me!!!!
Moisturizer I skin has improved while using this product. Before using this product my skin was flakey. Now my skin is soft and much improved This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Love it!! I registered for this for my baby shower. It was actually just as a joke but once our little one arrived we tried a few different diaper rash creams. We decided to try the powder and now it is all we use! Seems to keep our little man dry and happy! Thanks for a great product!!
Amazing downtown relief!! I've used this product for years. I use it in my bra to keep swamp boobs at bay. It completely relives all chaffing. This product is a god send. It doesn't leave residue or stop working throughout the day and I don't end up with balls if powder. Always have some in hand!
"Amazing I deliver mail, outdoors sitting on my butt in the Florida heat. Nothing beats Anti-Monkey Butt for the famous Florida Swamp Butt. I have used the product for almost three years and nothing compared to it. It beats Gold-Bond hands down"
"Love Love LOVE it! The whole family uses it. I bought this for my Toddler, then it kept disappearing because my Husband stole it. So, I used it too, and we all love it."
Great product! I bought this a few years ago for my son that races motorcycle. It worked for the sweaty chafing. Now I am going to purchase the lady version for my 16 yo daughter that plays competitive fastpitch softball.
Keepin Soldiers dry I've been buying this for my husband for years but when our son got deployed I knew right away he was going to need some anti monkey butt in his care packages !
No friction riding horse for 8 hours! This was given as a gift and I started using it when trail riding for 8 hours.. no pain or chaffing! Bought 3 more.
Life Saver I used AMB power on my boss and now he is much less of a pain in the butt!
Great stuff This is the power I ever used.
Butt Miracle Ever since i bought this my monkey's butt has been looking great!
Moisture I love how this makes my skin feel during and after. It has some serious moisture and a smoothing effect. I feel hydrated all day! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Does its job well better than most Never has a better protection from sweat an irritation.
Does What it Says Best powder I have ever used and I tried them all. Does what the label says
"Great product I love this product, I just wish they sold it on the shelf instead of having to order it."
Great product Found this product to work well. The scent was minimal and I would recommend it.
Good product! Well done Monkey butt! Keeps that baby's butt clear!
"it's works great, it's works great i ride a lot and it does the job,,,,,"
"The best stuff ever! My bum is drenched in sweat during work, not now!!"
wonderful Name says it all! It really works!!
"Formula Changed.....BOOOOOOOOOOO!! I used to be a very loyal user of this lotion. I have very dry skin and it is important to me to take care of myself. I have tried a multitude of lotions over the years, searching for one that actually worked. I was nothing short of grateful when I finally found this product. It was the only lotion I used. Period! I told everyone about how great the product was. Until a few months ago I got a new bottle and it SUCKED! The results were so different I thought maybe I just got a bad batch. The subsequent purchase of another bottle that SUCKED prompted me to review the ingredients proved to your company decided to cheapen a product that used to be of quality. I have told everyone that I can not to waste their hard earned money on this product anymore. I know I won't. Very disappointed!"
"Formula changed I bought this with the original formula a year ago and it was great, loves how it worked. Had a great light fragrance that I could tolerate. I was running low so I bought a new bottle and noticed that the light fragrance I liked was gone. After checking the bottles I found that the formula changed and along with it the good smell. It is awful. Won't be buying this again and will be returning the bottle to the store. Why change a good product."
very soft Love it. I can feel the result in few days. I will recommend it to my friends. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I love these products I use regerest ever day and it makes a big difference in my skins texture. I really see a big improvement in my overall apperence. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Says non-greasy, but definitely isn't! I bought this two days ago and it will be going back to the store tomorrow. I am usually happy with cure products but find that my hands stay greasy. But, I read the label for this type and it said non-greasy and absorbs quickly. No such luck. Very disappointed in thus Cure product."
i bought this thinking it wouldnt work but it does Works great on my feet And on my dry hands I would buy thus product
More of the same! I have used almost every lotion or cream on the market and they all have good/bad things about them. This is a good product but not much different than most top brands.
"Good hand lotion Curel Ultra Healing is a good moisturizing hand lotion. The major drawback is the parabens in it. If they would remove those, I would give it 5 stars."
"Does moisturize well It does moisturize well,but I really need the anti-itch formula to combat my seboreah"
"Hand saver Works wonders! Having issues with hypothyroidism and OCD frequent hand washing my hands were scaly, raw, and burning this helped in two days. Wish this was cruelty free, so not 5 stars."
"short straw I love cruel lotion and have used it for years however I am tired of having to stand my 20 oz bottle upside down for days to get the last 20 out of the bottom due to the short straw on the pump I can't find tubes or bottles with lids, not pumps in the fragrance free. It is too expensive to just discard the product in the bottom of the bottle, so I am going to search for another brand. I love the lotion but not the container."
"Good lotion When I initially used it, had great results. I believe you all may have changed some ingredients in it as it is not working the same like it used to."
works well i tried this a few months ago during the winter and it was great now that gardening time is here it's a must have for me
non greasy I like this lotion. it does not have a strong scent. it is not greasy and soaks into skin. it works pretty good.
"This product keeps me young!!! I love how it makes my skin feel. Whether I where makeup or not, I have a beautiful glow to my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
long lasting! It seems somewhat watered down but it is great! Very long lasting though. I love it! One of my top three lotions!
Great lotion for dry skin Great lotion! I usually use daily moisture but this product was great for extra dry months.
Really worth buying I am using this product and it is really a worth to buy.
Easy to apply Use it regularly and love it. It has many uses and my family can use it too
Thick Soothing Both baby and grandma feel soft and have clean scent
Awesome Great product.I would like to recommend this to anybody
Curel It really works well especially when your skin is dry.
A staple in our home A few years ago my dermatologist told me about Cureal and I decided to try it. From that point forward it has been the number one buy for skin moisturizer in my household. My children have issues with dry skin and the ultra healing lotion helps to keep their skin from looking dry and cracked.
"Instant Help I really like this lotion because it gives instant relief. I use alot of different hand soaps and some cause my hands to dry out my hands instantly. I use some of the Ultra Healing from Curel, and my hands feel so much better. There is no greasy feeling residue. It is my new go to lotion."
Good lotion but old formula better I had been using this for a while but I noticed the formula changed to a slight thinner consistency. It still performs well and keep my skin from looking ashy during the warmer months and during the cold months I prefer something a bit thicker. Over good quality lotion.
LOVE THE FEELING WHEN ON SKIN.. I LOVE THE TIGHT FEELING WHEN APPLYING THIS CREAM...IN MORNING MY SKIN LOOKS AWAKE!!!! LOVE PRODUCT This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great for dry skin! After living in the west Texas desert and moving to a humid climate in Asia, my skin was ravaged by dryness. Curel Ultra Healing helped with the cracked heels and flaky skin! I especially love that it is not at all greasy!"
Nice feel I received this as a free sample and loved it! It didn't live my skin feel sticky but smooth and really helped with my dry skin. I plan to buy this in the future.
Only lotion I use! I've been using Curel for 3 or so years! It is the absolute best lotion! It took me awhile to find a lotion I could use on my body AND face. Curel is a fabulous product and it will always be the only lotion I will ever use. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.
Best lotion ever I have been using Cur'el for years. It's the only lotion that keeps me from drying out. I have really dry skin. What a difference this makes. Love it!!!
soothed my dry skin I am a dental hygienist and I wash my hands all day long. That causes very dry and cracked skin. After using this lotion my hands feel so much smoother and they feel great!!
Ashy I love this lotion it's the best it takes care of my dry ashy skin keep it soft and smooth. I also recommend Cure'l Rescue its also very good!

2.5 fl oz Curel Healing Lotion This is the best lotion that I have ever tried I am over 60... SO I bought one for my 40 year old daughter as she has very dry skin... any way I am sure she just loves this lotion too. is very thick and luxurious feeling.
No more excuses for dry skin! I have been using this lotion for a while now and it works. It lasts all day and my skin is smooth and not greasy.
Great lotion. I really like this lotion. I received some as part of my Christmas present. It's great lotion and works wonderfully on dry skin.

This product has amazing results I love that it makes my skin so soft and it really hydrates which I had a looked a long time to find This review was collected as part of a promotion.
An 'old' skin necessity! I am close (too close than I care to admit) to 70. I am diabetic and have turtle skin on my legs. It looked so dry and scaly that I refused to wear anything but long pants. To make matters worse I have a new granddaughter that has the silkiest skin I have ever felt. I used the Curel ultra healing lotion and now my legs are almost as silky as the baby and I don't even have to use it every day...I have taken my shorts and dresses out of the closet! Thank you for a product that actually does what it says it will do! I have recommended this to everyone I know. I even have my husband using it!
"Ultra Healing I received a sample, and went out and bought a bottle!!! this product works!!!! I work and deal with money as a cashier, and meat, at a supermarket, so I am forever using hand sanitizer and washing my hands, and they get so cracked and dry. I tried Curel, Ultra Healing, and this product works!!! i no longer have dry, cracked hands. I keep the small trial size in my smock pocket, with me at work, so its always with me. I also use the big bottle at home, for daily moisturizihg. It works on all your body parts, and my skin is very dry, living near Chicago, out winters are cold, and the Wind, is sooo bad, that this is the best lotion out there, to prevent dry, cracked, flaking skin. I also have Diabetic skin, and it is gentle enough for me as well. I trust Curel, and have been using it for almosr 2 yrs now, and I highly recommend it. It absorbs quickly, without leaving you greasy. Of all your formulas, this one works the best for me!! Thanks Curel. BW"
Works good Love it use it all the time would recommend to a friend
Great! Ive tried many other lotions and Curel is the best the rough skin Curel was no where close to the Ultra Healing one
Love it I love how smooth and silky and makes my skin feel
Curel is a Cure all One of the best products I have ever used. You do not feel like you have lotion on because it goes right into your skin
Best ever The best out there! It works like magic. The moisturizing effect is great
"Works great! My husband and I suffer from dry skin. We have tried many, many lotions, only to find that they don't really work. Someone mentioned Curel to me so I decided to try it. I bought the Ultra Healing because, well, it said ultra healing. First, it works great. It absorbs easily and does help stop our itching. Another thing I like about it is that it has a pump, so you only need one hand to operate it. I make sure to never run out of Curel, because we use it everyday."
Wish the store carried this in abundance Perfect size and perfect price but it's so popular that the store is almost always sold out
"Best ever!!! I've been using Curel for over 10 years. I was introduced to it in the hospital by a nurse after my surgery and it has helped my skin stay soft and holds my youthful look,(even though I am 60 years old). People have guessed my age at 38 to 44. I give credit to Curel all the way. Thank you for having this on the market for me and others out there. I constantly tell people what I use. Thanks again."
Very Lightweight Cream Love the deep hydration regenerating cream for it's lightweight feel - not oily or heavy feeling. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Only lotion I will use I use this from my feet to my face. It isn't greasy and doesn't have a strong smell or strong 'unscented' aka waxy plastic smell. It absorbs and cures even my worst dry skin. It also doesnt cause breakouts. I always keep an extra bottle around because I don't want to run out for even a day. I also use it on my kids sensitive/eczema prone skin. I literally have nothing bad to say.
"Best lotion out there I've been using Curel, Now that you came out with a Ultra Healing I'm even more excited. I have very very dry skin. I use this lotion all the time and I get so many compliments about my skin being so soft especially from my hubby. Who wouldn't want to hear that from there hubby. I find that very sexy. Works great on freshly shaved legs as well."
"Amazing! I got this a while ago, and this lotion does wonders! My skin gets extremely dry, especially when seasons change or it is too cold. This lotion moisturizer my skin without feeling too heavy and oily. My skin is smooth after I put it on, and it absorbs very quickly. I love this lotion, and I recommend it."
"Great product for my dry skin I use all of the different Curel products, and they all work well for me. They keep my skin moist between showers. Some lotions seem to only last for a few hours. I can even skip a day using Curel. I would like to see them make a product with an SPF factor to use for daily sun protection."
Very dry skin fix I love this product. Here in the Northeast the winters and dry heat in homes can really make your skin dry and itchy. Both my husband and I have used this and it really does a great job at healing the horrible dry skin we get in the winter. Not greasy and feels great
"Great for Extremely Dry Skin I bought this for my husband who is diabetic to use. It has cleared up all of the patches of rough, dry skin he had on his arms and legs. I have always loved Curel Lotion, and now my husband is a fan too. Works just as well as the diabetic formula lotions."
Actually heals dry skin! I received a sample of this lotion and was truly pleased. I have always suffered from extremely dry skin all year long and all of the lotions I had tried prior just didn't do my skin justice. Curel actually healed my dry and unmoisturized skin very quickly.
"Very good lotion I have been using this lotion ever since it has been on the market and it does a great job handing my dry skin. Even though I am retired, I wash my hands all the time and my skin dries out severely and this lotion does a great job making it soft and supple."
Love this lotion! This is the best lotion I have ever used. I have very dry skin and it does a great job of moisturizing and is not greasy. I apply it in the morning and my skin stays moisturized all day long. This is the only lotion I will ever use.
Cure ultra healing What a fantastic product. It's not greasy absorbs great. Love it for my new tattoos and my dry skin. Costs a little more but well worth it. You don't need much for big coverage. Keeps moisturized for at least 24 hrs.
luxurious feel The cream feels very luxurious when applying. Keeps my very dry thin skin moist and more pliant. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Best ever! I have used Curel for many years for my sensitive dry skin. The Ultra Healing version is the best ever for my skin. Serious hydration makes my skin feel and look better, even during Midwestern winters."
curel ultra healing works great and so easy to pick up at walmart
Soft skin finally I have some of the worst dry skin and after using this for a few days - my skin stopped cracking. Most lotions seem to just give me a greasy feel but do nothing for the skin - this actually works.
Ms I HAVE BEEN USING CUREL AFTER HAVING IT RECOMMENDED ONLINE BY SOMEONE AND FINDING IT IMMEDIATELY HELPFUL FOR MY DRY ITCHY SKIN. I USE IT AFTER EVERY SHOWER AND DAILY ON MY HANDS AND ARMS.
Awesome Lotion!!! This Ultra Healing is worth whatever price is because I felt immediate relief from the very first use! Curel is a fabulous product and it will always be the only lotion I will ever use.
Excellent for Cracked Skin I have used this lotion for several years and it works great. It soaks in quickly and doesn't leave your skin greasy. I usually get crack skin on my hands and this heals it quickly.
Great consistency and moisture My sister swears by this particular line of Curel lotion. I tried it and I have to agree. It is very nice. I love thick lotions that actually sink in and moisturize the skin.
Use it as a moisturizer and it is quickly absorbed This has been very effective on my face and I am very impressed with it. I also use the Curel Rough Skin Rescue which is very effective for my dry skin on my feet. Love it.
Great for extra dry skin I'm a nurse and I wash my hands a lot during my shift. I keep a bottle of this lotion in my bag and it really helps to keep my hands from getting that dry ashy look and feel.
"Not real Mario Badescu I have been using Mario Badescu products for years. I usually buy my products directly from the store in New York or online from Nordstrom. When I realized amazon sold Mario i figured why not order from here....terrible decision! these are not real Mario products. It smells differently from what it should and the color is off. This product foams differently and burns my eyes terribly. The real thing is very mild and gentle, it does not burn your eyes and has a very delicate and light smell to it. I absolutely love Mario Badescu products and highly recommend them, I would suggest that anyone who wants to give the products a try go directly to the mario site or Nordstrom ( they have free shipping). So disappointing to see that there are people out there giving such a great brand a bad name by producing cheap imitations great Buyer beware!"
This product has wonderful features I tried this hydration products and it's amazing the way it makes my face feel. I really love it This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Beware new formula Ingredients have changed and the product looks nothing like the photo on Amazon OR the MB website - it now looks like shampoo (white pearly opaque) instead of the very light yellow translucent product. This now has artificial fragrance which is an allergic reaction trigger for me. Not risking my skin, which responded so well to the old formula.These are the ingredients on the product I received:Sodium Lauryl Sulfate,Aqua (Water,Eau),Cocamidopropyl Betaine,Cocamide MEA, Glycolic Acid,Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract,Hypericum Perforatum Extract,Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract,Althaea Officinalis Leaf/Root Extract,Achillea Millefolium Extract,Sodium Chloride,Parfum (Fragrance),Propylene Glycol,Methylparaben,Propylparaben,Diazolidinyl UreaThese are the ingredients published by Amazon via the product images AND what is on the bottle I already have:Deionized Water (Aqua), Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Glycoloc Acid, Matricaria (Chammilla Recutita Flower) Extract, Yarrow (Achillea Millefolium) Extract, St. John's Wort (Hypericum Perforatum) Extract, Chamomile (Anthemis Nobilis) Extract, Sage (Salvia Officinalis) Extract"
"I was going to write a horrible review. When the actual soap came from the ... I originally thought that this Mario Badescu face soap was fake, because of the reviews. I got it and saw the bottle is now an opaque bottle. I ordered a real one from Mario Badescu website, thinking the one I ordered for Amazon was fake. I was pissed thinking Amazon ripped me off. I have been using Mario's products for about a year now, religiously. When I noticed the bottle looked different and the soap smelled a little bit more lemony, I was going to write a horrible review. When the actual soap came from the website, I noticed that it was exactly the same. It smelled the same, and they just changed the bottle. I didn't return it and I felt silly. I now kept it for a re-up for when I am done with it. Do not be worried that this product isn't real, it is. I guarantee it!"
"Great for deep-cleaning pores and targeting acne, but not recommended for daily use Mario Badescu is more expensive than regular drugstore brands, but this Glycolic cleanser is only about 15 for 6 oz., which is much cheaper than higher end cleansers I have used (such as Uriage Hysac, which I love enough to recite vows to, but cannot afford!!!).I use this as a clarifying cleanser in place of my regular cleanser once a week, just to really get deep into my pores and target acne. It is not recommended to use it more than three times a week, just because Glycolic Acid can be irritating for sensitive skin. People with dry or sensitive skin should use it 1-2 times a week, and people with oily or very acne-prone skin can try 2-3 times just start off using it less frequently and build up to see what works for your skin type.Honestly, I don't use this foaming cleanser frequently enough to have major beef with it. It foams up nicely and a little goes a loooong way. I'm pretty sure I'll be using this bottle for the next ten years LOL! It is a clear, yellowish gel that is rather runny. You should rub it between wet hands or a wet washcloth for a few seconds until the lather forms (it is runny, not foamy like shaving cream) and gently massage it into your wet face for a minute. Then, wash offdon't forget a cold water rinse at the end!and pat your face dry. Always follow with your regular toner and moisturizer, as this can be very drying! It makes my face slightly red right after usage, but that's expected due to the high Glycolic Acid content. I use it at night only anyway, so it's not that big of a deal. If you use it in the daytime, you should wait until the redness dies down, or cover your face with a good SPF to protect the irritation.I have an affinity for gel cleansers because they are perfect for oily skin.Read more"
"I Can't Believe it's not Irritating I have hypersensitive skin (I get rashes instead of regular breakouts) and I needed a chemical exfoliant. I also wear makeup everyday. This saved my skin, point blank period. I use it about every other day because I do get oily when I wear makeup, and I know my pores are STRESSED lol. It doesn't make my skin peel, and unlike other reviewers, it doesn't leave my skin dry. Just refreshed And it's ridiculously soft afterwards.I seriously cannot believe this cleared up my blackheads AND reduced my hyperpigmentaion from acne scars in just 2 weeks. This stuff is freaking amazing.Packaging: 10/10I LOVE the packaging. It has a great little spout that's super hygenic. I used this in the shower and absolutely no water got in it.Product: 10/10I still can't believe I didn't break out from this. I'm starstruck. You won't need a peel if you use this. I'm serious.Price: 10/10I'm not trying to give Mario Badescu any bad pointers but.... if I had used this without knowing the price, I would've guessed it would of cost 50. Seriously. And it doesn't run out! I'll edit this review when I finally reach the end of it.100/100 ADid this review help you out Then please click the Helpful button below! It helps me know what to include!

"Use it every day twice daily I have been sick for 5 months now and my dark circles and redness around my eyes really was hard to hide. I felt hideous. While bed-ridden I had done a lot of research on different products and this one seemed to fit the bill. Of course I did expect a miracle over night but it did not come. But as I continued to use it every morning and evening, I did notice a change after about 4-5 weeks. You can't beat the price for the quality of this product. I use it with my moisturizer before I put on make up in the AM. And I use it at night when I cleanse my face and use more moisturizer. This Tube has made a big difference for me! I love it!"
Great moisturizer but not for men Excellent moisturizer but very heavily perfumed which was not noted on the bottle. Unsuitable for men. What a pity!
Won't purchase again I wanted to moisturize my elbows and feet. This product does moisturize but feels greasy on initial application. WORST thing is the odor...it is absolutely awful. I won't even categorize it as a fragrance. This will be the only bottle of Nivea that I try. Too bad...it had great promise to be something good.
"Too Much Fragrance I dislike this formula as it has way too much perfume/fragrance in it. It's like I sprayed my hands with perfume and it transfers onto sheets and clothes so you can't get away from the scent. In addition, I dislike the texture. It feels like I have a film of some substance on my hands as it doesn't soak in and moisturize the hand. It just sits on the surface and makes my hand feel like they need to be washed. Terrible product"
Ships wrong size! Don't order this! The product is amazing but it is listed here as 16.9oz and the product they ship is only 13.5oz... A 20 percent difference! Very misleading and then of course when you call customer service they barely speak English and aren't helpful. Disappointing!
Love IT It just makes me feel more confident using this product. Nobody believes I am 57. Thanks Olay!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Pass I didn't really like the smell of the lotion, and while it made my skin feel moisturized, it left me feeling itchy."
Not good I dont like that smell off that boby wash

"Smells like I took a bath in perfume It's a shame that this lotion has such a strong, flowery fragrance because it seems like it works very well. I bought this because I really need a deeply moisturizing lotion during the winter. I also live in an area with hard water, which is harsh on my skin all year round, but it seems worse in the winter because of the cold. At the store, the scent didn't seem too strong but once you actually pump it out of the bottle the smell really hits you - and it lingers for hours and hours when you put it on. If you're sensitive to strong fragrances, you should NOT buy this product. I got a migraine within half an hour of using it the first time, and I ended up taking a shower shortly after to wash it off because I couldn't stand the smell. Fragrance is listed in the ingredients so I expected some sort of scent, but with a scent this powerful you would expect it to be advertised on the label. I avoid flowery-scented lotions because they almost always give me migraines, and I could have avoided this lotion if Nivea had advertised this as a scented lotion. If it seems like I'm harping on the scent too much, it's because this would have been the perfect lotion without it. Even though I washed the lotion off after about an hour of wear, my skin still feels very moisturized two days later. I haven't used any other products because I haven't needed to - even after taking a shower, which is usually when I need a moisturizer the most. This lotion has a smooth, easily-spreadable texture that absorbs well. My hands felt a little greasy after I applied it, but the rest of my skin felt fine and didn't stick to my clothes or feel gross. If you need a super-moisturizing lotion for a reasonable price and strong perfumes don't bother you, you'll probably like this lotion a lot. Unfortunately the fragrance is just too strong for me to even consider using it again. Thankfully I was able to return this to the store I bought it from, and I purchased an unscented heavy duty lotion from another brand instead. If Nivea ever makes an unscented version of this lotion, I'd be happy to try it again."
"Fragrance too strong This product feels good on my dry skin, but has a very strong fragrance that actually makes me nauseous. I wish I could find its equal with no fragrance. Nivea, is there a fragrance free option"
"Nice fragrance, but irritates my skin. I loved this lotion here in high desert Utah but the fragrance which is actually quite nice irritates my skin. So if you're like me and you have a bad habit of touching your face a lot don't use this. Find some other lotion that is fragrance free. Hopefully Nivea will eventually market a fragrance free version because the lotion feels very nice and rich."
"The Scent is Aweful! Great product but the scent kills it. With a great number of people looking for unscented products today, let alone products made with with more natural ingredients, does Nivea insist on adding perfumes to what would be outstanding products At least provide unscented versions. I think you'll see a boost in sales. Hence my 3 star rating."
"Moisturizing, but Smells Weird I was really excited to try this lotion because I have horribly dry skin. It did moisturize my skin very well, but the smell of the lotion was horrid! I could smell it all day, and couldn't seem to get it off of my hands. Good moisturizer, bad smell!"
So many I feel like I get this in every sample box I get from anyone. I could make a whole big bottle based off the little bottles I have
"Great cream except for only available in tiny size Although somewhat pricey, this is the best hand cream I have found so far! The consistency is rich and thick, but does not feel disgusting on your hands. I don't usually write reviews, but found myself on this page because I was looking to see if Nivea makes a larger size. Which brings me to my only complaint: it appears that they only make the 1.7 ounce tube.This is small, like what you might throw in your bag to carry around during the day....a bit pricy & not very long lasting during the winter."
reduces wrinkles I use this at night for wrinkles on the face. It does a good job reducing wrinkles and taking a couple of years off your face. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great product! Light moisturizer....feels like nothing on my face, but does a really nice job on fine lines. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"good Makes dry skin feel soft! Not greasy, last long, and has a great texture!"
Good moisturizer with great smell I liked it too much. It also smells good. it's best for the dry skin.
Very good I realy like this.
My Experience Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. NO greasy residue either.
Lotion Great
Great Moisturizer I like this body lotion because it is a great moisturizer. I like that it did not feel greasy to me and did not feel like I had lotion caked on.
Love the moisture!! I really love the moisture this product provides. A huge plus is that it smells good and clean too! The texture is just right. Loved it!
Great product at a great price. An old girlfriend got me onto the NIVEA brand. Always a good outcome. From shaving gel to hand lotion NIVEA is good stuff.
great for the skin Got my sample in the mail and love the way it softens my skin. The scent is a little too strong for me. I would prefer unscented.
"Contains parabens This product is moisturizing and long-lasting however, it is also greasy. It's also pretty heavily perfumed. That didn't bother me that much though. Several months into using this product, I was disappointed to find out that it contains parabens."
This product is amazing have used this product for over a year and am constantly told I do not look my 74 years of age. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Liked texture and effect. Did not like fragrance The feel of the lotion was exquisite. It really made my hands soft, but I had to wash it off in 5 minutes because the fragrance was overwhelming. I would buy it if they made this formula non-scented."
Very good! Product works very well. Softens and moisturizes and even stays on through washing hands- in a good way. Would have gave five stars but the scent us a little strong. Thanks for the sample!
"This product really moisturizes! This product is great! It goes on smooth and really moisturizes m skin. It is no too thin or too thick when applying to your skin. I even use it on my toddler, small children, and husband, who all have dry skin. An added bonus is that the fragrance is not bold. It is mild enough and pleasant to wear on hands or our body. It also lasts all day. I would recommend this lotion for anyone with dry skin."
Love this lotion I needed a bottle of lotion for my desk. During cold/flu season handwashing and sanitizing was taking a real toll on my hands. This is the best lotion I have every tried. Absorbs immediately and lasts until the next handwashing. I would have given it a five but the scent was a little strong for me.
SILKY SMOOTH This product is great! Makes my skin feel incredibly soft! I put this on ASAP after a shower. My skin will feel amazing for 48hrs! Its not sticky either!! Only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because i bought the pump and it wouldnt pump so i manually would have to open the bottle. Oh well.
"A great product In a week, my skin was greatly improved. I saw results that were beyond what I expected. The only problem is that the scent is very unpleasant. I can use it only from the knees down with long pants on so I cannot smell it. I wish it came unscented then it would be a perfect 10!"
"Great smell I love the smell of this moisturizer, it was very coating without being thick and left skin smooth and smelling really nice, fresh and clean."
"Great Cream Except For Only Available In Tiny Size Although somewhat pricey, this is the best hand cream I have found so far!

"Absolutely Works As Advertised In these modern days, companies make a lot of claims, but not all work the same for all of us. But, this Nivea products definitely helped my extreme dry skin condition. I started noticing improvement within 2 days (as advertised)."
"love this product love this product, what I do not like is the tube, very hard to squize."
Regenerating Cream I loved this product. My skin was so soft and fresh looking. It took years off of my look. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Surprisingly soothing I love this product. I normally have extremely flaky, dry skin and haven't found anything that helps as much. The lotion seems to smooth the skin and keeps the flakes at bay for a whole day. Wonderful."
Awesome! Best Ever.... This is the best hand location I've ever used and I've used a lot -- at 55 years old and a prior sun baker.... This is awesome! Thanks for making a great product. Love it :)
"Just incredible I use this product not only on my hands, but dry patches on my body and face! I leave this in my purse and have it with me at ALL TIMES! I need to buy more because I'm almost out of it. Incredibly moisturizing and not at all greasy feeling. I don't write reviews, but for this product, I will. It's THAT good!"
"long lasting! feels great on skin. dries quickly butt feel moisture, its great!!"
Helps with very dry skin I use this on my son who has very dry skin and it moisterizes his skin very well! it lasts about 10 hours before I have to put more on which is better than others that iv found. He loves it and so do I!
Extended Moisture Lotion I have two samples of this lotion. Not just the hand creme but the actual lotion and it smells amazing and leaves my skin soft and smooth all day. I went to the store and bought a whole container today because I cannot get enough!
Required daily Wonderful moisturizer! I use it daily because I love it!
"The Best Lotion I will never use another lotion again. This stuff is so moisturizing, it is instantly absorbed into your skin and leaves them feeling instantly softer. And on top of that, it smells great too!"
"Excelent, I love it I have tryed an endless number of moisturizers, hands down, this is the best!"
"Awesome sauce! Keeps my skin from feeling dry, but also doesn't leave my skin greasy!"
Return of softness This cream leaves your face feeling so soft and smooth I would recommend it to everyone This review was collected as part of a promotion.

All around awesome product! I love the scent the feel on my skin. Excellent!
This product does wonders I apply Nivea Extended Moisture to my hands after washing dishes and I am always amazed with the softness it creates almost instantly! I am thoroughly impressed with Nivea products!
"This product was surprising I was pleasantly surprised on the soft texture of the lotion. Once applied, I loved how my skin felt. It was soft and smooth and pleasant to the touch. I will buy this today!"
Nice Nice
"Love it! I got a sample a few weeks ago and since then, it never leaves my purse!! Ive even bought the bigger bottle for my home. I love how it leaves the skin soft."
Love that the moinstizing lasts I enjoyed using this lotion specially at school it gave me moisture during the day and I could see the change of my skin from being dry to moisturize skin
Nivea Lotion ahd Body Wash Feels rich and doesn't feel greasy on the skin. Don't have to use as much to cover. Don't need much Body Wash to suds up. Both products are great!

"I think it's the best! Nivea, has been my favorite for several years. It's long lasting, only takes a small amount and it's non-greasy."
"Excellent This product feels great! It isnt greasy and keeps my skin moisturized for a very long time, even through hand washing.."
Good Product Immediate results when I used this Body Lotion! And no overpowering scent! I like this product and will buy again!
Aw awesome It's really good I've been using this product for a little over a month it's helped my skin get all it needs.
"Moisturize my skin.. I always love Nivea products ever since,it leaves my skin healthy,smooth and soft..I love the smell too..."
GREAT PRODUCTS I got a sample in the mail and I like the smell and how it made my skin feel so nice and smooth
Moisture plus I just received my sample. This moisturizer made my skin feel nice and absorbed quickly.
"Love It I have always loved Nivea products but I found their original lotion too thick to apply onto my skin, but I loved its results. This lotion is not so rich as it is light. It is between light and normal and gives your skin the same results as its thicker or richer sibling."
"Anne Excellent for dry skin especially if applied after showers. The product is very light, goes on smooth and long lasting. A good option for those who are looking to switch from their present thick, heavy lotion. This product is not greasy and leaves the skin feeling very soft."
"Please begin making UNSCENTED products! Extended Moisture Daily Lotion feels soothing without being sticky and greasy, however, I won't be purchasing any more unless there is an unscented product. In fact, I would love all of Nivea's products for extremely dry and sensitive skin to be UNscented!"
This product works great I have noticed that my skin feels softer and stronger since I started using the cream. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Perfect Lotion for dry skin I received my sample in the mail the other day and finally got to use it today. It sank into my skin fast and did not leave a greasy film. I smells great, I love the fresh clean smell. My skin is very dry and with this lotion it stayed soft and firm all day."
Soaks skin with moisture This product is a quick and easy way to revitalize your skin. Absorbs smoothly into skin without residue or greasy feeling. Skin looks soft and glowing instantly.
Everything is great about it I received my free sample and love everything about it. It has a great smell that is not overpowering. I love the consistency and how easily it absorbs into my skin. I also love the way it feels once it's on. It's not greasy like some.
"Good Stuff! I recived a sample of this in my influenster vox box and I was very pleased with the lotion. The consistency is nice, the scent is great, and the overall experience I have using this product is excellent! I will buy again!"
"My skin is very soft with this lotion! I've tried many lotions over time and none have worked as well as this one. The softness lasts a good long time and i really like the scent. I like how the lotion absorbs quickly into my skin and is not greasy. Thanks, Nivea!"
My new fave I was initially skeptical as I am not a frequent user of Nivea products...until I purchased this on a whim!! It is very light and moisturizing as promised! I will purchase again..in bulk do not want to be without this product!
great soft and smooth Love the lotion .my feet get really dry when the weather changes. Love the way it smoothness stays for hrs. After putting it on
"Great product I love this product, i started using this extended moisture about 4 months ago and i can see the difference in my skin. My skin always feels moisturized and even after a bath, it does not feel dry or tight. Love it."
"Nivea extended Moisture 48 hr. body lotion I have very dry and cracked skin. This product is Fantastic! I tried many items before and none worked. It makes your skin feel soft, smooth, healthy and not greasy. It truly lasted for the 48 hrs long."
This is a great lotion I have tried many products for my African American skin this is the best product I have ever used I highly recommend this product for everyone.
"The Best...EVER Until I found this product I was feeling hopeless. Now that I have been using it I loveit and there's no way I'm ever giving it up! If you want to feel and look beautiful, this is it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love Received my free sample in the mail. Loved it. Smells so good and it makes my hands feel so soft. Love using Nivea products. Plan on getting this in the store soon.
Awesome This's sooo good for your skin five stars
"best body lotion ever! I have been using this Nivea body lotions for years. I loved the fresh clean smells, and extended protection. I usually used it after shower in the morning and before going to bed. I woke up in the morning the skin still so soft and so smooth."
"excellent product OMG I can not tell you how many products I have tried without getting a rash or still feeling dried out. I'm going through some kind of change, I'm going to be 50 in November. I purchased the one with the bamboo extract in it. So far no rash and I feel so soft even after being at work for 10 hours. I woke up this morning and still legs look and feel soft. I think I've hit the jackpot finally:) Thank-you"
"One of the best body lotions When you use this body lotion, it makes your skin moisturized and it stays moisturized for a good amount of time. With this body lotion you don't have to keep reapplying it often. As for the scent, its really hard to tell what it smells like, but the scent it has is nice. I really recommend this product as it works well, especially if you have really dry hands."
"Best body lotion ever! I'm almost 50 years old and have started experiencing dry skin, especially last winter. This lotion was recommended to me by a friend with eczema. I love the scent-so clean! And this is the only lotion that I've tried that does not leave a film of grease on my skin. It actually soaks in and works. No need to use more than once a day. Great product!!"
The best lotion I have tried! I just put on my sample lotion. I never thought I would love a lotion this much. I have had these dry spots on my knees for a week and I have always had dry feet. The lotion made them instantly smooth and soft. They have never felt this good. The smell is very pleasant. I will definitely be buying this in the future and I highly recommend it!
"Simply the best! This product is truly awesome! I have extremely dry, tight skin so I have to moisturize more than once a day. I received a sample a few days ago and applied the lotion before I went to bed last night. I awoke this morning to soft, supple but non-greasy skin that did not need more moisture! I must have more!"
"I was already using it. I discovered it about a month ago. I love this lotion by Nivea it is the best for me, as I work out in the sun and I get very dry skin. Not any more! It is amazing how it sinks right into my skin and there is absolutely no greasy feel. All I feel is softer. I received my sample today. Thank you."
Nivea Works great on dry skin.
Velvety feel I love putting this on my face and neck. My skin feels velvety soft when I use it and reminds me of the soft touch of my horse's nose when I was a child. I enjoy this line very much! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Have been looking for this I have been looking for a product that would moisturize and last longer that a few hours or when I did anything. The promises are true, the product is good and you won't be disappointed. Don't believe me, request a sample and I'll see you at the store soon."
"It really does last Due to a medical condition, I developed really dry skin. It was embarrassing to wear skirts or shorts because my skin did not look good. I carried lotion everywhere or just covered up. This lotion solved my problem without being greasy. It feels really silky on my skin. I LOVE it."
"Nivea extended moisture I first used this product at a client's house and I was impressed with how little I used but it covered both my hands and arms. I love the rich feel of it and feel its worth the price charged. I usually used generic brand lotions, but 'm willing to spend a little more for quality."
Best lotion ever. I received my free sample in the mail and loved it. It has no greasy feeling going on and soaks right in. I went out and bought a big bottle and use it everyday. My skin is softer than it has ever been. I have found my new daily lotion. Love it!!!
Works way better than expected I have VERY dry skin and I always try new lotions that claim they are for dry skin and yet just sit on top of my skin never actually helping and making me feel greasy. This however sank right in and made my skin feel nice and soft and I could actually feel the difference. I hate using lotion because its always so slippery and greasy but I actually love this one and use it whenever I need it.
Good Value This is a great value and really helps my dry skin. It does not leave my skin oily after using it. I will definitely buy it again when I run out.
Nivea Extended Moisture Body Lotion I always love Nivea products! This lotion was no exception. It was very moisturizing and kept my skin feeling very soft and radiant all day!!
"Great for my dry skin I have extremely dry skin, especially this time of year. Great product!"
Leaves your skin smooth I loved this product. I bought some after I used up the sample. It left my skin soft after the shower. I was impressed.
Very good lotion! I love Nivea body products and this did not disappoint! I received a sample of this in my beauty box and used it all up pretty quickly! I wish the sample size had been bigger.
"Great Product This cream is great for me. It makes my skin so soft. Being 50+ and post-menopausal, my skin has been drier and I tried many different brands of moisturizing cream. This is the best. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Excellent! I have used the nivea in-shower lotion for a long time now and when i used this lotion it was just the best. It soothed my skin and made it glow. I highly reccomend
"Amazing lotion walmartbeautybox this lotion is the best. it is a little pricier than others but it works great, is very lightly scented and doesn't leave you feeling greasy."
I love nivea! Very nice trying out this particular formula. I have enjoyed Nivea lotions in the past :)
It made my skin feel amazing I love this product!! My skin felt amazing and was moist!! I have really dry skin and this took care of it!!!
"I love his lotion I am a fan of Nivea products. I work out doors. My skin take's a lot of abuse from the sun and weather. Just because I am a man doesn't mean I like the feeling of dry, rough and premature aged skin. I received a sample bottle of this lotion and loved the way it made my skin feel. I also enjoy the scent too. Although, it maybe a little strong to wear around a construction site. I will continue to use my favorite Nivea products. However I will add this lotion to my shopping list."
"paeNY I always like NIVEA Lotion , love it"
"I Am In LOVE With This Product! I received a sample of this in my Spring Fling Voxbox from Influenster and I am definitely going to be buying the full sized bottle of this product! It is not greasy, it doesn't clog pores the smell is light and not overwhelming! I have already recommended this product to my family, friends, Instagram followers and FaceBook friends!! I LOVE this it really works! I have noticed the collagen in my skin improving and even less cellulite!"
Great lotion Keeps skin moisturized all day long.
Love this lotion I love this lotion! It's not to heavy and not to thin. Smells great and moisturizers your skin really well. I recommend a Javier lotion in the winter
"Great lotion, not greasy, keeps skin feeling moist We tried this and love it. Couldn't get at my local WalMart, so I ordered on-line and got it a day earlier than expected. Yes, it is really as good as advertised! My sister has a skin condition and this really works on her extremely dry skin."
"The best product I love all oil of Olay products, and I have been using them since I was 13. With the regenerist deep hydration, I can't wait for tomorrow as using it I get better looking everyday! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
New Favorite Lotion This lotion was given to me in a gift basket and it has become one of my favorites. I love to put it on after a shower/bath and my skin feels great!!!
Smells good. Love Nivea
best lotion ever.. I don't use anything else ..leaves skin soft and smells great..
Truly extended moisture I have escema and really dry skin. This lotion doesn't just moisturize immediately but lasts longer than most other lotions I have tried
"Both my husband and I have very dry skin. This is our savior! We've tried just about every product for dry skin, but nothing comes close to this product. It is irreplaceable and I have some stock-piled because I thought you were discontinuing it and because it is essential for our daily use. It's not too thick but one can feel the product on one's skin the day ater using it. It's wonderful and better than any expensive oils or lotions I have tired. Keep up the good work, Nivea!"
Love it my skin loves this lotion. smells great too.
"This product really moisturizes my skin I was born with extremely rough and bumpy skin and have tried numerous brands of body lotion to smooth everything out. However, they did not work. They were either too oily or the scent was too strong. I came across this product and tried it out. I have to say this is the best one. I use it every day after I shower. It smoothes and moisturizes my skin - especially the rough parts. It is not oily and the scent is good and not too strong. The best part is when I wake up the next day and my body still feels very smooth. I highly recommend this product"
"Silky smooth This product is true to its title. It really does have extended moisture. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. It also has a pleasant, clean scent."
yes It does the job of moisturizing your skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Sample of Amazing! I got a sample size of this and just from the small amount it was amazing how much it worked definitely makes your skin feeling smooth and soft. Would highly recommend this!
"too scented for me Although this product worked amazingly well, the fragrance gave me headaches and made my eyes water daily-Olay please make more fragrance-free products."
Love it! I have very sensitive skin and rosacea. I have been using this product regularly with no outbreaks at all. I love the thickness of it and the way it does not feel greasy. Thank You! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I like it!!! I really like this lotion a lot! I use it every day right after I shower.
Love it! Love it!
Excellent Awesome
nivea lotion Very good on moisture. Feet could go an entire day without the ashy look.
Nivea lotion It works all day! Really like it.
Nivea Extended Moisture Body Lotion Like this product.
"This is the best lotion I have ever used! I love for my skin to feel soft and smooth, so I typically use lotion after every time I shower or bathe...until I found this product. Sometimes I am in a rush and do not have time to apply lotion and hope that my body wash will be enough. This usually results with my skin being left dry and scaly in places. Since using this product, I have found that I can go 2 -3 days without application. It has left my skin feeling silky smooth and looking amazing! The scent could be improved, but it only smells when you first apply the lotion. I have sensitive skin, so it worried me at first, but I never had any issues. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for fabulous, younger looking skin!"
Makes skin soft I am hesitant to try new lotions because I have very sensitive skin. I tried this and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. It went on well and was not greasy. It also left my skin very soft for days. This is great because I only received a small sample. I have been using other brands but don't get the same results so I plan on switching next time I go shopping.
"The Perfect Lotion my son has really dry skin. he is 8 years old and baby lotion just does not cut it for him. we can apply it on him after his bath in the evening and by night time when he's about to goto bed, his skin looks dull and dry again. i was searchin for something thats not too thick that its hard to apply but smooth and easy application as well as longer lasting softness. i just received this lotion today and i tried it on my hands. i like the light scent and the texture is just right, light and smooth. it left my hands feeling very soft. i just washed my hands about 10 mins ago and my hands still feel soft. i will be using this on my son tonight and i have a feeling we've found the right lotion!"
Excellent great lotion! my skin is so soft after its applied and leaves a glowing effect! great price for a quality lotion :)
"Great Hydrator I have really dry skin and I loved how this cream kept my face hydrated all day long. I only needed to apply this in the morning and my skin felt smooth, soft and silky all day. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Best Hand Lotion Available I have tried numerous hand lotions for dry cracked finger tips. I live in the Chicago area where hands really get chapped and dry in the winter. In 1day of using this product, it has repaired the splits in my finger tips. I highly recommend. I do wish that this product was sold in a larger tube."
Required Daily Wonderful moisturizer! I use it daily because I love it!
"Surprisingly Soothing I love this product. I normally have extremely flaky, dry skin and haven't found anything that helps as much. The lotion seems to smooth the skin and keeps the flakes at bay for a whole day. Wonderful."
Helps With Very Dry Skin I use this on my son who has very dry skin and it moisterizes his skin very well! it lasts about 10 hours before I have to put more on which is better than others that iv found. He loves it and so do I!
"Just Incredible I use this product not only on my hands, but dry patches on my body and face! I leave this in my purse and have it with me at ALL TIMES! I need to buy more because I'm almost out of it. Incredibly moisturizing and not at all greasy feeling. I don't write reviews, but for this product, I will. It's THAT good!"
"Long Lasting! feels great on skin. dries quickly butt feel moisture, its great!!"
"Love This Product love this product, what I do not like is the tube, very hard to squize."
nice i like it
"It's all about Hydration!!! I apply at bedtime, when I wake my skin looks refreshed. I've been kissed by the Sun more than I should have!! So the Regenerist Deep Hydration gives my skin a much needed Drink. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Keri Could not handle the smell of it.
great prices Good price
Silky skin Makes my skin feel soooo soft
lellery I love Keri. I have been using it for 30 years. It keeps your skin young looking.
Keri Lotion This is a thicker lotion that is good when I need a little more moisturizer.
Kent Lotion Crear product
"So soft and smooth, feels wonderful on your skin. Perfect."
"Great lotion at a great price! I love Keri lotion. I have used it for years. With the addition of Shea Butter and Vitamin E, Keri has become a hit with both my family and friends. I recommend Keri to everyone I know!"
"Awesome product! Have used this for years because it works. Keeps your skin smooth all day without need to reapply. Obviously others agree as it doesn't sit on the shelf at the local Walmart long. So, when I saw this on-line, stocked up for the upcoming winter months. Another plus is nobody beats Walmart's price for this item."
"I love this product. Great product, although the formula has changed a bit over the years."
Excellent Product I am 81 years old and have been using this product since I first saw it...It is an excellent...keeps my face soft and greatly reduces the look of wrinkles...Can't be without it! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Love it Great stuff This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Best OTC Lotion on the Market I have been purchasing the Keri SHEA lotion for several years at various Walmart stores. The store closest to me in Benbrook, Texas always had it on their shelves until recently. So, I ordered it on line from Walmart. I ordered (6) and received (5) of the Keri Shea and (1) Keri original. I would like to know if Keri is discontinuing the Keri Shea product, or is Walmart discontinuing the Keri Shea product. Help!!"
"Best for Extemely dry skin My mother and aunts have used Keri products since the 1980's. We all have very, very dry skin. We also have used the bath oil. I currently use the bath oil as an after shower moisturizer when I am pressed for time and can't lotion my body. But, the Shea butter gives a longer lasting moisture to my skin and hands,."
The Best Love it. It's been my lotion for many years.
NICE This lotion is so nice and it smooth on the skin. My dry skin loves Keri with shea butter!
Best lotion Ever! If you have seriously dry skin you must try the Keri Shea Butter!
Works Wonders I have been using this product for 5 years now. I love that it is not greasy and leaves your skin feeling soft. The fragrance is not overbearing. Love it!
Loved it I purchased this lotion because I had a coupon and it is excellent! It left my skin sift and non greasy. The smell is nice and not perfumed like some lotions. I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin.
Love it! This the only lotion I love and works!
awesome Smooth on the skin
Young In a Jar This product helps me feel and look younger! Excellent hydration for tired stressed skin! I started using this for my sun exposed skin to keep it healthy! Love this product!!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Keri Lotion with Shea butter I have extremely dry skin and this is the best lotion I have found. No greasy feel and my skin glows.
"Perfect for dry skin... I love this lotion. I've been using it for several years. I have very dry skin, so it works best for me."
Great Lotion Love this lotion only one that works for my family and I
Love this lotion It does not have a greasy feeling to it!
"Lighted Mirror It's a beautiful mirror, but I didn't like it because the lighting seems to obscure your face. I couldn't see better, it was worse. I've had an unlighted wall mounted mirror for many years and I thought the lighted one would be better, but it's not. I'm returning it."
led jerdon 5x make up mirror excellent product look and works
"Great Bathroom Gift For Ladies Very nice makeup mirror. Affordabke, Compact 5 x 9, 5X magnification, LED backlit. What's not to like"
A perfect magnifying mirror I took my girlfriend to the Trump Hotel in Wash. DC for her 74th birthday. In the bathroom they had a magnifying mirror that swiveled and extended. She just loved it for her ability to put on makeup. When we got home I searched the web and came up with this Jerdon mirror. It appeared to be exactly like the one she used at the hotel except it was chrome finish instead of gold-looking. I ordered it and it was easy to install. It is of the same quality. The light around the sides is perfect.
"Nice and Bright. This mirror is amazing. I had a Jerdon lighted make-up mirror but it wasn't bright enough. It has the warm lighting and I really needed brighter white light to be able to see adequately. This mirror is very bright white lighting. It's modern looking and the magnification is perfect. So much better and I'm very pleased. The only gripe I have is the screws that attach to the base have to be removed to wall mount it and the company had screwed the screws on sooooo tight, we almost stripped the screws trying to take them off. I honestly have no idea why they would attach them so tightly since they do have to be removed to wall mount it but we almost gave up and returned it. Finally my son (27 years old) was able to get the screws out (there's 3) without stripping them but it did take him quite awhile of working on it. But the mirror is well worth the money and now I can see!"
Well-groomed At 74 years of age it became increasingly difficult to stay well-groomed what with eye-site failing etc. This lighted magnifying mirror solved that problem. It really works as advertized. And it was easy to install. Now my wife no longer says...you missed a spot.
"Excellent moisturizer and wrinkle cream. I love the product, leaves skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I always recommend Olay Regenerist to friends and family. I have used it for years and it is well worth the money. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great product Absolutely love my new mirror. Great resolution for up close and personal detailed work such as putting on makeup and plucking my eyebrows!
Mirror This mirror is fantastic!!!
Bad reaction Used it for the first time and completely broke out in acne. This product is not for me. Age 15
"Would not use again This mask has a nice texture and consistency as well as a good smell. After applying this mask and following the directions I have to say I think this was a little too harsh on my skin. I have very sensitive skin that gets dry pretty easily and I was not a big fan of this product. I received a free sample of this product and was very excited to try it out, but I was disappointed."
I'm so scared I brought this used it and afterwards pimples came on my face the same day in to point five seconds I don't know why but I'm nervous on why should I stop using it or is that suppose to happen
Love It! The only reason I rate it four stars is because I only used it once and am not yet sure how effective it is. Other than that small problem I find that it smells amazing and it has a good thickness and makes your skin feel amazing along with it smelling amazing. Once you rinse off the formula you continue to smell it. I can't exaggerate how amazing the way my skin glows and feels smoother instantly! Definently worth the purchase!
"Honest Review This product worked great on my oily acne prone skin! I noticed the next day that the redness of some of my breakouts had became invisible. The oil production on my face had also reduced and my pores were visibly smaller. I will be purchasing this soon! I received this product for free for testing purposes. However, my opinion is honest and true."
Good Product This product is pretty good. Applying it is easy but the mask itself is a little slippery and slimey. It's definitely not the best mask I have used but it is nice on the skin. Would use again! I tested this product as a free sample but this review is entirely my own opinion.
"Good Product I tried this mask as a complimentary sample from Influenster. It had a really nice, natural and herbal scent. I applied it with a mask brush and waited for 45 minutes to remove it. During the drying process, a few areas on my face burned a little but that is to be expected. After removal my skin felt soft and moisturized. I prefer glamglow supermud, but this product was a contender. I love the company's ethics."
"Amazing I recieved this product free from influencer for testing, but all opinions are my own. This product was amazing and it worked wonders on my skin"
Results were excellent I received this product as a birthday gift from my daughter and started using it immediately. The results were excellent as I suffered from dry wrinkled skin around my eyes. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Good Mask I have only used the mask once so far but it did what it is advertised to do. My skin felt great after using this. And it fits into my skin routine nicely.
"Great For Acne Exfoliantant I Love These Products! How to use this Mask too clear your skin Use the African Black Soap, then the African Black Soap Problem Skin Facial Wash Scrub, than put on the African Black Soap Problem Skin Facial Mask.. You have to use this brand for every step. You can use a different product for a toner only. Shea Moisture now carries a toner-African Black Soap Problem Skin Toner. When you use a new product such as this mask it PULLS the oil up out the PORES.. So you will have a few break outs as it is cleaning your pores out.. Be patient and drink alot of water, no sugar, no sodas, no dairy, take your vitamins..."
"It has to get worse before it gets better ! I read all the reviews and I was very curious since I love all the brands products. I bought it and yes it does make you breakout ! BUT it's supposed to! It can't just magically give you great skin! There is gunk in your pores, and this brings it to surface and after using the whole acne system it'll kill off all the bacteria causing acne! So don't just give up after one use, (that goes for any acne ridding products honestly) stick to it for atleast a month! P.S it does sting me too but what's beauty without pain! Suck it up ladies !!! ( combo skin ) P.P.S it does smell like play dough"
"Love it works great after using it for a while I love this product! The first time i used it, it made my face break out but i kept using it and it cleared up my face and as long as you keep using it, it keeps your face super clear. Also it smells like playdoh but i don't really care cause i don't smell it after washing it off."
"Hormonal balance , finally So, I have endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome and miss Matt works amazing to balance both imbalances I get from those diseases"
"LOVE This! I love this mask! Although it will burn after awhile, it soaked up oil so well and speeds up acne's healing."
"Light Formula and Amazing Scent! I tested this product for free/complimentary thanks to Influenster, but all the thoughts and opinions are my own! When I first received this product, I was extremely excited to see it was a mud mask. I absolutely love mud masks as they help control my oily skin and acne. I'm always looking for a new one to add to my collection. What I love most about the mask is how light it is on your skin! No caking, no cracks, and no blotchy red skin! It comes off with little hassle and makes your skin feel so refreshed without drying it out. Plus it smells HEAVENLY when you open it! Application I so easy and smooth. I was surprised at how light the formula was for a mud mask, but that ended up being better for my skin in the long run. I have extremely oily skin and hair, so anything that removes it without drying out my skin (which will cause over production of oil) is top on my list!"
"Best product ever i have never written a review in my life.. mostly because I've never been blown away with a product enough to take the time to write one. With that being said, I had never struggled with acne until college and I have been struggling with adult onset acne for the past 4-5 years. I tried dermatologists, Curology, over the counter meds, basically everything. I decided to give this a try as well as the African black soap toner and bar of soap after doing research on it for weeks. This was a game changer. The flare ups started to settle and the bumps on my face seemed like they immediately shrunk. I am in my third month using these products and I am getting my confidence back a little more every week. I would 100 recommend these products. Actually, any Shea Moisture products I would recommend.. their hair/body products are just as amazing! Thank you for offering such incredible products.. you guys are literally changing the lives of people!"
Great buy My skin is incredibly problematic and this product has helped my acne clear up! My face feels so much smoother and my makeup applies amazingly
I LOVE IT I have really oily skin and my pores are always clogged and I've tried many face masks that claim they unclog them but this is the only one that has I've only used it once so far and as soon as I wiped it off my pores looks so clean I love it so much and definitely recommend the only thing is it smells like play-do which doesn't bother me at all but may bother others
Youth in a Bottle I am 60 years old and have used Olay products for 20 years. I do not have any serious wrinkles on my face at all and am told all the time that I do not look my age. Thank You! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Magical Potion I literally keep telling everyone I know that I think this is some kind of magical potion. It has drastically changed my skin for the better. My skin is staying matte and clearing up! NOTHING else has had this effect on my skin. I am elated! My skin is softer and finally looking radiant rather than dull. When I do get hormonal breakouts they clear up so fast...like magic. Please try this whole line if you are dealing with any skin issues. Who the heck cares what it smells like...it WORKS!
THE BEST FACIAL MASK FOR SENSITIVE SKIN This is my first time using this product I can say I'm totally obsessed! I have sensitive skin and most of facial masks make my face feels itchy but this one made my face feels soft and fresh. I used it with the scrub and both make a perfect combination! I totally recommend this facial mask to anyone who wanna try it! I tested this for free but all opinions are mine.
Left my skin so soft and smooth! I absolutely loved this product. It left my skin so smooth and got rid of my black heads. Also the packaging was so pretty it made the entire presentation. I would definitely recommend this to a friend because I want them to experience this great product! So glad I got to test this out for free on influenster.com!
EFFECTIVE I got this in the mail the other day forfree and am loving it!!!! It's so good for my skin!!
"Love I love this face mask! Along with the rest of the system, it has helped clear up my adult acne. When I first started using it, I used it every other day, and now I use it once a week. It leave my skin feeling very soft and draws out all the gunk before clearing it up which helps it stay clear longer."
"I love this product!!!!!!!! I have acne prone/ sensitive skin and I usually break out when trying something new.. I gave this mask a shot started using it 3-4 times a week (more than recommended) but my skin has cleared up SO MUCH. After purchasing this, I was able to cut down my skin care routine by quite a lot. I now just have to apply the mask and then a spot treatment and it keeps my skin under control. Many people say that the mask stings, but my skin is very sensitive and I find that it doesn't sting at all. It has a very cooling sensation and the smell is actually nice!"
"Pretty, smooth skin again. I bought this for my daughter and her skin clears up really nicely. She uses it once a week or when she has a break out and her skin gets clear fast and looks so pretty and smooth. This is a great product, can't go wrong. It does what it says as with all their products."
"Beautiful!! I was struggling with hyper pigmentation and my face just seemed to hate me, and then I found this. The next day I instantly saw my face lightening and glowing."
sheamoisture-african black soap problem skin facial madk Very happy with the produce and the timely delivery.
It's good... But at first it broke out my oily skin with tiny little bumps and then cleared them up in the next two uses. So it's good with me.
moisturizing This product leaves my skin feeling and looking fresh. Being non greasy is also important to me. I'm 60 years old and my skin looks as good or better than women half my age. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
One Star I am very disappointed. All three of these were melted in the tube an totally unusable.
EXPENSIVE Way overpriced. Nothing wrong with the actual item. Go to burts bees website they have brought back cocoa for 5 a piece!
Four Stars Awesome colour - why did they discontinue it
"Great alternative to lipstick It's a shame that I've been having so much trouble finding Burt's Bees Cocoa Lip Shimmer in supermarkets lately, because this is by far my favorite color in the set. It seems to have been replaced by Plum, which is a much more orangey-red and doesn't go to well with my skin tone... Oh well. All the lip shimmers are great products and (I think) superior alternatives to lipstick - they show up differently on everybody (skin tone seems to play an important role in this), but once you find your color, you will have a lip product with natural and understated, yet noticeable, hue. It is not nearly as thick and pasty as lipstick, and has a great mint flavor and scent which allows you to surreptitiously lick it off if need be. The Cocoa shade has a purplish-gray, almost metallic look to it when applied. It doesn't look nearly as gaudy as I'm making it sound, and the color works very well for me, a pale, dark-eyed brunette.There are a couple disadvantages to the product: It is very slick and will never dry or solidify on the lips, which means that it is just as liable to rub off onto your teeth and hands an hour after application as it is a few minutes after and something about the texture greatly enhances every flaw in the skin of your lips as you rub them together, which means that every single biteable nub that you never noticed before is going to be screaming for your attention until you take care of it. The Lip Shimmer is also stupidly expensive for less than an ounce of product, but this is Burt's Bees, after all. Overall, if you are an infrequent makeup wearer or not fond of lipstick for most of the obvious reasons (terrible taste/smell, gaudy shades), this is a great alternative to achieve some slightly subdued lip color - but if you are an everyday wearer, you might try to find something a little less expensive."
Love it Nice color to much for price I think
"Five Stars This color is perfect for my pale, olive-toned skin and moisturizes nicely, so it's always in my bag."
Discontinued Color Nice color and fun to be able to get a discontinued item at a reasonable price.
"Wonderful Color - Bring It Back To Stores, Please! I love this color. I so wish Burt's Bees would it back to the stores. I'm glad I can still purchase it online though."
Five Stars Great Product! I Love it! It shipped on time and is exactly what I wanted.
Glad it's still available this way Wish they still made this shade! Glad it's still available this way.
"wonderful product This product has amazing results, it leaves your face so soft and hydrated you feel years younger. It is a must have on my bathroom cabinet and a daily and/or nightly use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
So thankful to find this since burt's bees discontinued this ... So thankful to find this since burt's bees discontinued this color.
Five Stars This is the best everyday lip gloss
"The perfect lip balm. When this was discontinued, I probably tried 20 other lip glosses/balms and none were nearly as good. This goes on and moisturizes like a lip balm and this color is perfect with my skin tone. I have been buying online since they discontinued. SO glad someone pointed out that burtsbees.com has this shade still for only 4 right now!! Just bought 5 from that site."
"Love Burt's Bees! I absolutely love the Burt's Bees line especially the cocoa shade lip shimmer. Great shade, minty feel, and natural look!"
"I was so disappointed when they discontinued this product They brought it back - YAY!!! I was so disappointed when they discontinued this product. It's wonderful that they listened to their customers and started making it again. However, these prices are ridiculous! You can get it on the Burts Bees site for 5.00. I just bought a half dozen. :)"
"Very Moisturizing with a nice tingle from the peppermint without the taste! Burt's Bees is an incredibly moisturizing lip balm/shimmer/gloss! Usually anything this moisturizing does not have the amount of color that this has. My lips feel so good after wearing this all day, but it looks as good as lipstick! It isn't sticky or smell bad like a lot of lip glosses, either. It has no taste (no strawberry, for example). I think I am one of the last holdouts to try Burt's Bees, but now I am a believer! I highly recommend it."
"Found it! Friday, January 15, 2014, went to burtsbees.com and bought 11!!!! Go!Plan to call them Monday to check on inventory."
Burt's bees lip shimmer I like the lip shimmer but I thought I was getting 4 or 5 of them for 20.00 not one. It was for a friend so it was worth it.
"Are you kidding me Cocoa is the color I have used for years . I didn't know that it had disappeared from the shelves until I was applying my Cocoa lip balm Nov 1,2013 and my girlfriend asked me where I got it And I said I've had it and she said if I ever see it again to pick some up for her. So I start looking for it and now here I am with no more Cocoa ! I am so upset. Will you please bring it back"
So glad I found it! Best color ever! I can't believe they discontinued it! I searched the internet and found it on ebay and here. Prices were similar but this vendor seemed more reliable.
"Like the old formulation better While I do love this product, having used it for at least 10 years, I prefer the old formulation better. I feel the new one doesn't hydrate as well, and leaves a thin film on my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"product is smooth I would recommend this product to anyone. My husband loves the way it feels on his face also. Definitely think that it has helped my skin, I have been using it for years. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Just What I Wanted!! 2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No Great product! I can't find this color, Cocoa, in the stores anymore so I ordered 2 four packs. I am SO happy to have a new supply. SO happy to have my Cocoa Burt's Bees shimmer once again. Smooth, light, shimmery...perfect for summer time...or anytime. I don't wear a lot of makeup so I like it because it looks good if I head out to the gym with just my lip shimmer on or have on some mascara and bronzer too. LOVE IT!!!"
Love this Shimmer! 2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No I love this product. The shimmer looks so good with my skin tone (I am African-American brown skinned woman who has a lot of red undertones) and it serves it's purpose as a great lip balm. I am buying several more packs of this color. :)
"Another hit One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No Burt's Bees lip shimmer in Cocoa is another good Buts Bees product - I appreciate that something is made for the lips with some color, shimmer and class that my lips can tolerate. Thank goodness for Burt's bees!"
"Favorite lip product! This is my everyday lipstick Chapstick. I love the color and the feel. I have used this particular product for years and will continue for life, I'm sure! Please don't stop making it! Haha.This is a great value..best I have seen!"
"Great Color, Great Lip Shimmer I LOVE this color! They discontinued it for a little while and I about cried! I even contacted the company asking if they had any extras I could buy. Imagine my joy when they brought it back! They even emailed me to announce it and sent me a free sample. LOVE how moist this keeps your lips and that it is a lipstick and a lip moisturizer in one."
"it is/was a superior product. What a shame 2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No I bought this from Amazon when I discovered Burts Bees quit making it a part of their line. WHY I have no idea! I see comment after comment on various social media sights and on their site itself asking why Burt's Bees will not continue to make this shade. It's as if they ignore all of the hype. Anyway, it is/was a superior product. What a shame!"
"So excited to find this product. One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No This is my favorite lip product have been very disappointed that Burt's Bees as discontinued this color. So, I was VERY excited to find it through Amazon at a very reasonable price. The products were exactly as described shipped very quickly."
I've been using this for 5 years -LOVE IT 2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No There is no better lip stick on the market. The color works on just about anyone and the soft shimmer is perfect day or night. I am a former corporate woman who is now a stay at home mom after 15 years of working -love having this pop of color that is not too harsh or overdone.
Great for Oily Skin These papers work great at absorbing oil from your face and they are easy to use.
Pretty pink! This lipgloss made a perfect gift to my granddaughter!
Outstanding product won't use anything else! I'm 54 years old work with the public. I can't tell you how many Women ask me what I use on my skin and ask me my age! The secret is in the red bottle I always tell them! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"GO BACK TO THE OLD FORMULA!!!! 15 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No Do NOT purchase Oxy's new product if you have bad acne or are sensitive to lotions/oils that clog your pores easily! The ingredients listed on the Amazon listing do NOT reflect what is on my bottle I purchased at the store, which includes butyrospermum parkii (shea butter) fruit. Why in the world would any product treating acne of any kind put shea butter in it! I suffered with acne my whole life and when I turned 40 I developed horrible cystic acne. Proactiv no longer worked for me so I switched to Oxy. I've since changed my diet drastically and the cystic acne is gone. But I continued using Oxy which made my skin almost a 100 clear. Not too long ago they changed the formula for the Spot Treatment and it had some sort of fragrance in it, which I hated because my skin is extremenly sensitive and breaks out easily with fragrance products. Despite that change, I continued using Oxy. Now with the change of the Face Wash I will discontinue using their products. My face was breaking out all over and I couldn't figure out why. BECAUSE YOU SHOULDN'T BE PUTTING SHEA BUTTER ON A FACE WITH ACNE!!!!"
"Latest formulation irritates my skin 6 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No I have been using Oxy face wash for most of the last 25 years. It has changed ownership, and the formula has been modified a few times, but my skin always responded well to it. This latest formulation irritates my skin and makes it break out! I don't get full-blown pustules, thankfully, but it has caused little bumps all over my face as if all my pores are clogged. I have stopped using it over the last couple of days, and those bumps are already flattening and drying out."

"Good stuff very pricy and poorly packaged. Was prescribed benzoyl peroxide for backne I develop after a sweaty gym workout. This stuff does the job. Compared to 4.95 a tube for the same thing at WalMart, and it doesn't get shipped with three tube loose in a box that causes the caps to unscrew and product to smear out."
"which is so bad I don't even know what to do with myself Has a new fragrance reminiscent of cucumber melon, which is so bad I don't even know what to do with myself. I add about 1/4oz of tea tree oil (which is good for acne) to the bottle and shake it up for a few minutes and it totally masks the crappy fragrance and it smells great now!"
Been using this for 10 years with a salitic acid ... Been using this for 10 years with a salitic acid toner and it is the only thing that keeps my skin clear - good/more cost effective replacement for more expensive skin care packages. It can be tough to find at the store and there are not a lot of other benzoyl peroxide washes on the market. Just wish it wasn't in such a manly package.
love oxy i have been using this for 2 years and its the best. i dont know if my face just changed since i was just going through a faze where i would break out but oxy has been my daily rountine for more than 2 years and my skin has gotten so much better. i love my skin i had never seeb my skin this nice. i follow this with a moisturizer because it does dry your skin but love it
"Best product for acne, and preventing breakouts! One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No I'm 25 years old, and have always had issues breaking out. I've tried multitude of products such as clean clear, neutrogena, biore, proactive, etc. This is by far the ONLY product that I've seen results with, and doesn't leave my skin dry. This is the ONLY product I will ever recommend."

"Relief 12 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No I love this cleanser! I used to have pretty skin growing up but despite that I would bounce from product to product because I wanted flawless. I am not saying this product makes my skin flawless but it has tremendously helped with the breakouts I have had over the past few months. I am 23 and have combination skin and I was starting to break out like crazy due to stress and just my skin! I was so upset and felt ugly. I felt like I was constantly putting pounds of makeup on my face. I started using this cleanser and the Oxy Daily Defense Cleansing pads. The past week has been dramatic. I was just going to give the product the typical two weeks and then try to move on. But since I have been using this, my breakouts have decreased. The cleanser doesn't have an overpowering smell. It can be used as a mask and it is actually pretty good with my Olay facial brush. I really recommend this product because it can be used so many ways and it does a fantastic job! CAUTION: It does bleach what you dry your face with! Make sure to use a towel you don't care about.UPDATE: I made a mistake! I tried to change up my routine and use something else. I used Philosophy purity gel cleanser which seemed to be fine for a couple of days and then the breakouts started again! I am now back on Oxy. My 15 year old brother has massive acne breakouts on his T-Zone, massive whiteheads and cystic acne. After watching him struggle, I recommended he use this with the daily cleansing pads. He has been using it almost 2 weeks and his acne has MASSIVELY improved! My mom has been going through breakouts with her new medication and now is going to try it as well. Oxy is a MUST have"
"best product around regenerist deep hydration regenerating cream works wonders on dry skin. regenerist goes on smoth, absorbs into the skin and last all day leaving skin smoth and hydrated. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A must have for acne sufferers My skin would not be clear if not for this stuff. Caution, it can bleach towels and linens though the brand of towels I buy seems to stand up to this. Note, this product is strong and may dry out your skin. For me, I have used it for years and my skin can handle it, but like all things you apply to your skin, try it out first and don't go crazy. I only use this at night since it can make your skin sensitive in the sun and don't want to risk it rubbing off on my clothes. Definitely recommend though for acne sufferers."
"... and rubbing it in for about two minutes works great for me Using a generous amount and rubbing it in for about two minutes works great for me. That long a treatment probably would be detrimental to more delicate skin. The cap is flimsy, if you drop it in the shower it's done for. The product is shipped without the individual tubes wrapped, and at least one pops open during shipment, creating a mess."
"I keep buying it, hoping... I keep buying this product in the hope that some day it'll help with the brown spots on my face ... hasn't so far, but I keep hoping... I guess I'm a slow learner. The dermatologist told me that nothing short of laser treatment will remove those brown spots."
Dark spot corrector I've been using this for around 2 weeks. The box says that you will see a difference in 1 week. I bought this to help lighten dark sun spots on my forehead and checks. I don't believe using the Neutrogena Dark Spot Corrector has made any difference in my dark spots. I am disappointed.
Not sure yet I'm a 59 yr old AA with dark spots on my nose from wearing eyeglasses. I purchased this product (rapid tone repair dark spot corrector) used for about a week now don't see any change yet. I will continue to use till all the product is gone or a fade in the dark marks....hopefully from what I've read in reviews the product works as for me nothing yet...will review again in a couple of weeks .
"Sorry I tried this Was excited after reading such good reviews to try this. After 2 weeks no change to dark spots. I am usually very happy with Neutrogena products but will not use this again, obviously very expensive for getting nothing out of it."
"Why Additives Why has Neutrogena added more and more fragrances to their products This product was so highly perfumed I developed a migraine within half an hour of application. This brand has been perfuming more and more products for no reason. Even the make-up remover wipes are overwhelming. I'm so disappointed in them as they are hazardous to those of us with sensitivities. I started using this brand many years ago and have seen it go from pure, simple and effective to unneeded ingredients that cause serious problems.."
"Used a complete tube I have used this age spot corrector for almost 2 months, using twice daily and the dark spots are still visible. The surface of the dark spots have flaky skin over the spots but nothing has changed. Highly disappointed!!!!"

"I still have dark spots after using this product Product nutragena dark spot remover. still have them so what now I use all nutragena poducts, and have been very happy until now"
"How can this happen First off, I love Neutrogena products. Have used them most of my life. Now that I'm older, I'm noticing those sun spots, dark spots, from age and sun. When I first started using the product, I did notice a slight difference in one or two of the dark spots. However, I started noticing that several of them started to look like the skin around them was turning lighter, and the dark spot was not fading anymore. As if that wasn't enough, I've gained MORE dark spots, and something is causing me to break out in areas I wouldn't normally have break-outs! The spots that I have (had were never super dark, just noticeable, but now there are more! Not to mention, the ones that I had seem as though they've increased in size and have become more noticeable. I do not get out in the sun at all these days so that cannot be a factor. Even if I do, I will always wear sunscreen. This was my twice daily regimen: 1. Wash with Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Foaming face wash. 2. Pore Refining Toner 3. Rapid Tone Repair Dark Spot Correcting Serum concentrating on discolored areas. 4. Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer day or night). 5. Rapid Wrinkle Repair eye cream. I wonder if anyone else has had any issues such as these. I really wish the product would have worked for me. I really don't understand why it's causing me opposite effects."
"Didn't Work For Me I used this religiously morning and night for 2 full weeks. Product said I would see results within 1 week. Well, I did not. My age spots still looked the same. However, the product did have a pleasant smell. It didn't feel gooey or sticky on my face and worked well under my powdered make-up."

Not the Same This product is not as good as the Neutrogena Rapid Tone corrector with moisturizer.
Too Early One week isn't a fair enough trial. No improvement so far.
"Depends on your definition of rapid I've been using this product since May 15, 2016 on 2 large dark spots on my face on the dark circles under my eyes. By no means are the spots gone, but they have lightened significantly enough for me to continue using it. My dark circles seem less dark too. I think the word 'rapid' should not be taken literally. But you can't call something 'gradual tone repair' or no one would buy it. I'm hoping for even more improvement by the holidays."
"works! it definitely works on brand new post acne red /dark spots .just bought my second tube , i used two bottles of the 50 clinique dark spot corrector and absolutely nothing happened , neutrogena is way cheaper AND it works . will keep using it"
"Works great so far! Two large dark spot on my cheeks just recently appeared after a few times going to the beach without putting on any sunscreen protection. So, now I am trying to find all kinds of products to get rid of them. I bought this product a month ago, almost done but have not seen any change. I like how it makes my skin feels and I am still hopeful it would work. I am not sure yet if I should buy another tube and give it some time."
"Helps fade acne marks This has really helped with fading acne scars using once daily .I like the consistency, it absorbs into skin easily and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I wish it helped more with my brown spots, but I am grateful it is helping fade the acne marks. I would buy this again."
Love the feel! I love the feel of this hydrating cream on my face. I have dry skin and this cream has helped me so much with fine lines. I highly recommend all of the Regenerist line. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Neutrogena Rapid Tone For Dark Spots I just started using the product and while I have not seen a lightening of my dark spots I think it might be working. I love the pump as it only squeezes out a small amount at a time. In addition it smells nige and feels nice on my skin. Time will tell if the product does what it said it would do.
"Great boost to my routine In Canada this product is on the expensive side for drugstore. Although the ultimate value test will come from how long it lasts as I recently bought it. But wow does it work great, and I think it's awesome Neutrogena added Vitamin C to brighten tone. My pours are smaller, skin is smoother and more even, and most of all I've seen a huge reduction in acne in my problem zones. However there's a catch with this product, and I'd love to be able to give it 5 stars... but for the FRAGRANCE! Why oh why did you have to put a smelly old fragrance in this Neutrogena! It does nothing for skin health, they're known skin irritants, and we're bombarded by enough fragrances in our lives already! Ditch the fragrance Neutrogena, you know you should."
"IT WORKS! I have only used it for a week and a half and I noticed that my old darker spots are getting lighter and the newer pigmentation and freckles are almost fading...overall, my skin looks lighter or brighter and healthier...some old acne issues are also dissipating, disappearing... my skin burnt a little the first two days and, yes, sometimes it flakes but it is part of the process... PLEASE make an unscented version! the scent makes my eyes water! besides the scent is just too strong...it resembles another very good quality product 4 Stars because of scent... NONETHELESS, I am glad i purchased it because it works for my olive/yellow tone skin..."
"At last... an affordable skin corrector that works! I've been using a more expensive product( from the pricey department store's makeup counter for years, yet never noticed any kind of improvement. I've used Neutrogena products off and on for years (facial soaps and moisturizers), on an impulse I decided to try the Rapid Tone Repair and VIOLA, in only a few days I've seen noticeable lightening to my dark spots. I would have given this product a five star rating, if it weren't for the scent...I find it too strong and offensive. Unscented would be my preference."
Best Dark Spot Corrector I have used! I have been using this product for about a month now and it is amazing! I have used many other products and have found this one to be the most useful. It has faded my dark spots faster and more effectively than I thought possible. Definitely a recommended product!
Even skin tone and less brown spots I love this product I am also using tone correcting day and night creams ..after one week of applying spot correcter my skin burns and tingles now for a minute and gets flaky and if I don't put moisturizer right away after washing my face I would feel super stretched and dry and I never had dry skin! Is this normal since my skin has improved dramatically ..burning bothers me but if it's normal then it's worth it !
"Does what it says! Clearly, my skin has shown a great improvement in tone and overall clarity. I've been using this product for about three weeks and my skin looks definitely clearer, spots have faded and no irritation. Thank you Neutrogena!"
Spot Remover have to use 2 week before I now if works

Even Skin Tone And Less Brown Spots I love this product I am also using tone correcting day and night creams ..after one week of applying spot correcter my skin burns and tingles now for a minute and gets flaky and if I don't put moisturizer right away after washing my face I would feel super stretched and dry and I never had dry skin! Is this normal since my skin has improved dramatically ..burning bothers me but if it's normal then it's worth it !
"At Last... an affordable skin corrector that works! I've been using a more expensive product( from the pricey department store's makeup counter for years, yet never noticed any kind of improvement. I've used Neutrogena products off and on for years (facial soaps and moisturizers), on an impulse I decided to try the Rapid Tone Repair and VIOLA, in only a few days I've seen noticeable lightening to my dark spots. I would have given this product a five star rating, if it weren't for the scent...I find it too strong and offensive. Unscented would be my preference."
"It Works! I have only used it for a week and a half and I noticed that my old darker spots are getting lighter and the newer pigmentation and freckles are almost fading...overall, my skin looks lighter or brighter and healthier...some old acne issues are also dissipating, disappearing... my skin burnt a little the first two days and, yes, sometimes it flakes but it is part of the process... PLEASE make an unscented version! the scent makes my eyes water! besides the scent is just too strong...it resembles another very good quality product 4 Stars because of scent... NONETHELESS, I am glad i purchased it because it works for my olive/yellow tone skin..."
"Love This Stuff! I am absolutely in love with this product. I noticed a difference in my skin within the first week. It smells great, goes on smooth, is not oily at all and best of all leaves my face feeling fabulous! I am 35 and have a few small brown spots on my face and wanted to start something right away. I am so glad I started with this product. I have already noticed a fading of my brown spots. I highly recommend this item you will not be disappointed."
"Won't go without it I've been using this for about a month and I refuse to live without it. This product lightens ALL dark marks. I've used this for old burn marks that I've had for years. They all look so much better. I use this for mosquito bite scars. I use this for scratches that didn't fade enough. After 3 or 4 days they are so much lighter. I am trying my best to have perfect skin all over. oddly enough the dark spots on my face are fading more slowly, but they are fading. I even use this every night on my dark knees and my knees look so much better. I also use this on my hips to even out a few small stretch marks and darker skin in that area. My hips look a lot more even toned. I feel much better wearing shorts and skirts. I am so close to having even skin all over. I'm thinking 4 more weeks. After my shower (before moisturizing) I literally take this product and apply it to every mark/uneven area. I've been having this scratch on my leg for years. I thought it wouldn't fade. After four days of treating it I can barely see the scratch enough to even treat it. I now purchase this product two at a time."
Great Product II really like this stuff. I have seem some slight difference with dark spot and it feels great on your face.
"So happy at the results! I'm a 51 year old that's not ready to look like it. I have had freckles all my life so the spot thing was not a concern for me. Then one snowy night I slipped on the ice and did a face plant. What a mess, everything healed up well but left nasty scars like road rash. Not even heavy foundation was working, you could still see the scaring. After searching the Internet and trying several products I found reviews for this product. Braving a snow storm, I emediately drove to the closest store that carried it. Seriously! The second day I saw a difference! I have been using it for 5 days now and the scaring hardly noticeable. Even my freckles have faded. My skin hasn't been this smooth and firm in years. A light coat of foundation and I look great. For the price you can't loose. Just wished it came in a bigger tube. My next question would be what other products should I use to go with the corrector I was thinking about trying the eye firming cream and would also like to try a moisturizer as well as. Any suggestions"
Got rid of red marks in 3 days I love this product. I had red marks on my face that would not go away. Piling concealer on was not helpful.I used this product and they were gone in 3 days. I used a competitors product for the previous month. Buy this!
1 Spot remover This has worked faster and better than any other product I have used. This is a product I will continue to use. No more searching.
"Disappears in an instant, works all day I love this product and have used it exclusively for years. It goes on smoothly and easily and absorbs into skin right away with no greasy feel. I get compliments on my complexion all the time. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
good Comply with what was promised
"Drinking the kool-aid..... I have been researching different lines for products that would make my skin look as great as I knew it could. Neutrogena has come through big time! I have been using the Rapid Tone Repair dark spot corrector (morning and night) for almost four weeks and my post-acne blemishes are fading nicely! Seriously, my skin is looking more even toned, bright and clear than it has in years.......I am feeling so much better about myself! I use the Hydro Boost moisturizer as well (also morning and night), and I noticed an immediate plumping of my skin. I don't have wrinkles yet, but when your skin is tired and thirsty, an awesome moisturizer like this water gel makes a big difference! I am not trying to look 25 (I'm 38) and have no problem aging......I just want to look my best!"
"Pleasantly Surprised I am surprised at how much nicer my skin looks and feels after using this product for a while. Not only does my skin tone look more even, but it's actually almost gotten rid of my breakouts completely. I originally purchased this in hopes of getting rid of my dark spots and after 2 weeks I am finally starting to see a bit of fading. There is no skin creme out there that will magically fade dark spots in a week, the skin doesn't work that way. It needs time to heal and shed the dead layers. This will help speed up the process and it smells amazing! It does dry out the skin a bit, but its supposed to so make sure you moisturize as well!"
"Thank you, thank you, thank you! After spine surgery in August, I developed a staph infection on my cheek that looked like really bad acne. Painful and, in my opinion, disfiguring. Two rounds of antibiotics did nothing that I could tell. Neither did acne washes, masks, creams. Then my mom suggested your Dark Spot Corrector. I started using it in mid-November and within a week or two could see some improvement. After a month, I could wear my hair back again. Now, after more than three months, I only have a few scars left and they're not all that noticeable. All I can say is a heartfelt THANK YOU for giving me my face back."
A miracle! I've purchased expensive products in an attempt to eliminate dark spots. After endless disappointments and money wasted.. It seemed like nothing would work. Then by some miracle I decided to give this product a try! The bottle stated Rapid tone and spot corrector This product backs that claim and the amazing results are proof. I am more than pleased. When they say rapid they mean results a solution to uneven tone and dark spots thank you Nutragina this product is a Gods sent
"Finally A product that works!!! So for the past 3 years I have suffered from annoying dark spots. I blame a battle with adult acne. I have tried numerous expensive products (Clinique, Proactiv, fade creams) and several trips to my dermatologist and nothing has workedI mean nothing. Not even a slight difference. I decided to try neutrogena and I use the dark spot corrector and the night cream. The results one month in are incredible. My spots are barely noticeable now. Great product at an affordable price!!"
"Best Dark Spot Corrector EVER! Thank you for bringing this back! I don't wear make up and normally have clear skin. After turning 30 I've noticed my skin doesn't bounce back after breakouts. I've been looking for a replacement since this was discontinued 2-3 yrs ago. Works even quicker and doesn't irritate at all. My search is finally over since this is the only thing that fades dark spots (post breakout)without making me break out even more. Thank you, again! My favorite product. It works!!!!!"
"Works wonders if used as directed!! Once I started using this product my skin had to get used to it and when I say get used to it I mean it peeled for a week or two, but I think that means it was working!! And that it did! After about 3 weeks I received a compliment that my skin was brighter and more beautiful!! So iif one has dark spots or post acne discolorations this is the product to buy!"
"It really works! I can't believe this product works so fast. In just a few days I could see the spots fade away. I am so impressed that I bought two more packages. On line I haven't been able to find the Dark Spot Corrector, but just a similar product. I just found this last week. Please don't discontinue it. There are many of us who need this product. I am even using this on my hands. It works great!"
"Turn Back Time Riding through the desert with cowboys, and jumping waves with my brothers on jetskis all ended up on my face. I ravaged the internet in search of resolve, then turned to Neutrogena. Sure enough, in less than the week warranted, my skin tones began to even out, fine and deep wrinkles reduced. Wow! Who'd 'a thought Thanks Neutrogena...a lot!"
Best Skin Ever Using Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream has saved my skin from sunburn and discolorations and has it looking great! I love this product. It goes on smooth and is non-greasy or heavy! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"This stuff really works! At the age of 47, my skin is remarkably wrinkle-free- but in the last couple of years my aging has really started to show with age spots that have been getting more numerous, larger and darker. After only TWO WEEKS of using Rapid Tone Repair Dark Spot Corrector my skin has really cleared up. The small spots are gone, and the larger spots are much smaller and lighter. Fantastic!"
"Love this Product! I love this product! I could see a difference almost immediately. My skin looks so much better. It was looking so dry, red, dull and rough. I could hardly stand to look in the mirror before I put on my makeup. Now, my skin looks just as good without any makeup! Even the dark spots are fading! Love all the Neutrogenia products I have tried."
"The spots are gone!!!! In just two days, 2 DAYS ONLY, the majority of my facial dark spots were gone. This product is sensational!"
"It really does work! I've been using retina-a/retinols, and vit. C for years, plus hyaluronic acid, so I wasn't expecting much, but liked that this was 3-in-one product, so I tried it. It's better than I could have imagined! I'm very happy with it. My dark spots are almost gone. They are seriously faded. Try it, it works! Great product."
Fast Results I just want to say I used this product and seen result the very next day. It has not even been a full 7 days and my dark spots are completely lightening up. I am very pleased with this product and I would def recommend it.
Noticed improvement overnight! The products says I should notice a difference within a week. To my surprise I noticed the lessening of dark spots the first morning after wearing it to bed! So happy to find something effective that isn't as expensive as all the brands you'll find in department stores.
"Amazing Honestly, after only one application, I could actually notice a difference! By the end of the week, I will probably see a complete transformation at this rate. This apparently does exactly what it was meant to do."
Works great on age spots I really was very impressed how well this product worked on my age spots. Work better than the cream my dermatologist gave me. I only wish they created a larger container for the price
"ingredients Hi, how many percent of retinol and vitamin C in this product I love it and i want to know it more"
Excellent product Love this
"GREAT HYDRATION I USE OLAY REGENERIST DEEP HYDRATION REGENERATING CREAM EVERY NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING MY FACE IS SOFT AND AND STILL HYDRATED, OTHER CREAMS I USED, MY FACE WOULD BE VERY DRY THE NEXT MORNING. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
My dark spots are almost gone! I've been using a lot and expensive product but this Rapid Tone Repair dark spot corrector is really effective for me.
Works!! If you follow directions you will start to see results in a week.
It Actually Works! Like the others I have tried different products over the years with little improvement. But after two days I noticed an improvement in the dark spots. After two weeks they are so light you can hardly see them under make up. Amazing!
Wow Really Impressed I had some burn scars that were black in color from frost bite. No scar screams would touch it. I even tried lightening and brightening creams from expensive brands like Clinique and Estee Lauder. NONE touched them. Within TWO DAYS this stuff not only lightened them but the darkNess began to peel off and fresh new skin showed underneath. I've never bothered to write a review about anything but this was by far above and beyond what I expected especially from a product at a drug store. I don't know what this would do for age spots but if it works anything like what it did for my old burns then it's nothing short of a miracle!
# 1 Spot Remover This has worked faster and better than any other product I have used. This is a product I will continue to use. No more searching.

"Ugh - my hands! I thought this would help my hands that always dry out so easily - it says it's Burt's Bees Ultimate Care Hand Cream right on the tube, after all. It didn't. My hands ended up flaking peeling with this stuff. Other Burt's Bees hand creams have worked wonders for me, but not this."

"Not For Sensitive Skin I usually use the grape seed hand cream by Burts bees but wanted another for my office. Tried this and my hands broke out. My hands get very dry and are sensitive,usually to heavily scented hand creams and lotion. This stuff made my hands sting, itch, and I got little red bumps. Dont recommend if you have sensitive skin. Otherwise, Im sure it would be fine."

I've been using it for 3 days now and it does make my hands feel better for a while after putting it on, the ends of my fingers are still dry and flaky I'm hoping that with more use it will help more."

"Excellent This hand cream is by far the best that I've ever used. I'm a senior and have been through probably 100's of hand creams during my life and this one is the best. My hands have a tendency to be very dry and in some places I had fine cracks. Even after being in water such as washing dishes or cleaning the bathroom my hands still remain soft. At the beginning I used consistently every time my hands were in water but after a few weeks of use I no longer have to apply as frequently. I don't understand why this was given a bad review because this product does exactly what it's supposed to. I won't ever have to search for a hand cream that softens cutitles, heals, helps to prevent dryness as I've found it! You will be very pleased once you start using this cream. Yes, it is a little pricey BUT you only need a pencil eraser size for both hands. A little goes a long way. When I first started using I did use more but soon found that a smaller amount works just as well. I'm expecting this hand cream to last for approximately 3 or more momths with daily use of 2 to 3 times. Burt's bees Ultimate care hand cream healed the cracks and softened my cuticles which were so dry they would peel off like a scab. No more!"
"Bar None - Best Hand Cream EVER I work as a bar tender. My hands are constantly popping in and out of hot soapy water and drying out. They take a real beating. I used up my Ultimate Care Hand Cream and couldn't find it anywhere in stores so I resorted to Burt's Hand Salve. That was awful and did nothing. I resorted to other brands of lotion/hand cream. My hands got worse. I drove a half hour away to grab a bottle of my beloved Ultimare Care Hand Cream. Within 10 minutes of putting it on the rough scaley dry skin was gone. A previous reviewer said that it made her hands flake and peel... well, yeah! When you rub your hands your old dry skin will rub off. It even says on the back of the bottle that it helps exfoliate all your dead skin to reveal great soft skin underneath. Mind you, it doesn't burn, hurt, or ever feel gritty or greasy. It's my holy grail for my badly abused hands."
"Younger Looking I have been using this product for the last 5 yrs. When people find out I have a 30 year old son, they look at me thinking I had him when I was in my teens since I look much younger than 53. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Got cracked hands Love this stuff. I work in an environment that really dries out my hands, on top of my dry skin, that's a big problem. I've used other products that work for a while, but not consistently. This stuff Is amazing! I use it and everyone I work with uses it because of how well it works for me! We adore it."
"Excellent. Thanks. Excellent,fast shipping. Thank you."
Lovely scent and very smooth going on I recently fell and broke my ankle in three places. After surgery and cast removal my skin was very dry. I began using Burt's Bees Ultimate Hand Cream on my leg and foot and was amazed at how it moisturized my skin. I am very allergic to most scents and was so happy that this product has such a clean and subtle scent. I highly recommend it.
Excellent Hand Cream I do not like a lot of scent in my hand cream especially when I put it on before bed. This hand cream is virtually scent-free. This goes on nice and creamy but absorbs very quickly and moistures my hands nicely. I am really enjoying it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

It even says on the back of the bottle that it helps exfoliate all your dead skin to reveal great soft skin underneath. Mind you, it doesn't burn, hurt, or ever feel gritty or greasy. It's my holy grail for my badly abused hands."
"Fabulous Moisturizer ! I love in Alaska where the winter weather can be dehydrating and harsh at times. This product rocks it in the moisture category, and helps with those age lines and birthday wrinkles. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Another great hand cream, unlike others... I love this hand cream. It is super moisture for any dry hands. Use this in conjunction with the Shea Butter Hand Repair Cream. The baobab oil is nourishing for your skin. A little more costly than the Hand Repair Cream."
Good item Good item to moisturizer your hands. i loved it! Can't wait to try more of the lotion lines.
"wonderful product my whole family does use this product for our hands. yes, our hands need it more in winter months but actually we all have some n our cars, on our desk and in purses. we love it and it truly is an amazing product. thank you a lot"
Excellent Hand Cream I do not like a lot of scent in my hand cream; especially when I put it on before bed. This hand cream is virtually scent-free. This goes on nice and creamy but absorbs very quickly and moistures my hands nicely. I am really enjoying it.
very good hand cream very good hand cream
"Ocean Potion Sunless Tanning Lotion Product was a couple weeks late getting here. It has a nice smell, but the tan is very subtle (needs 2 or 3 applications), but very realistic."
"Glowing skin color I've use many brands of skin self tanners but most are expensive and leave a strange blotches color so imagine my surprise when these very affordable brand,I never heard of before,worked better than most name brands that cost 3x more!I had beautiful results by day two so I ordered 4 more and gave two to my momI am extremely happy with this product I say try it I think you'll like it...p.s.it is very easy on sensitive skin too."
I was really not impressed I pretty saddened by this product. I've used the product for a week now and I've broken out in so many pimiles! I usually get around 6-10 pimples a year. I am currently battling 9 on my face. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"NotTotally Effective Although I love the feeling of Total Effects on my skin, I don't think I look any younger. Maybe it's just that I look at my face every day so I don't see a difference, but maybe I was just hoping for miracles. I'll continue to use it as I like the feeling and smoothness, but I don't feel it's made me look younger. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Thought I was ready to use anti-age product First of all, I am 32 years of age, never smoke, never been drinking, every body say I look young, I never use anti-age product before so I thought maybe It was time. I use it for a week, but it give me so much pimples that I had to stop using it. Even if I'm 32, don't think my skin is enough mature to use anti-age product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Excellent Product My wife was using this product and that's how I got started with using it. It goes on smooth and absorbs into the skin quickly. I usually don't need lotion on my face the rest of the day. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Unfortunately I suffer from Perioral Dermatitis flare ups, and unfortunately after using this product once- my skin was red and hot. I had to wash it off right away, unfortunately the skin infection still flared up some :( I can't blame the product though, my skin is sensitive to almost every cream I've tried in the last few years :( This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Total Effects no substitution I have used Olay products since I was a teenager. For the past few years, I used Olay Definity and LOVED it. After it was discontinued, I was told to that Olay Total Effects was a good substitute. There's no comparison. Total Effects is greasy and never absorbs into my skin. By the end of the day, even my bangs are dripping oil. Bring back Definity!!!!"
"Didn't live up to their claims I was very excited to try this product since it's not even in stores yet! Also I am very skeptical about these anti aging creams! I applied the product everyday but after 4 weeks, I didn't notice any real significant difference! I'm not really surprised because I've never had any success with these types of creams! So in my opinion I would not buy this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Skin reaction I was quite excited to try this product as I have heard great things. I used it for a few days and then ended up having a skin reaction. It was unfortunate. I gave this product a 1 out of 5 just because of that. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Mosturizer I have been using the cream for about a week now and it has make my skin break out! I am sure it is the cream, since I have not changed my diet and I rarely ever even get so much as one pimple. I stopped using the cream and my skin went back to normal. However, it was helping reduce the look of pores and fine lines. Unfortunately the side effect made it unusable. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Started out well... I loved this moisturizer the first couple weeks but into the third week I started to break out and it just kept getting worse. My skin is sensitive and I do have problems trying new creams. Some block poores worse than others so i guess this one does too. If you don't have acne prone skin you might be fine but if you have sensitive skin, I don't recommend this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Ewww you Stink I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Ant-Aging Moisturizer smell awful. Having to wear it was unbearable for me. I cannot attest to how it preforms as I could not complete the time required. I would however try the unscented version. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"A disapointment I honestly only used the Total Effects 7 in 1 moisturizer once. The smell made me gag. The moisturizer was incredibly greasy and I woke up the next morning and had broken out. I really wish I could give this a better review. But for me this just did not do it for me. I have had good experiences with Olay in the past, but the products I have used must have been a different scent or scent free. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not For Me I was eager to try the Olay total effects lotion. Unfortunately, my sensitive skin was not as eager to be introduced to this product. I tried applying it at several different times, however the reaction was consistent I got a rash. So, no Olay Total Effects for me :( This review was collected as part of a promotion."
too much perfume I think this product has too much perfume scent in it for me. I prefer a moisturizer that is unscented or a light scent. The scent in this product was so overpowering for me. The day after I tried this product my face broke out which that never happens! I think it had something to do with the high scent in the product. I would recommend this to others only if they like something smelly. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Love it!!! The whole Regenerist line is great . Haven't tried them all due to the cost but the ones I've tried I really love and would refer to friends! Would love to win to sample more products!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"not impressed I received this sample, which i was looking forward to try because i like Olay's products!! I am very disappointed as i haven't seen no changes at all. My lines are all the same ......I even did it for 10 days because after 7 days, i didn't see no difference.... It does make you skin feel hydrated and soft. That's pretty much it! So , honest opinion, don't spend your money on this product if you want results! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Not my favorite Well I was excited to try this product but sadly I had a bad reaction to it broke out in a bad rash! So I had to stop using it :( I have never had issues in the past with Olay products I will still purchase from the brand but not this particular product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Just not for me... I've avoided using Olay products for years as I have combination skin and, regardless of the type, it always seems to work well at first but then my face gets an oily sheen. It's unfortunate, as I'd love to be able to use a more affordably-priced facial moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay anti aging lotion This lotion has a lot of promise, it's light weight feels great and smells great. It is non greasy and it's small size is easy to fit in your purse. How ever it really irritated my skin making me break out with horrible painful pimples so I had to discontinue use. I feel like this would be great for someone with less sensitive skin such as myself. I only gave it one start because personally it didn't work for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Bad Reaction to Olay Total Effects I was so excited to use this. I tried the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer as a night cream as I have to use my day creams for my Rosacea. I woke up and my face was swollen. I've never had a cream do that to my face. Under my eyes and cheeks were very puffy. I was so looking forward to using this product and seeing a difference. :( I hope others have success with this and look forward to reading their reviews on BzzAgent. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Does not do what it claims to do I've been using this product for a month now. I see no signs of improvement. This product is expensive. I've used other products that have worked much better. But I trusted Olay. I will never buy this particular product again. Maybe I should have tried another type of Olay, but I can't afford the price. Thank You."
Anti-Aging Rash OLAY Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Is not for my sensitive face. I tried it off and on for a week. And every time I broke out in a rash:( And my sun spots got darker :( :( Unfortunately I just have sensitive skin and should've know better then to try something new. But I would like to find something one day that won't hurt my face. Thanks for the sample. And I'll past on the little I have left to a friend to see if they like it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Unimpressed so far As i said in the Bzz Report earlier, i tried this product for over a week, but I'm not seeing the promised effects in the advertising. i have had breakouts since I began using it and at my age, this is really not acceptable. I am ceasing the use of the sample and going back to my previous moisturizer. I expected a different result and am disappointed. This won't stop me from trying new moisturizers in the future. I think that this is just a bad trial for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Not for me I've had the opportunity to try a few great campaigns from BzzAgent and they have all been positive. This is the first one I'm not happy with. Unfortunately I had a bad reaction to the product ( rash and swelling) and I can't recommend it to anyone. Obviously pictures are not a good idea. I know Olay is a very popular brand so I am sure this is not the norm and obviously my skin does not agree with the product. I have given it 1 star but only because it can't be blank. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Did not work for me :( Unfortunately this product did nothing for me :(. Wrinkles and age spots are not my problem but I would love to have brighter more even skin with smaller pores. For me, I saw no difference in my skin and family noted the same thing. I am not sure if this is a product recommended for oily skin (which is what I have) but although it was a decent moisturizer as I was able to use it under my make-up, the moisturizer I was using before works better and leaves my skin feeling fresher. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"feels very expensive!! I have had the very expensive and always come back to Olay, the product is a five star in my book. The quality is wonderful and so are the results. I now have my daughter in law hooked. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Breaking out I was asked to test Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer This product has a very nice fragrance to it. It is a little strong. My skin doesn't feel very soft after and within a couple uses I started to break out. I am not typically one to get many pimples however after trying this product they were appearing everywhere. I discontinued using it after 4 days. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Not so nice odor. I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer had a faint smell of un-burnt tobacco. I was unable to continue using this product because of this odor, as it was applied to my face. I cannot attest to its claims of being able to fight the seven signs of aging, such as fine lines , age spots or uneven skin tone. I wish it had a more pleasing odor. I was however happy to be able to try this product for free. I have been looking for something to help fight signs of aging. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Still not sure This product would be a great for someone with normal to oily skin or great for my skin if it were summer. This dried out my skin so much that I had to stop using it so I can't give a review on anything this product is claiming to do. It smells great and it absorbs good it just doesn't have the amount of moisture my skin needs during the cold winter months. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Not what I was hoping for. I think Oil of Olay Total effects 7 in 1 Anti aging moisturizer is not for everyone. I loved the smell and the texture of this product but I could not stand it after 2 hours on my face. Might be my skin type but it made my face and neck extremely oily, I would have to wash my face or use a tissue to mop up the oils. My skin is already on the oily side and I don't think I was compatible for this product, Although the bottle itself is easy to use and convenient It just wasn't meant to be. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Bad breakouts This product seemed great at first I had super soft mosturized skin but within a week I had such a bad breakout from it that I had to stop using it. I had very large painful boil like acne that is taking forever to get to clear up. I washed my face very well before each application but this stuff seemed to trap in any sweat and clogged my pours. It also gave me a shiny look which is surprising since I have naturally dry skin and slight eczema. I had high hopes for this product but was extremely disappointed. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Don't like it I have always used iLike for my skin care needs but it has a very high price point. I was excited to try Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I gave it 2 weeks to see how my skin would react and see if those fine lines would go away! I am sorely disappointed. It did not live up to my expectations. My crows feet are growing like crazy. My freckles are showing like never before. I am using more concealer than ever before. I broke with tons of acne. I will say it had a nice feel going on. It had great texture. Bottom line, not my favourite product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"made me break out So, I was excited to try the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer that I received for free for testing purposes. It felt nice when applied, went on smooth absorbed wonderfully! However, it smelled very fragrant (which gave me an almost instant headache), broke me out terribly and made my skin itch :( I would like to see Olay work towards more fragrance free products (as fragrance is very irritating to skin! and can also cause headaches)... I discontinued use right away, so I cannot state if what it claims is true. GotItFree This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay yes but not this one I was so happy to test Olay cause i'm a daily user of their products. But quickly i found out i really hate this cream. It Smell awful and did absolutely nothing good on my skin. The bottle is too small to test long enough i think. i'm very very sad to give a negative point of view but i have to be honest because i respect Olay a lot. I just wish they will consider our opinion and ameliorate the Moisturizer before selling it This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I think this product is an average moisturizer and nothing more. After trying it for four weeks and being excited to minimize fine lines and restoring firmness, I was extremely disappointed that it did nothing more than any other moisturizer out there would. The cream does go on smoothly, but I just couldn't get past the smell of it! I guess my hopes were too high going into the project and I believed their claims. I seriously could not notice any difference after the four week trial. I wouldn't waste my money on this one! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A little disappointed I was expecting a little more from this product. I usually use an Olay face wash, so I thought I'd be pleased with this lotion. I found it to be very greasy and it caused both my husband (yes, he tried it too lol) and I to break out. I also got a red rash over parts of my face that I used it on. Neither of us have overly sensitive skin and I can't remember the last time I got a pimple, until now! In the end, neither of us would buy this in the future and we'll stick to what we're currently using until something better comes along. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"my face is smooth, soft and hydrated! My face was getting dry flaky and looking old...my mother told me about this line from Olay and I started right away. It's only been 1 week and I look younger and no more flaky face!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not for me Unfortunately after having to pick this up at the Purolator office, and finding out later that I could have called in to arrange a second delivery, I was already a bit put out. But I washed my face for bed and tried this Olay cream. The following morning I work up with two pimples and a dry patch on my chin. I tried a second night, using some hydrating serum and I still woke up with dry patches. So if you have dehydrated skin this won't be the formula for you. I'm always willing to try new things but in this case, it wasn't a match. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"No difference I think that the trial sized bottle was too small to give me enough time to notice a difference. I used the entire bottle, once daily for a week. I did not notice a difference in my skin. I was hoping it would help with the wrinkles around my eyes and the two small age spots. Nothing. I did find the scent a little too strong. Maybe if I had two trial sized bottles or one larger one, I would have noticed a difference at the end of the bottle This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Didn't make a difference for me... I have been trying out the Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, but I haven't seen any changes at all. Maybe it is just because I am in my early 30's and haven't aged yet LoL. While I cannot speak to the product's ability to do as it advertises... I would like to say that it most definitely goes on nicely and does not stay wet and greasy. However, I around the 5th day, I did start to break out from it. I will continue with this sample, so as not to waste it however, I have nothing positive to really say about it. Sorry. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not much of a difference. This product did not provide a lot of change for my skin type. The product has a smooth texture and a pleasant odour. I also liked that a single pump didn't release an excessive amount of product at each time. I am Asian and have naturally young looking skin with no significant wrinkles or fine lines. After four weeks of use, my skin was nicely moisturized, but not very changed with respect to age. So, probably not the best review for those who are interested in using, but certainly not a useful product for those who have a skin type like my own. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"High hopes but dissapointed I was really excited to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I am pushing 40 and am noticing the differences in my skin. More wrinkles, dark spots, sagging. I was looking for a product that could help so when I got the invitation into this campaign I jumped on it. It felt nice going on but that is where the positives stopped for me. I found my skin felt very greasy and there was alot of shine, not in a good way. Also, and this is an issue for me with alot of facial products, my face broke out within a couple days of using it. I had to stop. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Not for me I feel so bad about giving a bad Bzz report. Everything that I have participated in has been fantastic to date. When I was offered to participate in the Olay Total Effects Moisturizer campaign I was so excited! My face gets so dry in the winter and I was hoping that this product could help me. I only got to use it 3 days and my face broke out in sores. I have sensitive skin but I have never had such a reaction to a product that I have with this. I have given the rest of the bottle to a friend of mine to see how she reacts to the product. Its a shame to waste it. So far I haven't heard back from her. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"what you see is what you get Honestly did not notice any difference before or after using the product. It had a nice, pleasant scent at the beginning but gradually found it to be overpowering when using the product on a continuous basis. Yes it moisturized well was creamy smooth on application with no unpleasant after feel - you know how some products have some lingering tackiness or film But as for the anti-aging, I didn't see any changes in my appearance. Skin tone did not even out, age spots did not diminish. I guess the big factor was if someone commented on my face looking better but nobody did. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Not for me or my friends After I started getting massive breakouts after using the product for only a couple of days I figured it wasn't right for my skin type and wrote a review saying as much. I gave the almost full bottle to a friend with much drier skin than mine (who also happens to be about a decade and a half older than me) in the hopes that she would appreciate it more. She hasn't had a pimple in years but within a week of using this product she was having breakouts as bad as mine. Neither of us liked the smell either. I doubt either of us is ever going to use Olay products ever again. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"not see any results I am not to sure if I do not have enough skin problems to see a difference in my skin. I have been using the Olay Tiotal Effects 7 in one for more then 2 weeks and have not really seen any change in my skin. I still have fine lines, my pores seem the same size, I guess I did not really have age spots, my skin is not any brighter. I did break out the first week that I used the product. I personally do not like the smell (there is a fragrance free available) I do not think I would buy this product at this point but maybe is a few years. I would also buy the one with the SPF in it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay review Great packaging and convenient pump style dispenser. Fragrance is pleasing as well. That about sums up the positives for this product. I did not notice any changes to any of the listed benefits that were claimed. Upon review of the listed ingredients, I am puzzled as to how they can make any claims at all. Even from the perspective of using this product as a basic moisturizer, it does not stand up to my other skin care routine products. Thanks Bzz for the opportunity to try this out! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
love it! This product is the best ever.My skin feels so good.My skin's appearance is better.I know this is something I will definitely use every day.I also use the eye serum.Both are wonderful.Thank you Olay!
"My Olay Experience So this is my follow up post. I have been using Olay daily. The pros-it smells great. Just a very light fragrance that makes me want to use it daily. The cons however, it is greasy. I tried putting light amounts on and it felt wet to the touch after being on my skin for a bit in other words it didn't soak in very fast and I saw no visible difference to my skin. It is unfortunate as I love Olay body wash and other Olay products. I have to say this one is not something I would purchase again unless they could find a way to make it not so greasy. I am sorry, Olay but this one is a thumbs down. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Strong smell no dice I was really excited to try this product because I've had a lot of luck with Olay before, but the smell of this product just really set me off. I'm not extremely scent-sensitive, but the smell really reminded me of products my grandmother would wear, with that odd, off-floral, soapy scent. For an anti-aging product I thought this was a total misstep. Yet, I still tried for another two weeks to see if there were any interesting effects from the product, and I have to say it felt just like a regular, drug store moisturizer to me. Except with an unpleasant smell. So no, didn't really enjoy my time with this one. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I wish I received the fragrance-free one I wish I was sent the trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 fragrance-free as the one I received was heavily scented and not good for my skin at all :( Since the product will be released this February to purchase, I may pick up a trial size of the fragrance-free formula to test out (but I'm a little wary...) The original one I would not recommend at all for someone with sensitivities/sensitive skin. I gave it one star because it felt very nice when applied, absorbed well and didn't leave that nasty greasy feel. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not for me :( I was very hopeful for this moisturizer to be IT.... unfortunately, my face decided otherwise! I have very sensitive and mega dry skin. This moisturizer was ok on the first day, but by the end of the second day, my face was blotchy, red and I even had a bit of excema flair up. I stopped using it after that :( I'm sure Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer worked wonder for many, but for me it was a total failure. :( I did like that the product did not have a strong perfume, it was easy to apply and was absorbed quickly by my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"There are better, less expensive products out there. Well, I gave the Olay Total effects 7 in 1 face cream numerous trys, and also tried not using it for a few days in between applications, and still, I get all oily and break out in acne and red dots (it looks like I developed the chicken pox) on my face. The cream also makes my face and neck feel like pins and needles are in it after a few applications. I use a fair bit of make up, so I was very excited to be given the chance to try out a new skin care product that promised to reduce lines and wrinkles, reduce redness and make me look more awake and fresh. Instead Olay total effects 7 in 1 cream made any lines and wrinkles I do have, more prominent, made my face super oily so I would have to apply more touch ups throughout the day, and just made my face feel and look terrible. Olay Total effects 7 in 1 anti aging cream, was definitely made for a specific skin type one I do not have. I would not recommended this to anyone with even mild oily skin, or sensitive skin, based on what it did to me. All said and done, this anti aging cream from Olay, fell short on every single on of its claims, and there are better, less expensive products on the market that do 1000 times better job than Olay total effects 7 in 1. I'm thankful I was given the opportunity to try it out from bzzagent.com, but will never purchase it on my own. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Disappointed! I tried Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, which claims skin can look up to 10 years younger in one month. The 7 effects are: 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles 2. Evens skin tone appearance 3. Enhances brightness 4. Minimizes the look of pores 5. Visibly reduces age spots 6. Restores firmness 7. Replenishes moisture It did a decent job moisturizing and it might have increased the firmness (though there was no obvious difference). However, unfortunately I did not see any difference in the fine lines on my face. In fact I didnt really see much change in my skin at all. Im in my early 30s and think it might be better suited for older individuals. It didnt even out my skin tone, it didnt make my skin brighter or reduce age spots. I also had a break out problem and a minor rash during the time I was testing this product. My skin prior to starting this moisturizer was pretty clear so that was very disappointing. I have very sensitive skin, so there was likely an ingredient in this moisturizer that did not agree with me. Overall I would consider this product an average moisturizer, a less than average anti-age skincare solution, and likely not suitable for those with sensitive skin. Im very disappointed, but I will be going back to my regular moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not impressed I was really looking forward to trying this cream as I always see it on the store shelves and I often wanted to buy it and try it. After getting my free sample I am glad I haven't. This cream is definitely not for me. I liked the way it went on my face. It made my face feel smooth and has a nice scent however it left horrible white marks all over. I had cream on my neck, in my eyebrows and on my cheeks. It dried up so quickly and I hadn't even noticed until someone pointed it out to me. I was embarrassed to say the least. I am guessing my dry skin is not one for this cream. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer was not for me ... I was excited to try this because I really was in need of a new moisturizer - and I'm in my 40's and starting to really think about anti-aging products. I have very sensitive skin and fragrance-free and sunscreen are both important to me - and this product claims both. The first day I used it, I was satisfied - it felt good on my skin. I can say it seems to have a slightly pinky tinge to it, and I would say it did have a light scent - maybe they didn't add anything specifically for fragrance, but it does have a mild scent nonetheless. I used it morning, night and morning again, but by the 2nd night I noticed my face was starting to break out. The only change in my life was the moisturizer, so I stopped using it. I waited about 2 weeks for my skin to heal and get back to a healthy state, and tried again. I wanted to see if it was the Olay Total Effects, or just a coincidence. Unfortunately, the same thing happened but in less time. I stopped using it at this point. I can say it has a great feel and texture (not too thick and not too thin) and the scent really is very mild. I'm not a fan of the light pink colour of it, but that's just personal preference (I'm used to white creams I guess!). I would say if you have sensitive skin, stay clear.

"Didn't see 7 effects I was very excited to try this product as it claimed to do so much!! I had just gotten home from Mexico and my skin needed some TLC after being in the sun. I'm sad to say Olay 7 effects was not effective for me. I have used it for 4 weeks now with no change in my skin. It may have replenished the moisture to my face, but I found my face to be oily after its been on for a while. I also found I broke out with some white heads on my face as well. This is not at all what I expected from Olay 7 effects and I am sorry to say this is not a product that I would recommend to my friends and family or buy when it is available. This just is not the product for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My experience with this product I have given this product a good try before writing this as I know it may take time to see the results. The cream absorbed nicely into the skin without making it greasy, but I didn't see any improvement in my skin regarding the 7 signs of aging. In fact, I got lots of clogged pores on my face at the end of my experience, so I had to stop using the cream, and my face got better in a few days. I am sure the pores were not hormone or food related. It almost felt like it was either building up in my skin or got it irritated. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me at all. However I would use this product as a day moisturizer, and I would say it's comparable with any other moisturizer on the market, just not a miracle one.

If you like lemon frosting You will LOVE this lotion. I smile every time I put it on.
"This product really kept my winter face happy. This product really helped keep my skin moisturized in the winter months. I used it morning and night with good results. It's a little heavy for warmer weather though, with my skin type anyway. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
very true to the name : sculpting cream I really liked this product easy to use its creamy texture blended into my skin and it quickly sunk in leaving my skin soft and smooth in the morning it was well worth money spent I would us this product forever This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Overpowering Scent I was very disappointed in this product because it is very heavily scented. I used it for approximately one week and had to discontinue using it as it wreaked havoc on my skin. I do not normally have sensitive skin and have used a large variety of skin care products without issues. I let my skin clear up and tried using it again and experienced the same breakouts/redness as previously so I am certain this product was the cause of my skin problems. I will say I did really like the texture of the lotion and the packaging as well. Unfortunately because I only used it for such a short time I can't comment on any of it's 7 anti-aging claims. I know this product comes in an unscented version and I will likely try that one in the future with hopes I just reacted to the added scent. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"great but comedogenic My sample has run out..and here is my review.I have this product an honest try and this so what Ive experienced.Red,raw cystic acne and whiteheads...something I've never experienced since I was a teen.There was zero improvment in my skin,in vs t the acne and redness obviously would outshine any small cosmentic improvment in my skin.Unfortunately I am maybe one of the 1-5 that I think cannot use this product.I've buzzed about the product to others,but it's hard to be glowingly positive about a product that literally shows its damage to my face.Ive had my bzz score go down because what's expected is a positive review.I cannot say ANYTHING about this product other than 100 negative.I suspect it will take a few months for my skin to return to normal.I want to add the lack of information,handouts etc...or the fact this product is not on the market is another negative that cannot be overlooked.I wonder if there's many of us too embarassed bad that the stuff is horrid,and therefore all ones sees is glowing reportsI'd rather not have fee product to try than not be honest.This is the WORST facial product I have ever used.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer Thank you for sending my trial version of Olay Effect 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I found the product easy to apply, with a refreshing scent. I liked the fact that it has a slight cover-up feature that did reduce to some degree the look of age spots , uneven skin tones and freckles. This cover up feature also did not clog pores or highlight wrinkles like foundation does. But once I washed it off, my face appeared the same. As with most moisturizers, using it on a daily basis did make my skin feel smoother. To confidently say that it will provide all of it's promises would be a lie. Having a one week trial, when it states that it will make your skin appear younger in 4 weeks makes it impossible to either agree or disagree with this claim. Before considering a purchase of this product I would first like to know if there is a regiment that needs to be followed using other Olay products for best results or if the use of this product alone will accomplishment positive results. Also, if there are actual product users, I would like to hear from them. Good or bad, all comments will hopefully lead me to the truth. Overall however, I find that being able to try a product of any type is a positive thing. One will never know unless they try right This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Sticky and Unpleasant I was very excited to try this because I've always liked other Olay products. What a disappointment! The first time I put it on my face I wound up washing it off within an hour because it made my face feel uncomfortably tight and sticky. Today just tried it on my neck and chest and as soon as I'm done writing this I will go and wash it off for the same reasons. Would not recommend this product.
"I usually love OLAY products. Without hesitation, I purchased I gave this a try. I use OLAY soaps in my daily routine and I have never been disappointed. I have been using this product for over a week now and my face has gotten so dry. I do struggle with combination skin, but this has not helped in the slightest. I have even felt a slight stinging feeling when applying the moisturizer. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I am beyond disappointed."
"Olay Total Effects I tried Olay Total Effects and unfortunately it did not work well at all with my skin. On the initial application I thought it was an ok lotion. It was light and absorbed quickly and did not leave me feeling greasy. It left my skin smooth and seemed to be quite nice. The scent was a bit over powering but livable. After applying it on the second day, I felt a bit tingly and itchy but thought nothing of it as I react the same way to my usual brand of anti-aging moisturizer. However, by mid-day I had begun to break out in small pimples all over my forehead. I am not prone to acne and never have been(not even as a teen). Regardless, I carried on and tried using Olay total effects for one more day. The next morning I had to wash it off about an hour after using it because my skin felt terrible. I'm not sure if it's the perfume or if this product just has really strong anti-aging ingredients but it was too much for my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Broke Me Out :( I really wanted to like this product. I am in my early 30s and am taking my skin care very seriously. I heard all the great things people say about Olay and how these products compare to high-end department store products so I was so excited to try this out from BzzAgent. The texture of the cream is very light and my dry skin and provided just the right amount of moisture that it needed. It did not feel heavy at all. However, the next day, I noticed some red bumps on my face. Thinking it was some acne spots, I carried on with the product however it came to the point where I was certain that this product was breaking my out so I had to stop. Instead of wasting the sample, I gave this to my mom to use. She has been a long-time Olay user with no issues and this product is no different. I am disappointed that I wasn't able to try this product out longer and give it a fair shot. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"One of the dumbest tag lines ever Product feels greasy, and the promise of luminous 20-something skin just doesn't materialize. I think DNA has more to do with the results than this poorly formulated cream."
"It is No effect rather than Total effects I was waiting for long time to try this product which was recommended by a friend who tried it. I cannot feel any good change. The pores looks wider , skin tone is much more uneven, no renewal or exfoliation. feels sticky, smelly and shiny. I tried much better and cheaper skin products of natural origin that gives wonderful effects within couple of days of use. I am disappointed because I expected more from a well-known brand like Olay. I am returning it."
"Too light for me to use As a member of BzzAgent I have had the opportunity to test some really good products-One of such products I have tested in the past is the Pantene BB Creme, I really love this product because it works so well for my hair and I am glad I discovered it through the BzzAgent platform. When I was selected to test Olay Total Effects Anti Aging Moisturizer I was filled with great expectations, hoping that this moisturizer would be another amazing discovery. When my product sample arrived I was quite disappointed because I was sent a sample that was way too light for my skin tone. I do not know how this happened because I selected the darkest shade in the pre-selection survey. I considered using this moisturizer at night as a night cream but then I would have had to use another moisturizer during the day and as such would not be able to validate the claims of the Olay moisturizer. I will be offering this moisturizer to a friend. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Luminous!!!! I have found that by using this my skin has a healthy glow and is so soft !! I always receive compliments on how fresh and bright my skin is!!! I have told everyone about this great product!!! Thanks OLAY11 This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"So excited to try this! I was twittering with excitement to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer from the moment I heard about it. My skin has begun to show signs of aging and with my upcoming wedding I was trying to look and feel my very best. An age spot or two have emerged and the fine lines were beginning to deepen. These were high on the lists of this new product. My super sensitive skin was generally okay with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, no small feat. Each day I would wash my skin and apply the product, waiting anxiously for the promised results...and each day I was disappointed. I was hesitant to write this review as I like Olay's products and love being a BzzAgent but I do believe in honesty. I was so disappointed in this product and the lack of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer's claims to be true that I must give it a 0 out of 5, if I could. After a couple of weeks, it started to cause some small pimples, dry spots and redness. I would actually recommend that people not use this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"i am disappointed I was very excited to try the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer because of all the boasted benefits but upon using it for several days, I'm sad to report that I had to discontinue using it. I don't want to give a negative review, but I cannot lie this product is not what I thought it would be. I like the packaging, the texture, and even the smell, but the product made my skin blotchy, and my forehead erupted in many raised pimple-like bumps! My slightly uneven skin tone looked worse than usual, but as soon as I stopped using the moisturizer, my skin went back to normal the next day. No more blotchiness, or bumpy pimply things. I did not BZZ about this product because of my negative experience with it, and I threw out the rest of the Olay moisturizer. I am definitely disappointed with this product, and I'm glad I got to try it out for free versus buying it and hating it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Product did not work for me Olay total effects 7 in 1 claims to helps with the look of lines, pores, wrinkles and age spots are minimized, signs of damage also should be reduced and the skin is left hydrated, looking firmer, healthier, more radiant, even and smooth, this is definitely a product that promise a lot and I would have loved to react well to it but I had no chance. I tried this product for a couple of days but unfortunately, with my dry and sensitive skin, this product gave me more acne and my skin was becoming very red at the end of the day when I was removing my make up. When I used it, I mixed the Olay total effects 7 in 1 with my liquid foundation, I thought that it would be a good idea and would help me go faster in the morning since this is 7 products in 1 so I would not have to use all the other products to get to the same results. This product will not become part of my morning routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Worst product I have ever used This product got high rating by paying the reviewers. Please stay away from this product or else u will end up with a burnt skin or pimply face. The strong chemical used are not suitable for normal skin also.
"Not good for me This is the first time I have been disappointed with a product that I have tested for Bzzagent, so I'm not even sure where to begin. I just cannot say that I would buy the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I gave it one star to represent the first day I used this product. I was fairly happy, but as time went on, I became more and more disappointed, and eventually stopped using it. I didn't even get through the whole sample that was sent to me. Now, I guess I should describe my skin type, because maybe that is part of the reason I did not enjoy this product. I have very fair skin, and I tend to get very rosy cheeks, so I need a skin-calming moisturizer to reduce redness. I also have sensitive skin, which is dry in parts. I rarely get acne, but my skin easily becomes dry. I have some fine lines around my eyes which bother me a bit, but they aren't that bad. A bigger issue is puffiness around my eyes. The first day I tried the Olay 7 in one moisturizer, I was pleased by its consistency and the scent wasn't bad. I believe it has the classic Olay scent that I remember from my mom's Oil of Olay that she used when I was a child. If not, it is close. It absorbed really well too! My skin felt great, and not greasy at all. Unfortunately, after using the Olay 7 in 1 for three days, I noticed my rosy cheeks starting to become worse and worse. I'm not sure whether this product has sunscreen in it, and sunscreen is a huge factor in my choice of moisturizer. Whether it was from the fact that there is no sunscreen in this one, or a reaction, my cheeks kept getting redder and redder. I don't enjoy wearing a lot of make up on a daily basis, but it started getting so bad that I had to start covering it up with concealer and powder. Then I noticed my nose becoming shinier every day, so I had to wear more make up. Finally, I noticed a pimple on my nose. This was the last straw. I stopped using the moisturizer and switched back to my usual one, and in a few days these issues with my skin went away again. So, to sum up, this moisturizer did not work for me. It's definitely worth a try, but I am pretty particular about my skin because I really don't like to cover up with make up. I'd much rather have a calm, clear complexion in the first place. I would consider trying it again if in fact one with sunscreen included came on the market, but I'm not even certain if that would be enough. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Fragrance Free Anti-Aging Moisturizer I held off on giving my review because I wanted to make sure that I gave this product a good enough chance so I could do a good review. I was excited to receive this to try out. I was very hopeful that it would do what it claimed to do. Olay is a well known brand and I was positive that it would do wonders for my skin. My skin is starting to show fine lines and my laugh lines are getting deeper. My hopes with using this product was that it would decrease the fine lines and give me a more brighter complexion while moisturizing my skin. As I get older I find that my skin is getting more dry and I was looking for something that would hydrate my skin all day. When I first got this sample I used it for 2 days before my skin broke out. I didn't think that it was the olay so I continued to use it for several more days. I suffer from nodulocystic acne so after a couple days of using olay, the flare up of my acne was not getting better so I had to discontinue using the product. I decided that I would let my face clear up before I would try a second time to see if it was in fact the olay. Going back to trying it out though, I did notice a couple things. I felt that a little did not go a long way with olay. I had to use more then I thought I should have to get coverage. I found that it was not as thick as other moisturizers that I had tried so it was alarming to me that I had to use so much. I did like the smell of it though. It has a nice pleasant smell. Getting back to my second try of the olay. My face had cleared up after about a week and a half so I decided to try olay again. Within 1 day my face broke out in the cystic acne and I was back at square one. I was very unhappy that it broke my face out with huge acne again. I had to discontinue the product. I would have loved to continue but it just does not agree with my face. I realize that this product can't please everyone. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Turned the clock back a bit too much... I was excited to try this creme and tried it out for 2 weeks but unfortunately I broke out each time. I do not have acne prone skin so this was strange.

"Not good for my sensitive skin I may just have very sensitive skin, but this didn't work out well at all. I had to throw it out. It made me break out and made my face itchy.

Didn't like it..final answer Ok after finally making a decision I don't care for the product. It has made my face oily and have you feeling and not to mention I am now breaking out in acne.

Olay Total Effects I think Olay Total Effects is overly priced. I have used it and it doesn't do anything special. I Would not recommend this product to my friends and family. My skin has no difference. I have been using it 2 times a day for a week. It makes my skin feel oily after its applied. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Cheeks like Ol' Saint Nick... Say What Having used various formulations of Olay for the past 20 years I was really excited to try this new product. I have combination skin with some dry patches, ageing skin and occasionally a dash of dehydration. To qualify my review I think I need explain how I introduce a new skin care product to my regimen. I keep everything the same except for 1 product and I use it for a minimum of 2 weeks before I keep it in my routine. Experience has shown me that I will most often either see the beginning of benefits or any complications in that time. I approached the Total Effects in the same manner - it was the only product that I changed. I wasn't really worried, as I said, Olay products were a known entity. On the first few uses I noticed similar attributes - a distinctive scent, texture and how it applied. After about 4 days I noticed a change in my skin - namely more breakouts and red splotches. Which I found odd because pimples are not a problem I usually experience. Hormones Nope. Change in activities Nope. Other life changes Nope. Skin regime Huh... So I stopped using Olay for a couple of days to see if the skin continued to get worst or resolve itself. The red splotches disappeared and the zits started to recede. After about 5 days I decided to try it again - unfortunately the red splotches returned and I had to discontinue using the product. I hesitate to condemn the product - skin is a temperamental devil and I liked many aspects of the product - it's very emollient, the scent while fairly strong is not offensive. Unfortunately I can't tell you about the positive effects as I couldn't use it long enough to give a fair review. Maybe the fragrance-free would have resulted in a different result This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Olay Total Effects 7 Sorry to say but this product is a disappointment. The pump does not work well and the product itself makes me break out.

Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 Anti- Aging I think the chemicals in this product was to harsh for my skin. I would rather use a more pure product. That is good for me and my skin.

Results not so dramatic I tried the total effects 7 in 1 moisturizer and was not very impressed. It left my skin peeling and made me break out but without all the skin promises like reducing fine lines wrinkles etc. It had a nice light scent and applied very nicely and moisurized skin but it didn't meet my expectations or the benefits it touts.

Careful Not good for sensitive skin or oily skin. Broke out!!!
"Bring Back Sunscreen!!!! Why did you remove spf 15 option This was the only moisturizer with sunscreen which didn't aggravate my rosacea. Bring it back, please!!!!"
anti-aging... I wanted to try this product before I write up my review. I have been using this product for two weeks now and so far I have not seen any significant difference other than slightly smother skin. I will be doing another review when my four weeks are up and see if there is any changes. the moisturizer is light and was not greasy when applying. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

Total Effects container I have just recently started using the Total Effect 7in1 moisturizer. The product seems to be working good but I do not like the container it's in. It's a push top and it's uncontrollable. It only take a tiny bit for each area of the face but sometimes it squirts out way too much. I wish Olay would find a more dependable container for this product.
"It Doesn't work for me. Too Drying I used to use the original Oil of Olay years ago and I really liked it, but as I get older my skin is dryer and it seems I need a heavier moisturizer than the Total Effects 7 can offer. It's nice and light weight, very lightly scented, which I do like, but it absorbs fast and then my skin seems to feel even dryer for some reason This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great as a Moisturizer I think this a great product for moisturizer. However as an anti-aging cream it doesn't work. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and have noticed no change at all. It is a little oily but works great if you have dry skin. It also doesn't effect my sensitive skin. I would continue to use as a moisturizer as i like the way it works.

Total Effects Anti Aging Moisturizer This made my skin really dry and the wrinkles I'm trying to diminish worse! It's a nice light weight moisturizer but I am disappointed. It did tone my skin a little.
Olay Total Effects I tried Olay total effects and used it every night until the trial bottle was finished. I honestly did not see any difference in my wrinkles and fine lines. I didn't find that it made my skin feel any softer either. I was disappointed with this product as I have always had positive results with Olay products. I wouldn't buy this product.

"Behind the times Worked well with my combination skin. It did not leave my forehead oily, which was a nice surprise. No visible signs of smoothing the fine lines, but I don't have many yet either. I do think they need to do their homework and get with the times though. The ingredient lists three parabens, which preserve the product from spoilage and may disrupt our estrogen levels.

Olay 7 effects I tried this product and found it to be quite rich and made my skin extremely oily to the point I had break outs on my face and had to discontinue usage. I have oily skin already so it is not the product for me. But appreciated the opportunity to try before buying. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Not what I expected I had hopes for this new product to be hydrating as well as helping with anti-aging. I had to stop it after a week because it gave me breakouts and I never break out from anything besides period hormones. I waited a week for my skin to go back to normal and gave the cream another try, only to find out it would breaout my skin once again. I also feel that the cream is too floral for me.

Keeps skin moisturized and helps calm redness This a great moisturizer especially in the winter. Not only does it keep my skin hydrated but it seems to help with calming redness plus my makeup goes on so smooth after applying this first to the skin.

"Underwhelming Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is OK. But it's not great. It is a light, non-greasy formula that easily absorbs into my skin. But it leaves my skin still feeling a bit dry. The scent is too strong for my liking and I found the pump on the bottle to be temperamental. As yet I haven't noticed any difference to fine lines, but I'll keep going with it for a bit longer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Ingredient surprises I used to love Olay products, and when I got this Bzz invite I was so excited to try. Until I looked at the ingredients. Lots of alcohol which is drying, not moisturizing and the use of parabens. For shame Olay! It has a pleasant smell, but fragrance is an irritant so this isn't great for the face. It feels nice and is not at all greasy, it's just too bad the ingredients aren't better. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 I think the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 didn't live up to its claims for me. It was wonderful for a moisturizer, light, nice scent and non greasy. Only thing that is expensive for a moisturizer only. As for fighting the signs of aging....I used the entire sample and saw no change in my skuns appearance. If you have the opportunity give it a try, maybe you will have better luck. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effect I tried Olay product about fifteen years ago when I was a young adult. I never tried it back... And I won't... The fragrance is for me horrible. Easy to apply but I fee like my skin is left oily for few hour. So most of the time, I rip the moisturize off and put other product on. I didn't noticed any change on my skin. :( I won't buy Olay product for long time. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not Perfect, but a Decent Product Overall Firstly, as an individual with acne-prone skin, it is fundamental for any anti-aging products in my regimen to be non-comedogenic. After all, what's the use in eradicating unsightly wrinkles if one is plagued with equally unsightly pimples Unfortunately, there are severely comedogenic ingredients in this moisturizer (namely, isopropyl isostearate), which render the moisturiser unusable on the areas of my skin which are particularly acne-prone. As such, for the sake of reviewing this product, I was obliged to test the product in the area of my decolletage. For this reason, I would suggest that the moisturiser be reformulated, so as to replace the comedogenic ingredients and allow for the use of the moisturiser by those who unfortunately suffer from both aging and acne-prone skin. Aside from the foregoing, the moisturiser provides an ideal level of moisturisation, imparting sufficient moisture to the skin without leaving behind a greasy or oily film or leaving the skin in a somewhat uncomfortably dry state. I did notice, however, that the absorbency of the moisturiser is somewhat poor, as it has a tendency to sit atop the skin for an extended period of time, as opposed to being absorbed by the pores more efficiently, The scent of the moisturiser is acceptable, being neither overly fragranced or unpleasant. Overall, the moisturiser bears decent qualities, but, having regard to the negative qualities indicated above, is not ideal for my skin. Those who do not suffer from acne-prone skin, however, may likely enjoy a more positive experience from the use of the product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Here's Hoping! I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for just about a week now. I haven't really noticed many changes in my skin yet. I have found that it has been making my skin oily and my face has broken out. I am going I continue to use Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and hopefully will begin to see positive changes in my skin, such as skin tone. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
seems good but the idea of the olay total effects 7-1 seems great but i had a reaction so i couldnt continue using it for fear of developing a more severe reaction. I was really hoping that i woul d be able to use this product as i do not have a facial moisturizer This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"good as a moisturizer After using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 for more than 4 weeks, i found that it just offered me a good moisturizer, i did not see any other changes in my complexion. I would say if you are looking for a good moisturizer then this is a great find. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"It was pretty good This product was nice, but it didn't have anything that was really different compared to all of Olay's other products. I used it for a couple of weeks, and there was a small difference, but nothing new compared to all the products I've tried. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Product is too heavy for me. I think that this product is not for sensitive skin. I found it too heavy on my skin. It made me break out the first time I tried it so I waited a while and tried it again. The same thing happened, I broke out. Not sure if it is the product itself or something in it that irritates my skin. I gave it 2 stars since it didn't work for me but it may be good for someone else, which I cannot judge. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great find Now that I am getting older, I see the signs of aging. After I started using this product my skin took on a different appearance and made me look more alive. It goes on smooth and has an attractive smell. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"It's moisturizing but.... It's a good moisturizer in terms of doing the job. The first thing I did notice was the list of ingredients. The moisturizer I use on a regular basis is all natural, organic and Vegan which I love and contains 1 ingredient. This moisturizer contains so many ingredients that can't even be pronounced by a fluently english speaking person. So I am conscious of the fact that this is all chemicals. Not for me This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not for me I have been Looking for a moisturizer that could compete with some of the higher end (higher priced) options. There is little to no scent. The sample size was generous. It went on without any oily or greasy feeling and was light weight. I am sad to say that after using for 5 days, my skin was not very moisturizer and had started breaking out in weird places. For these reasons I had to discontinue use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effects 7 in one I think this product might be good for some, but it's not for me. I have sensitive skin and I really wanted to love because of the affordability of it, but I just can't use it. My skin itches too much when I use it and I ended up breaking out on my chin with pimples, which I never get. Not fun when you are trying to fight wrinkles and zits at the same time. But this is probably just my skin being all whacky. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not as great as I had hoped I like the size of the bottle, but not much else. Before this product, I was using a RoC anti-wrinkle cream, which I happen to like a lot more than this Olay one and I think it's a lot better quality, with better active ingredients. I don't like the texture and feel of this cream, it makes my skin feel greasy, and I already have oily skin. I'm hesitant to use it regularly as I don't want it to cause me to break out. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not So Good... It's moisturizing, but I couldn't get past the scent. I am somewhat sensitive to perfumes, but I am not so badly allergic or anything, but this was just too strong. It gave me a headache. I don't understand why any skincare line would put perfume in a product like this (that goes on your face). It's not necessary and what's worse is that I think that is what caused a breakout. I don't recommend this at all. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moistrizer Ok so I have been trying the sample of Olay Total Effects 7 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks now. The smell is a great light scent and it blends into my skin nice without leaving it feel greasy. I have not however noticed younger looking skin or anything of that nature. My sun age are the same and have not faded at all and my skin tone is the same. If using as just a moisturizer and not expecting anything else then this is ok. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Didn't work for me... I waited a while before reviewing because I was hoping to see some results. I really don't think it did much for my skin at all. My skin tone is still uneven, and I don't see any improvement to my fine lines. I do give it two stars because it wasn't greasy and didn't make my skin oily like a lot of anti-aging products I've tried, and it went on beautifully beneath my makeup, and didn't turn oily during the day. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Continue to testing it. Second day, I continue to test Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. First of all, my skin face burn after application. My skin is sensitive. If your skin is sensitive this product is not for you. My skin still burn after 9 hours after application. I have pink spot. This cream smell good. After 2 days it is too soon for anti-aging effect. Olay is oil-free, will not clog pores, fast absorbing, non-greasy formula. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects I first was very excited about getting this product. Then after some use of it ,I noticed I did not like the smell of the fragrance. But it did make my skin less tight and dry feeling. My skin felt a lot more smooth and I did notice my seemed a little more even toned. All in all I probably will not purchase this product in the future as I didn't notice that much of a dramatic change and that other products can do as well.

"I'd pass on buying In the recent years i've started to become interested in anti aging products and started using them daily. My daughter is interested in natural products and told me about all parabens. I usually get her to check for me and she said there were parabens in it, which there are. How can I feel good about using this regularly over time I used this twice. But I don't want to continue. I wouldn't buy it. It's just average. The smell was okay.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer First off, let me tell you a little about who I am. I am a mom of two and I am about to turn 40. I have some fine lines creeping up on me, some sleep lines that just do not seem to go away and a few lines around my forehead I would like to get rid of . So getting this with the promise of seeing results in 7 days was extremely appealing to me. I am fair skinned, blonde hair and blue eyes. Upon my first day, I used the cream as directed and I smoothed it over my face, the scent is light the cream did go on nice and smooth and the skin did feel good and have a healthy glow to it when I used it. I did not of course notice anything on the first day but of course that was ok. Now within 2 days of using this I broke out with 3 pimples on my chin and on my forehead and one painfully close to my lips so I do feel this product does have some type of oil in it so I would offer caution to someone who might be prone to oily skin. At this point, I still did not seem to notice anything changing at all. At the 5 day marker for use. I did not see any visible improvements , in fact to be completely honest I actually felt like things have gotten worse for me. My lines were not reduced at all and the ones around my eyes were actually more prominent and I had to use an extra cover up to make it look less noticeable. On the 7th day after completing what the advertisement claims. I was not impressed. My skin did not look better, it looked worse if anything and I noticed two more pimples coming in. At this point i decided to stop using it as it was simply not working out for me. It may work better for you, but in my case this did not help change my face or fine lines in any way.

"Olay Total Effects 7 - from a 37 year old! upon receipt of my Olay Total Effects 7 in one package, I must say at the onset I was juxtaposed by the trial size. Not because I'm greedy, but because I immediately wondered how much to use, what is the right amount how do I employ this properly to be able to successfully report on my degree of satisfaction (or not). That aside, I enjoyed opening up the package, and always find Olay products to be sleek and silky in their packaging nature. I put a dollop on my finger and began to apply (after cleansing my face properly, of course). The texture was ...silky and smooth. It was lovely. I saw the commercial on TV which reported healthier-looking skin in 4 weeks (I think - that is what I recall). With a tester, I'm not sure I can evaluate that claim - and apologies if I got it wrong, that is what I remember from the ad. I think the claim of 7 benefits is complicated for consumers. I can't tell you what those 7 benefits are and I'm reading the packaging of the product I received right now. I think to simplify for consumers is helpful and appreciated. Finally - no SPF. that's a big one for me. of all the benefits there is no SPF protection. The packaging doesn't specifically call out (that I can see or understand) that this product is to be used as a night routine. It also doesn't suggest that an SPF is required after application. With all the fears and media reports on skin cancer this is a big one for me. So all in all I maintain my overall favorability to Olay, but I'm not sure I'd go out and buy this product given my needs and likes. THank you for letting me try it, and I still do support Olay and will look for other products that might meet my needs. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects I think this cream isn't for me. After the first use I had a terrible reaction to it. My face turned red and became quite sore. I don't know if it was one of the ingredients or the fact that there is a strong scent to it. I prefer my face products to be scent free and at most lightly scented. However, Olay is a a very well known and trusted brand and while I'm sure my skin's reaction is rare, I think it would be wonderful for someone else. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"disappointed I was really excited to try this product. However, I was really disappointed. It doesn't moisturize my skin the way I was expecting. My skin is very dry in the winter and I was hopeful to try a different product that might help me. It's not the first time I use this brand and I think it's sometimes worth paying a little more for a better product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Pregnant, make me break out I've used different Olay products throughout the years and was excited to try Olay Total Effects. I'm 5 months pregnant and up until now, my skin has been its usual self, since starting Olay on Saturday my skin has had a lot of Acne. I have discontinued use for now but will attempt again once my skin clears up. I'm disappointed that my skin reacted this way and hope its hormones instead of Total Effects. I did like how the product went on, very smooth application. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not my favourite Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is OK. I like how my skin feels after I use it. But I don't like how strong the smell is. I haven't really noticed any anti-aging changes but it may be that longer use would show those. I find the packaging a little annoying - the cap is small and almost touches the nozzle, so it gets messy quickly. I don't expect I will be looking for this product in the store, but I'm happy to finish off the sample. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
I had a allergic reation I loved the opportunity to try the 7 in 1 total effects by oil of olay. After cleaning my skin and putting it on it felt like it was stinging me after application but then the feeling faded. I tried it for 4 days and by the 4th day my face started looking swollen and puffy so I stopped using the product as I was worried if I was allergic to it.

"Olay Total Effects 7 For myself, I did not enjoy this product. Week 1 my face was red and splochy. Week 2 started to look a little better not as spotty redness seamed to be gone. By the time I was done week 4, I found that my face was oily and greasy two things that I have never experienced before. I am willing to try a different product but this one was not for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Does not see the results the label claimed I like the texture of the cream, easy to absorb, but I prefer fragrance-free. The pump works extremely well, very easy to push and the amount of each pump size is very good, I am wondering if the pump is registered under the special pattern. Overall, I do not see any improvements of my skin, eg., educe the wrinkles. This products does not fit my needs. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Pretty basic I've been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about a week. (I'm not sure why they sent such a small sample as their claims say that skin can look younger in 4 weeks, but they certainly didn't send enough to assess that claim.) The seven benefits noted on the product packaging are: (1) visibly smooths fine lines and wrinkles, (2) evens skin tone appearance, (3) enhances brightness, (4) minimizes the look of pores, (5) visibly reduces age spots, (6) restores firmness, and (7) replenishes moisture. My fine lines are (thankfully) still at a minimum, but I didn't note any change. My skin tone is pretty even, with the exception of my rosacea, but I've been using products from Batty's Bath which have done lovely things for my skin so I don't think the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer have really contributed anything to that in a week's time. My skin did not appear any brighter to me. I didn't note any difference in the appearance of my pores. I don't have any age spots...yet. My skin didn't appear to be any more firm. And as for the final claim...replenishes moisture... I felt that the product was sub-par compared to my regular skin care and I had to supplement to ensure my skin felt hydrated. All in all, I wasn't impressed. The product has a pleasant scent and absorbed quickly, but it is highly unlikely I would repurchase. Thank you BzzAgent for sending me a free trial size version of the product, and allowing me to decide for myself. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Best product ever. I like to use on my skin. The product smells amazing need to use more often on my skin.
Love my Regenerist cream I am a HUGE fan of the Regenerist moisturizer. I don't leave my house without it. I have used olay products since I have been 18 years old. I am a loyal and faithful fan of Olay and my skin proves it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Three weeks later, I'm going back to my Olay Complete moisturizer I've been using Olay products since I was a teenager, and I haven't yet been able to find a product that I prefer more than the Olay Complete moisturizers line. I had high hopes when I received the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer sample, and started using it the day it arrived. The main feature I was excited about was the vitamin complex that's meant to help fight seven signs of aging, as I've noticed a few fine lines starting to creep in around my eyes. I'd also be happy to have brighter, younger-looking skin with smaller pores as Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 includes as benefits of the moisturizer, but the fine lines are my main concern! After using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 for three weeks, I have to say that I haven't noticed any difference in my skin tone, skin firmness, look of my pores, or fine lines (I don't have age spots, so that selling feature doesn't apply to me). And as much as I'd like to look 10 years younger in just a few weeks of usage, that wasn't my experience after using the Olay Total Effects sample. I also noticed that the product felt as though it sat on top of my skin, and when I got hot I had the sensation that I was sweating underneath the moisturizer. I've had this experience with other moisturizers, and that was the main reason I discontinued using all of them. I'm actively searching for an anti-aging moisturizer to add to my daily routine, and I hoped this sample would make me want to switch to the Olay Total Effects product line. However, Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 wasn't the right fit for me so I'll be remaining faithful to my tired-and-true Olay Complete moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
olay total Well i would like to start off by saying thank you to bzzagent for picking me for another campain. But as much as i was dying to try this product it i wasnt pleased with my results. I have to say it was easy to put on it has a light scent that goes away but after day 2 of wearing it. It cause my face to break out almost as if i was a teenager with acne and i never get pimples. But i do have senative skin so they may not help the matter so unforually of all i have to only give the product 2 stars. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay total Effects 7 I normally do not use Olay products, so I thought it would be a great idea to give this product a try. I'm also at that age where anti-aging products should be integrated into my face care regimen. Unfortunately this is not a moisturizer for someone with oily skin, which I have. I tried it once and it left me with very greasy skin, more so than usual. This then eventually led to breakouts. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I couldn't use it, too much perfume! I really wanted to like this cream, I had used it in the past but since switching to more natural and unscented brands, I am now not able to use anything with heavy perfumes added. This cream felt nice but it was like putting very strong perfume on my face and I couldn't deal with the scent. I prefer more natural products and I wanted to give this a try but it's not for me. I ended up giving it to my mom who's used Olay products forever. If you are sensitive to added fragrance or perfumes, this may not be for you. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I've used my Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about a week now. For me, it has just been ok. I have quite dry skin and I found that it doesn't hydrate my skin as my previous products did. I can't comment on the claim that it will provide noticeable anti-aging results after 4 weeks as I've only used it for a week. But, considering it makes my skin feel dry, I'm unsure if I'll make it to 4 weeks as I'll have to switch to something else. I hope they come out with a version for dry/very dry skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"sensitive skin I have sensitive skin,and can't use all creams. I have only used thus a couple times because the first time it felt like my skin was on fire and I had to wash it off. It didn't seem as bad the next day. I have a lot of freckles on my face and I feel like the cream brought them out more. might not be the cream for me but doesn't mean it wouldn't work for other. I'm going to try it again and see if it has the same effect. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"No visible results after one week of use The sample was large enough to use it each day for a week however either this is not long enough to see results or the product is not able to produce results. Anti-aging properties aside, I did not find the lotion to be any better than other moisturizing products on the market. The lotion itself was quite greasy feeling, took several minutes before it really absorbed into the skin. The product has a very light scent which is nice. Overall, I'm not very impressed with this product therefore will look forward to trying other similar ones on the market. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great as a moisturizer but thats about it..m I have been using Olay total effects 7 !!daily for over 3 weeks now and I am disappointed that I have not seen a change in my complexion at all. I was really hoping to achieve a more even skin tone and to lighten up a large sun spot on my cheek. I like this product as a moisturizer but I wouldn't pay the price for it because it doesn't do what it says. I have always liked Olay moisturizers and will continue to use them, Just not this one in particular! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Totally Effective mostly.. My biggest measuring stick for this is other people's comments . If they notice a difference and comment, then it must be working. Honestly I have had more people tell me I look ill or like I need to rest. (THANKS!) I will be going back to my regular good old faithful Nivea. I have been using the rest of the Olat totaly Effect of my hands and it's lovely. Hasn't done anything remarkable for my face though. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"7n1 oil of olay I think that this product is not a quality product for anti aging. And it does not live up to The claims it makes! After 5 days of use my skin feels very dry and i dont see any inprovements in my skin. The pore size is the same, the lines are the dame and even look worse now because of the dryness in my skin now, my skin tone has not even out and i have also gotten a few blemishes. i wouldnt recommend this to a friend. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Unnoticeable changes I have been using this product up and have yet to notice any difference in my skin. At first, my skin totally hated it because of the fragrance, but I kept using it to see if it would be beneficial at all. I broke out bad when I first started using this. After about a week I can say it is a nice lotion, but otherwise I feel it has too many ingredients. I wish we got the fragrance free version, or one with spf, as those both seem a bit more useful.

"Like a Leopard with Spots! So its been 2 weeks of application of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1. I have to be honest and say there hasnt been noticeable improvement to my skin. Could it be medication, hormones who knows, but i was hoping to see at least my pores get smaller or some of my freckles and age spots lighten up a bit. It feels great as a moisturizer after cleansing, but the dryness returns after an hour. Glad i had this opportunity to try it, hope it works for you!

"Irritating for my skin This product comes in an attractive container that doesn't require contaminating all of the product by scooping it out of a container to apply it, which I liked. The texture is nice and light, making it easy to apply. Unfortunately the product made my extra-sensitive skin break out a little bit - not unusual for skincare products. I usually need a natural acne-specific product and this confirmed my suspicions. For normal skin, though, I imagine it would do the trick for our dry, windy Canadian winters that make the face so dry. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"well, at least my skin is soft I have been trying the Olay Total effects 7 in 1 for about a month now, and have to be honest-other than my skin being moisturized well, I haven't really noticed any other difference in the appearance of my skin. To experiment, I have also been applying it to the back of just my right hand so I could compare the two....and to me, there is no visible difference there either. So, as a moisturizer, I think it does a good job-goes on easily,and only takes a little bit to do your whole face and neck. But in my experience, that is about it.

"Meh........ So let me preface this review by saying that I usually love Olay products. I've usually had really good results with them and so had very high hopes that the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer would be amazing. Sadly, it was just meh. Don't me wrong, it was a fairly good moisturizer but the benefits kind of ended there. I saw no change in fine lines or uneven skin tone. Perhaps the sample was just not amply sized to try it for long enough to notice the effects All in all, not bad, but not sure that I would spend the money on it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Okay moisturizer, not much else While testing the Olay Total Effects moisturizer for a recent Bzz Campaign, I was somewhat disappointed. Although the lotion did indeed moisturize my skin, it did little else. I did not notice any difference in any of the other benefits it was supposed to have. Did not smoothe fine lines and wrinkles, didn't even skin tone appearance, didn't enhance brightness, certainly didn't minimizes the look of pores or enhance firmness. It felt nice on the skin and gave some moisture, but I won't be running out to spend money on it for that alone. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer I've been using the Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer for a week now. I use it at night only because this does not have SPF contents. I've read that after applying anti-aging skincare it is very important to apply sunscreen on top, so instead of applying this plus sunscreen on top in the morning, I just use it at night. I believe this comes with an SPF version, which I would consider using in the morning. After a week of use so far, I have not noticed much anti-aging effects from it yet. Don't seem to see minimizing of wrinkles or fine lines, I have very deep laugh lines which I focus anti-aging products on, but I haven't seen any improvements yet. I like the container it comes in, which is a bottle with a nozzle so the product is not exposed to air as opposed to being in a jar. The disadvantage of that though is you cannot use the last bits of the product. The moisturizing aspect of this product is good, I apply it at night and when I wake up my skin does feel softer and not dry, more importantly it does not make my skin all oily when I wake up. Some night creams that I use will make my skin very oily the next morning, but this one did not, which I really liked, and it did not cause any outbreaks. I'll keep trying this and see if the anti-aging effect kicks in later on, but for now this just seems to be a good moisturizer, so whether or not I'll purchase this in the future is dependent on the price. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I wanted to like it... I have tried other Olay products in the past and they have been hit or miss. I like unscented products, so already this one was not for me. But I did try it for a few days anyway. I liked the texture and the thickness of it, not too heavy and not at all greasy, which is great before putting on makeup. I was disappointed that there was no SPF in it as that is a daily requirement for me. I did however breakout after two days of using, so I had to stop. I do have dry and sensitive skin so I have to be wary of what I put on my face, unfortunately this product I cannot use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Anti-Aging Moisturizer my mother always said when you have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all. maybe I have tried other creams and I'm comparing them to this one and maybe its not fair but when I tried it I could feel the dryness effect of the alcohol or soap that it carries. I tried to find out what ingredients it had but I could find out. in other words I was disappointed with the results it didn't leave my skin feeling nourished and it made my skin feel dry afterwards.

LOVE this stuff! It's the one I always go too! I love my down days when I wear no make up and I lather this on instead. It really seems to soften my skin and gives me a glow. It's the one I hope is never discontinued! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Did nothing good I think this is more suited for people with extremely dry skin. I have combination skin and this felt so heavy and greasy sitting on my face. It did not absorb at all, and I saw no noticeable results. It didn't make any improvement in my minor lines in my skin or help even out my skin tone. I don't have any age spots but if I did, they'd probably still be there. By the time I had used the whole bottle my skin looked horrible. So much more oily and made my cheeks break out horribly. I'm still fighting to get them under control. This is not something I will use again nor will I recommend it to anyone. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
I won't be using again I tried the Olay Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer and for the first few days I thought it was fantastic. Not much of a scent to it (which I very much appreciate) and went on smoothly. Unfortunately there must have been something in it that didn't agree with me. On the forth day I started getting a rash on my face (almost eczema- like). I didn't think it was the Olay because it had been fine for a few days. But I tried everything else I could think of before I stopped using it and within two days my skin had cleared. It's odd because I use Olay (regular) every day.

"not loving the thickness so far I'm a regular user of Olay products, so i really expected to love this. I'm approaching 40 and my skin is showing the signs of a life of working outdoors dark spots galore, deep wrinkles, fine lines, and of course uneven skin tones, from red to brown and everything in between. I normally use olay 2 in 1 day cream and serum, and it goes on light and absorbs easily. it also smells nice. by comparison, olay total effects 7 in one is thick, stinks like a gramma, and doesn't seem to absorb at all, it sits on my face feeling thick and greasy. i'm not in love after the first week.

"Okay Total Efects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer The scent is nice and mild. Worked great in clearing up my dry patches caused by the Alberta winter weather. After two uses I broke out in mild acne. I stopped using the product until my face cleared up then tried again......same result, acne! Because is could not use the product on a continuous time period I was not able to see the results that were expected. My results were that of acne. Will I purchase this product.... No. However, it may work for others with less sensitive skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Okay product Okay made my skin soft. The product was not greasy. It made my skin soft and I didn't feel it clogged my pores. My skin was not oily afterwards either. It dried evenly and nicely. It also smelled nice at first when it was in the bottle. Unfortunately, I had to discontinue use because half an hour after I would put the product on my skin, it would smell like rotten eggs. I guess it just didn't go with my skin type! Because of the smell I can't recommend the product to anyone else. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Pro's and Con's to this moisturizer I really wanted to like this moisturizer since I'm a faithful user of Olay, but after just 2 weeks of using the product my skin has become a landmine of pimples. I'm not sure if it's the scent or the colour but I won't be able to use this product in the future. I'll be going back to using my Olay moisturizer for sensitive skin. One plus about the product is that it does what is says in the Anti-Aging department. I must look younger since I'm 35 years old and was asked for ID the other day. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Light and only slighly sceneted I think the bottle and design are really nice and simple. The cream itself comes out easily in small amounts. The cream was light and not heavy at all when applying. If you are looking for something that is not heavily perfumed,light weight and easy application then this may be just the right thing for you!!! I reacted negatively and my skin became rashed and red but I do have sensitive skin so if you do have sensitive skin I would take precaution. otherwise a lovely design and nice light scent.

"On the fence I have just received my sample of Total Effects. So far I am on the fence. I enjoy the fragrance. The smell is very lightly fragrant which I don't like heavy smelling products so this is nice. You don't need to use a lot of this product. Less is more. It goes on easy, soaks in nicely but does feel greasy on my hands after. I have not noticed any changes with fine lines at all. Perhaps the goal is not to make me look younger but to ease the aging process from here on in. I will post back in a week. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Didn't notice a big difference I was quite eager to try the new Olay total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer - I will admit that I'm in my early 40's and worried about the start of wrinkles and other physical signs associated with aging. But when I tried the new cream, it didn't really live up to the high expectations I had. I found that my skin was very dry after 4 days of using the cream. so dry that the skin in my T zone was flaky and noticeably drier. I will admit that I have switched back to my regular moisturizer. I have not given up on this moisturizer completely, however. I plan to give it another try to see if I can see the anti-aging effects it promises. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer All in all after using Olay Total Effects for a month and a half I can't really say that I would jump and change my daily moisturizer. The creams claims to visibly smooth fine lines and wrinkles, but I don't have any to say that it is true. I don't believe I've used this cream long enough to know it's long term effects. I did not see any change in my skin firmness, brightness, and/or minimize the size of my pores. It is however a very nice and light and a refreshing cream and smells really good and moisturizes very well without a oily after feeling. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay is tje One for Me ALWAYS!!! I have been using Olay since I was 19 years old starting with the first product of moisturizer in a small bottle. I have not nor will I ever use anything on my face but OIL OF OLAY! HOORAY FOR OLAY! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer I am personally a fan of Olay Effects. I have tried it before but i broke out so I stopped it but when the campaign came, I thought maybe it's worth a try and the break out was just a one off. Unfortunately, it wasn't and I tried it once and broke out and thought I should intermittently try it to make sure and all 3 times, I had broken out. Everything else was good for me. The scent, the texture, the pump were all dandy except the most important part which is my face's reaction to it didn't bid well. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Disappointing Results Olay has been a leading name in skincare for decades. While I was eager to try this product to test its benefits, the very first interaction I had with it stunned me. Upon receiving the box, I read the ingredients. This moisturizer is based entirely with alcohol. Alcohol can provide a quick drying, non-greasy finish but it also zaps your skin's natural moisture, creating the need for you to use more of the product. I decided to try and put that out of my mind and try this product anyway. It is a pleasantly not too heavy lotion that I used every day for two weeks morning and night. Indeed, the lotion sinks into skin and quickly disappears. I did not experience any residual flaking indicating that my skin was not becoming more dry after use. However, in order to maintain the moisture level regular use gave me, I simply have to keep using the product. Other products I've used tend to help my skin maintain its own moisture and I can use the products as-needed. This product requires regular use again, this is a side effect of the alcohol. While this moisturizer gave me a lovely soft feeling after use and it was not unpleasant to use, I simply would prefer to have a product that would not perpetuate itself in my regimen. Perhaps if Olay is able to change their formula, I would be willing to try it again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good product but definitely not for me I wanted to try this product as I am starting to notice lines and wrinkles and a few age spots on my face. I liked several of the claims, skin looking 10 years younger in 4 weeks and visibly reducing age spots. I figured i would give it a try and see if it worked. After using the product for several weeks I didn't notice a difference in the lines or age spots on my face and my skin certainly didn't look 10 years younger. I found the product to feel oily on my skin and didn't overly like the feel. The one positive was that it wasn't overly scented. I will be going back to my Olay complete moisturizer as the Total Effects 7 in 1 just didn't live up to it's claims. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Feels oily and sticky every time I am getting used to the smell but not the stickiness Of it. I know you can find Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 fragrance-free and I think I would try that one. It might me great during the summer when my skin is different ! Also the fact that it exists with sunscreen SPF 15!!! Is great for me in the summer. Because I am outside al lot and I would rather have some protection rather then none. And that good creams are rare these days with sunscreen!! So I will definitely check the price next time to see if it's worth the investment !! Oh when it comes to pores it's worse really ! But as far as changes in age spots or Might be a bit better actually ! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Not for me I guess this just isn't the right kind of moisturizer for my skin type as I've had breakouts and blackheads showing up since I started using it. It doesn't feel heavy or greasy, it doesn't smell strongly, and I wanted to like it. Unfortunately I just can't. 2 stars for feeling good going on, any more than that would be lying because it's not working for me at all. I've had no wrinkle reduction, the bags under my eyes are just as bad as they were before, and my skin is greasy and gross a couple of hours after applying it. I'd give it one star but I don't think that's fair either as it's not a realistic gauge if it's not meant for my skin type. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"would not purchase I used this product for 2 weeks, and found no improvements in the look and feel of my skin. In fact, if anything, it made my skin feel,irretable almost itchy. Two days after I stopped using this cream the redness and irretablity stopped. So I am lead to believe it was the cream causing the redness. I also found the packaging to be an extreme wasteful . There was probably 10times more waste than product, not very enviromentally friendly. The feel of the cream was nice, it wasn't thick and greasy nor was it thin and watery. The smell was also very pleasant. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Not a good fit for my skin I have quite dry sensitive skin and I found that when I applied this moisturizer it stung and irritated the skin across my cheeks where I am especially dry. I didn't feel like it was very moisturizing and I really wanted to apply something else on top for the extra moisture. It was a bit uncomfortable but I was willing to give it a try for the night anyway. When I woke up my skin was very greasy and shiny. I felt like there was a coat of product that I wanted to wash off immediately. After washing my face was a bit dry but it actually looked fairly good. I didn't find this product comfortable for my skin and will not continue using it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay Total Effects Review I used this cream for about a week. I have super sensitive skin and am very cautious of the products that I use due to allergies. When this cream arrived I hoped that it would work for me. However, I was not one of the lucky ones and ended up with a bit of a rash after 5 or 6 days and had to discontinue using it. I did however pass the sample to my mom, who is in her late 60's and she loved the product! She said that it made her skin feel more soft but that she couldn't really notice the difference in fine lines or wrinkles. I did notice that she did have a more youthful appearance though. I'm keeping my eyes out for this product to hit the shelves to purchase for her as a gift :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not that impressive... I was not all that impressed with Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Firstly, I was put off by the smell. It is a faintly perfumed smell that I tend to associate with my 80-something year old grandmother. Secondly, it was not very moisturizing. I had to use at least double the amount of my regular moisturizer! Even then, my face still felt very dry almost instantly. I didn't notice any affect on the fine lines around my eyes and forehead. I did notice an improvement in my skin tone but that was about the only thing this product did for me. It is not something that I will buy in the future.

"No Positive Effect with Olay Well, I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and was really hoping it would be a product that I could add to my beauty regime. Unfortunately, the perfume in it is way too overpowering and causes irritation and a weird tingly sensation, so it was a bit of a let down. The texture of the moisturizer is nice and creamy, but doesn't live up to its claims, at least for my skin type. I have to stick with my usual brands that don't contain any fragrance. I think if Olay could put out a product that is geared towards sensitive/reactive skin, I would love that. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
The best This product is the best moisturizer i have ever used over the winter months. No tightness or flaky skin due to the cold. it is a godsend as i have tried many others that cannot hold a candle to it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Younger looking skin! I tried Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for almost 5 weeks. The sample size bottle is a great way for someone to try a new product without having to buy a full size bottle. It was the perfect size as it allowed me enough time and product in order to assess all of its claims. The cream is a very smooth almost silky texture and is easy to apply evenly. You need to know your skin though and avoid putting this on your oilyest areas. It was almost like it was too moisturizing for my skin! I started breaking out again like I was a teenager. I thought this would pass the longer I used the product but unfortunately it did not. As far as reducing fine lines and wrinkles, it helped a little around the mouth but my forehead lines remained quite pronounced. It did a very good job at reducing the appearance of dark spots though I have hyper pigmentation on my cheeks and this definitely helped reduce the appearance of the brown spots and help even out my skin tone. Overall, I think if you have very dry skin this product may help with moisturizing and keeping your skin tone even, but I would give it a pass on the anti wrinkle claim. I also wouldn't buy this product again because I do not want to relive the pimple face look of my teen years. I returned to using the Olay Regenerist line and my comexion has cleared up.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 I was excited to try this Olay total effects 7 as it arrived for my 3988th birthday. I brought it to work to share and tell... And my co-workers joked that they ordered it for me as a gift. I work with mostly women (8)... And I told them all I received it as a free trial sample. I love the dispenser.. But it can come out too much too fast if you aren't careful. It's very smooth and has a beautiful silky texture... Goes on nicely without perfume (which was really nice). I have not seen any results, but I have had a blemish appear for over a week under my right eye which isn't usual for me. I stopped using it from that point... I didn't find my fountain of youth unfortunately! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not enough time! I thought I would post a before and after picture but it seems like BzzAgent want me to put my review here now as I didn't finish the sample. So I'll not put this picture and just write my feelings about this cream...at least what I can tell for now. I really like the scent and the package. The pump is really effective and welll working. It was a great feeling to put this cream on my face every night but it is with most cream. For now I can't tell that I see much results, maybe a smoother skin but that's all. I don't think I will buy this cream because I had more results with my regular one. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Doesn't live up to the Hype I usually love Olay products but sadly, was not impressed by this one. I am not sure if the sample size provided long enough usage to really see results. I have combination oily skin with dry patches. I did not find this product to be very hydrating for my skin. I also could not get past the scent. I don't normally have issues with scent but this one was very irritating to me. I do like the Olay line of products but I am fairly certain that I would not purchase this or recommend this to my friends. I understand that we all have different skin and that what works on one person may not work on another, so I did mention to friends that I was trying the product. I wish I could write a glowing review, but I cannot. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not that much of a difference... The product did feel really silky and smooth when I put it on. I washed and had it on a clean face. I did however notice that over the two weeks, I had a few more blemishes especially on my chin and cheeks. My pores did look a bit small and not as noticeable but the pimples stood out. I had one that almost looked like a cold sore because of the size and location. I do occasionally get blemishes but this time it was worse. It may have minimized a few of my wrinkles but it was not that noticeable. I did not have anyone come up and mention anything about my skin looking any healthier. I will still try to keep using it to see if anything gets better as I did like the feel of my skin after. It was softer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Made me break out :( First of all, I have very sensitive skin so I tend to be very picky when it comes to moisturizers. I usually use products by Fresh or Josie Maran. Around the 2nd day of using this product, I got very bad cystic acne coming out from my temple. It was really terrible. Then my skin starts to get red patches. I stopped using this product at once. The product was supposed to be non-comedogenic but it did cause problems with my sensitive skin. I also found it to be really thick and not at all fast absorbing. I was hoping to like this product since it claimed to have so many qualities but I think I will avoid this product from now on. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects I really wanted this to be my product, but it's just not for me. I really like the initial texture. Went on very smooth and my skin felt very moisturized. A little too heavy of a fragrance for me, but it dissipated quite quickly. Unfortunately, it ended up being too heavy for me (even though I live in a very dry climate) I found my skin feeling greasy and looking shiny which I wasn't fond of. I do have quite a few darker spots on my skin, and really didn't notice any lightening - although the sample was small, so maybe it would have faded them more had I used the product longer I think that this product would be great for someone with EXTREMELY dry skin, or more aging skin (I am 42) It could be great, however it's just not great for me.

"7 day Olay Anti-aging 7 in 1 Moisturizer Trial After testing out the moisturizer for 7 days, I noticed little change from my before and after picture. Then again, I do not have visible wrinkles or fine lines yet. I am still in my early 30s. It didn't even my skin tone, restore firmness nor smooth out lines or wrinkles. However, it did brighten, moisturize and soften my skin as well as minimize my pores. As for the age spots, I don't have any. I found that it works well as a foundation or primer as I was able to apply makeup smoothly. In conclusion, I don't recommend this Olay product. It didn't seem to live up to its hype, however to be fair, my skin is still young so I think it'd probably show more results on a more aging skin. Personally, I would just buy the classic Olay moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Not for sensitive skin At first look I really enjoy the product. I love that type of bottle that lift up inside at each pump you lost less product that way. I also love the smell a lot and the texture too. But once I put it on my face just after my tonic the first time I did burn . .. a lot! I had to remove it and I waited about half an hour before trying it again. It wasn't confortable but after few minutes it was okay. I put it morning and evening everyday for five days because I comitted to try it but at morning 6 I wake up and my face was hyper sensitive and had many spots of eczema on it. I like many olay products but this one I Will not recomand it to anyone specialy if they have sensitive skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Total effects Olay Total effects is a pleasant facial lotion which packs alot of power as a all in one moistuurrizer. I really liked the scent and the feel of the moisturizer. It did not feel greasy. I used it for 2 weeks and I did notice a difference in my neck and face, it felt softer. On the third week, my skin started to react to the moisturizer, I developed a allergic reaction. My face developed small bumps and it became itchy so I had to discontinue using the product. After 3 days, my rash went away but it was still a bit itchy. I passed the lotion to my sister and she has used it with no problems. I am glad I had a chance to sample this product and to share it with others. I feel this moisturizer is not for me as I am allergic to this product.

Olay's hydration crete is skin's best friend. A very nice creme by Olay that provides deep hydration and soothes skin. Regular use makes your skin lovely and you can trust this product like all other Olay products. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Dissapointed..... I really wanted to like this product was hoping it worked, but after trying Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I have to say I am very disappointed. I saw no difference in my fine lines wrinkles, no difference in my skin tone, no difference in minimizing the look of my pores, no difference in age spots no difference in the firmness of my skin. If nothing else, I was hoping it would at least be a great moisturizer, but unfortunately, for me, it didn't do a very good job at moisturizing either. I have used much cheaper moisturizing products that have worked much better at hydrating my skin. So all in all this product was a huge disappointment for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects is Lacking This was my first time using a moisturizer as part of my daily makeup routine. I have to say I was disappointed in the results. The bad news: I only saw one out of seven effects work on my skin. I noticed an even skin tone and that effect worked consistently which is why it deserves the 2 stars. But I was disappointed that the other effects were non-existent. This moisturizer still was a good simple product if you're not looking for the extra features. It is easy to apply and didn't cause me any breakouts. It isn't scented which is a nice touch since the smell of makeup isn't always nice. Despite its good points, I still have to say I cannot recommend Olay Total Effects because it doesn't give visible anti-aging results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Disappointing As a 27 year old, I am beginning to see the signs of aging on my face. Fine lines around my eyes are probably what I notice most. I also have combination skin. So, when I saw I had the chance to try out Olay Total Effects, 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I jumped at it. After the first few days, my skin felt softer, and not as dry as it was before, which was exciting. I live in Saskatchewan, and the winter is cold and dry-- so I've struggled to keep my skim moisturized. However, a few days later, my face broke out in painful acne, which I haven't had in years. This could be a totally unrelated incident, but it was enough for me to stop using the cream, and I don't feel comfortable recommending it to friends either.

"A bit too much for my dry, sensitive skin At my age I am definitely in the target market for this moisturizer and was really excited to give it a try. Unfortunately it didn't work with my skin type. I found that it stung on my checks and especially dry and sensitive areas. It wasn't enough to make me wash it off but it was uncomfortable. As a moisturizer this was not intense enough for me. My skin felt dry and tight and like it had a heavy film on it that wouldn't sink in. My skin looked fine after a night of using it but I didn't notice any Immediate improvements in my skin tone. I won't be continuing to use this product but will pass it on to a friend. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good moisturizer, but not miraculous First, I have to say I am quite sceptical about anti-aging creams and quite doubtful of their real efficiency. To put the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer to test, I applied it only to the right side of my face for 4 weeks and used my regular face moisturizer on the left side. I then asked my husband, my mother and a friend which side of my face looked better... and they did not see any difference. To be honest, I could not see the difference neither. So no miracle here, the 7 in 1 cream was not anti-aging. Still, it was a good moisturizer. I really liked the smooth texture and how it leaves my skin soft. Not sure it's worth the extra money for the anti-aging tough. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Unfortunately did not work with sensitive skin When I first saw the benefits of the Olay regenerist cream, I was quite excited to try it. I found the texture to be thick, but went on smooth. The texture was a little tacky after applying. I used the product morning and night after cleansing. I was not able to properly assess the benefits of the product because my skin began reacting poorly. I started to get rashes, swollen, redness and dry patches after one week of use. After that I have discontinued use. It should be noted that I am generally allergic to sunscreen ingredients, but there was no SPF listed on the cream, so I thought it would be safe. I really had hoped this would work on me, but unfortunately it wasn't a good fit. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 When I received my sample I was a little surprised at such a small trial size. I decided to just use it around my under-eye area so I could get a better idea of the results without running out of the product too soon. I was immediately turned off by the heavily perfumed scent it had. Why put fragrance in a facial product when it's a known irritant Thankfully, the smell dissipated fairly quickly and applied nicely. Didn't feel too greasy or heavy and my primer went over it just fine, as did my foundation. I didn't have any pilling of products and no creasing of makeup. On the other hand, I didn't notice any brightening or anything else it claimed. It was a pretty decent moisturizer and that's about it. If the fragrance was removed, I may consider buying this but mostly I'll stick to what I already use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not quite sure about this one.... I was really excited about trying this product...and it was perfect timing because I had just run out of my usual go-to, that I was coincidentally, also getting tired of. I am 35 now, so I am definitely on the look out for a good anti-aging moisturizer. My first impressions were that I liked the packaging, and the pump seemed like a good option. For me though, the moisturizer itself was too thick. I like more of the gel style because it glides on more easily. It seems when it's thicker you tend to use more. And it had a fragrance,while I prefer fragrance free, as a person with skin sensitivities. I stuck with it for a few days though and I did really like its moisturizing abilities. My dry skin diminished. Not sure if it improved my lines or uneven skin tone. TBA as I continue with its use! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
I love it I love iteveryone should try this it's great I love this product it makes you look younger it took away all my wrinkles everybody is amazed about how I look and I looked to be about 15 years younger
Not the one for me When I got my sample of Total Effects from Olay I was really excited because Olay products are great. I'm not showing much signs of aging yet but it's never too early to try to take care of your skin. My skin is dry so I'm always trying to find something that will help keep my skin looking and feeling great. Sadly I don't think Total Effects is the product for me. Not only did I have a breakout after using the product for a few days but my skin felt tight and sort of leathery. I had to stop using it after two weeks. This hasn't sullied me on the Olay brand. Perhaps my skin was just too sensitive. So I would suggest if you have sensitive skin to get a smaller bottle to make sure you don't have the same experience as I did.

"Sumptuous skin! Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream leaves my skin sumptuously soft! It moisturizes, diminishes wrinkles, softens, and leaves my face radiant and fresh! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"No real change I use such quality skincare products now that I actually found my skin didnt look quite as good as it normally does. I find that after applying this lotion my face felt really waxy, or like it had a layer of plastic on it. I really disliked the smell of the lotion as well. As soon as I apply the lotion I immediately have to wash my hands. Now my skin did feel very soft after using it, but I haven not noticed any improvement in my skin at all. I gave the 2 rating just for the softness, but overall this seems to be like most anti aging product on the market all hype and no results. Now that being said I really dont have any wrinkles but the overall feel of my skin is no where near the same when I use my Seacret products. I'm thankful that I was able to try this product. Being a bzzagent member has its benefits to see if certain products actually work. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"this product did not deliver I started using Olay TotalEffects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer 3 days ago and noticed quickly that it was not doing wonder on my face. I have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin with rosacea. I am in my 30's. I mixed this product with my foundation thinking that it would blend well. Unfortunately, after a couple of days, I noticed more breakouts on my face and was very disappointed. I also did not like the fragrance in this product. Because my skin is so sensitive, I am very careful not to use scented product on my face. I also noticed my face being more red (at the end of the day after removing my make up). I did not notice any benefit from the couple of days that I used it. I wished this product was doing wonder for me but it did not. Maybe you will have better results I am sure it is worth to try, especially if you do not have any acne and if your skin is not too sensitive. The size is cute and the product, because it is 7 in 1, covers many steps that usually, we would need many more products to do the job. For busy moms and-or busy working women, this product is definitely a must-have for the morning routine, since it can replace many of the products we use everyday.

"Going back to my Olay complete moisturizer I've been using Olay products for over 10 years. I love the Olay complete moisturizer and I have never been able to find a moisturizer that I prefer more. I had hoped the Total Effects 7 in 1 anti aging sample would be similar if not better however that is not the case. I was excited about the anti aging claim with the vitamin complex as I am not a teenager anymore. I'm sure every woman wants to have younger looking skin. I have used the product for a few weeks now and I haven't noticed a difference in the fine lines, skin firmness, the size of my pores or age spots. The claim of looking 10 years younger in only 4 weeks was just not going to happen. I did find my skin to feel greasier so I won't be using the product anymore. I will continue using my Olay Complete moisturizer instead. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"First Impressions I was pretty excited to be given the chance to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer as I have fond memories of a beloved Aunt using Oil of Olay (flashback!) in her beauty routine. Sadly, so far I am not that impressed with it. For me, as I have sensitive skin I have to be careful what I use. Unfortunately, when I applied this moisturizer to my skin after my shower (as I always do with my usual moisturizer) I immediately noticed not only the smell (pleasant but I prefer unscented) but the fact that it was hurting my skin a little. I experienced a slight burning pain. It didn't last long and I think it might be due to my dry sensitive skin but it is something for others with similar skin to be made aware of. I skipped a day of using it and now I will try it next before makeup application instead to see how that goes. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not as good as I hoped I was cautious about using Olay Total Effects as I have had reactions to Olay products in the past. After a couple of uses I was pleased that it seemed to be fine. OK, now it was time for the true testing. I had previously been using expensive syrums and creams that worked great but were costly so if this worked it would be fabulous. It was a nice lotion, not too heavy or too fragranced (although I didn't care for the scent but it disappeared quickly). Sadly, I won't be using this product on a regular basis. It kept my skin from drying out but as far as anything else it almost went backwards. My pores and fine lines seemed to show up more and it did nothing to even skin tone. I guess my skin was reacting to it just not as strongly as it normally would with dry skin and irritation. It may be a nice lotion for those that can use it, unfortunately it is not for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not meant for me I really wanted to like this product as I have used Olay products in the past but this just wasn't for me. I have really sensitive skin and tend to be cautious about putting new products on my face as I have had terrible allergic reactions in the past. While I did not get an allergic reaction to this particular product it did however make me break out. I don't have any fine lines or wrinkles so I cannot comment on how it performed there. I have continued to use this for a couple of weeks not to try and get through that purging stage but I don't see any improvements to my skin. My skin actually feels quite oily with this moisturizer on and I already have oily skin to begin with. It does however keep my skin hydrated, if anything I would suggest for the oily girls out there to use this as an overnight regimen instead. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Really wanted to like this product i really wanted to like this product. I was so excited when I got the invite. Was a bit surprised by how small the bottle was. I thought I was supposed to try this every day for 4 weeks. Thought maybe it just went really far so I gave it a go. First thing I noticed was how strong the scent was. Re-reading the info on this website it says you can find in both fragrance free and with sunscreen. The actual sample I had wasn't actually fragance free. Now it probably wouldn't bother anyone else but I'm a bit sensitive. Luckily it didn't trigger a migraine for me. After 2nd day my skin felt a bit tight and itchy. FIgured it was just working. Woke up 3rd day with blotches Wasnt' sure what was causing this so I stopped everything - shampoo, laundry soap, etc. Took 3 days for blotchiness to go away. Tried again 2 days later. This time reaction was stronger... within 24 hours rash and burning. Worst thing about this (and unfortunately it's happened before) is there's nothing you can do. You can wash and wash but sometimes that makes it even worse. Luckily I still had almost 1/2 bottle left so I was able to give it to a friend. More about that in my bzz report.

"Not for me! I definitely think I'm too young to really see any actual difference after using this product. I've been applying it almost daily for the past two weeks, and I've seen no real difference in my skin tone or texture. The pores on my nose are a tad bit smaller, but I wouldn't credit that to this moisturizer alone - I think just getting into the habit of washing my face every morning so I could apply it had more of an effect then the actual product. It also has a slight tint to it that didn't match my skin tone at all, which I didn't notice until I was out in the sunlight. I'm very pale, and the moisturizer has an almost yellow tone to it. It definitely looked off, and I made sure to apply to my face AND neck to insure even coverage. Seeing as I'm only 25, I'm aware that I'm not the target audience for this particular product. I'm thankful I was given the opportunity to try it out, but I won't be purchasing any for the future! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not your grandmother's oil of olay When i think of Olay, I think of the pink cream and the smell I automatically associate to my grandmother and her friends. it goes without saying that i was sceptical when I signed up for this project but i was pleasantly surprised. This product is goes on easy, does not have a greasy or heavy feel and there is a very pleasant smell to it. Most importantly, it left my skin feeling refreshed and soft, this being said. I did not notice any changes with the promised results of this product ( smaller pores, finer lines, enhance brightness,...) and after a few days, I did find that my skin was getting dry and starting to flake on my nose and forehead. So to sum this up. My biggest concern was the smell and I did not need to worry about this, this product is great to apply and goes on comfortably and easy. However, I would have to give it a failing grade based on the fact that I dont believe it holds up to it's 7 anti-aging claim, and because it seemed to dry out my skin, not only did I not appear younger but my skin did not look healty.

"Still waiting for results to show... I have been using Olay Total Effects 7-1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer now for a couple weeks and so far I haven't seen much difference to my skin tone, age spots. What I do like about it so far is that it keeps my face moisturized and absorbs really quickly and doesn't leave your skin shiny. I actually love the size of the trial product because it is small and you will use it up in less time which means all the active ingredients would not have been exposed to the air for as long as it would take to use up a full size bottle. The dispenser helps with oxidization and contamination since it is a pump unit but still there likely is a time sensitivity for the active ingredients in it. What is really disappointing and not surprising is that I see no difference to the large pores around my nose, my number 1 beef about my skin. I really don't think anything can actually make your pores shrink but I keep trying. Since it's only about 2 weeks it may be that results start to show as I continue to use it. I'll keep you posted... This review was collected as part of a promotion."
I am a believer I use this product on my face as well as an area on my thigh that I had a skin graft on. Love it love it love it. My skin is so soft and as a result I am aging well. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"No Difference I use Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer every morning and besides keeping my skin moisturized I don't really see any other difference. I am 29 and look like I'm 18 ( I still get ID'd at the liquor store) so I don't have any fine lines or age spots. I do find that I have a slight uneven skin tone but haven't seen a major difference since I started using the lotion. I do have very dry skin so I have noticed that my face looks brighter and more hydrated but I feel like I can get the same results from other products. The cream has a nice light scent, not over powering at all, I thought the lotion seemed a little thick but it absorbs rather quickly and I put my make over top of it. My skin is definitely softer, but I think there is something cheaper on the market that can get me the same results as I find this to be rather expensive if I'm just using it as a daily moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Better for dry skin wonderfully, did not have to work it into my skin too much since it absorbed easily. The moisturizing hydrating aspect is wonderful. However, I have oily-combination acne prone skin. Before using this product my acne was under control with extremely low surfacing. I used the product for a week every night, I noticed new acne bumps on my skin. Additionally, my skin became oily throughout the day forcing me to blot a few times. I did not notice the other benefits because the resurfacing of my acne caused a big concern. I do not recommend the product if you have oily or acne prone skin. However, if you have dry skin, it may bring you better results than just moisture alone as Olay advertises. The product should advertise best skin types the product is suited for, knowing before you buy is better than realizing the product is not for you. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Too Rich for My Oily Skin I am in my mid 40's and have very oily skin. I was only able to use this product for a couple of days before my face looked like it was back in high school (i.e., full of pimples). If you have combination/oily skin, I would suggest trying a sample or the trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer first to make sure it doesn't cause you to break out. I was hoping for a starter anti-aging product to act as prevention for fine lines and firm up my pores a little. For me, I found that the moisturizer was not absorbed by my skin and it seemed to just sit on top of the skin layer, clogging my pores. It does have a pleasant scent and I really wanted to like it, but it's just too rich and moisturizing for my skin to even test it further to see if the rave anti-aging effects are applicable. I was able to test this product for free from BzzAgent for review. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good cream, just not for my face. I was so excited to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 face cream, which is supposed to be ultra moisturizing while providing 7 other anti aging properties. I normally have really oily skin, but lately, especially with it being winter in Canada, my face has been very dry. The first time I tried it, I put it on at night, before bed, and woke up with the softest skin I'd had in a while. I was so happy! So I put it on the next night after my shower, and woke up and my skin was so greasy and oilly i felt like i had dumped my face in a tub of oil! I washed my face and put the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 cream back on and left the house. By that evening, I had broken out into a million zits and blemishes. The next night I used my usual skin cream, and the zits were all gone. Im sure this is a good cream, but for my skin tone, its too moisturizing, or just not right for my skin. I really wish that I would have known how full or moisture this cream was or how it reacts with oily skin, before I got it the cream and broke out after 3 days of using it. Currently I'm not using it, but I think I'm going to try it again, maybe only using it every other day. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not for me I'm so sad. I had such high expectations for this product.. I love Olay and use many Olay products. However, this particular product.. Olay Total Effects 7 In One did not meet expectations. Lets start with the good! Very light weight and non greasy!! Nice scent too! Unfortunately, it also left my face red and patchy. I used it faithfully every day for an entire week, hoping that it would get better and less abrasive on my skin, but it did not. It didn't even my skin tone in the least, instead it became blotchy. It also therefore didn't enhance brightness. I had to then use a BB creme over it to even and brighten my skin, and found that it just created a paste with the OLAY Total Effects 7, even though I waited half hour one day, before applying. I also didn't notice any change in fine lines or wrinkles. Overall, I believe this product failed to live up to the claims. I wonder if it would have changed my mind a bit if it was tinted, and left and even colour/glow This won't stop my from buying Olay products, but I would not purchase this one.

"Better for dry skin I was very excited to try the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. My first impressions were good based the level of moisture, texture subtle but pleasant scent. The application was wonderful, did not have to work it into my skin too much since it absorbed easily. The moisturizing hydrating aspect is wonderful.

"Recommended for Oily Skin I Think Not! I have been a HUGE fan of Olay's pink hydrating lotion since...well, forever. Recently, however, I've noticed the small beginnings of a smile line at the corner of my mouth. I came to this site and was referred to Total Effects Daily Moisturizer through the Olay For You guided tutorial. I was skeptical because I entered that I had oily skin, and that seemed like it would be too heavy. Nonetheless, I trusted them and gave it a shot. Unfortunately, they were wrong. A few days into the change, my skin started breaking out, and the pores appeared larger. I know that skin can break out just because its routine is being shaken up, so I intended to wait 2 weeks to be sure. I made it to day 8 before finally pulling the plug. I had 4 pimples instead of my usual 0-1, and my skin just looked greasier and not as good. And that smile line is still there! I will be going back to my Pink Stuff! And to tell the truth, at about 20 a bottle, I'm kind of glad that the Total Effects didn't work! I would much rather be a slave to a 9 jar than a 20 one!"
"At Least It Smells Nice Well, I've given Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer a very good go. Everyday so far (except today). What are the good points and the bad points PROS: Smells nice, feels luxurious on the skin when first applied, good consistency, not greasy. NEGATIVES: It leaves a white film on your skin if you happen to rub your face a minute after you've placed it on. This is true even on newly scrubbed skin that has no dead skin left on it so it isn't dead skin. Also, I think this actually made my fine lines stick out MORE. Before I tried this product, I hardly had any fine lines. I had great skin. I used to use my regular moisturizer and was very happy with it, this cream seemed to accentuate the fine lines around my eyes. I've not used the product in the last 2 days and voila! my skin looks great again, no fine lines around my eyes. This is all hype without much substance unfortunately. Would never recommend!

"Moisture yes...anit aging..not so much So let me start by saying this is a very good moisturizer. My skin was left feeling soft and hydrated. I have very dry skin so this was good. That's about all the good I have to say about it. The scent of this cream was way to overpowing for me. I am a bit sensitive to scents and this was just too much for me, I was feeling sick and it lingered for a lone time. Also my skin is sensitive and I think because of the amount of perfume in this it make me itchy and red and so I had to stop using it after a few usues. I did pass in on to my mom, who has more mature skin then me and she loves it. She feels like it does smooth some of her fine lines and leaves her skin feeling soft and smooth. so I guess it just depends on your skin. If you are sensitive like me then I would stay away from this, but if not and you want a good moisturizer that does have some anti aging properties then this product will be good for you.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 nice, but not for Sensitive Skin I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 has some pretty high claims so I was pretty excited to try the sample size cream. I did notice upon opening the cream that there was a slight scent to the cream. The texture is very light and it doesn't feel greasy on the skin. It does make the skin feel smoother and it does seem to hold moisture in the skin. After a couple of uses the skin around my eyes started to get itchy. And after two more uses it got worse, so I knew right away it was the cream. I kept on using the cream and avoided getting close to my eyes at all, which I find such a pain. I didn't notice any difference in my fine lines or sun spots. The only thing I liked was the way it made my skin feel. I have now had to stop using the cream because any residual cream that I may have had on my fingers would irritate the skin around my eyes if I was rubbing them at all. I really wish this cream were scent free and hypoallergenic. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love it! I, like many other mature women, am trying to fight the aging process. This product really helps, everyone says I look 10 years younger than my real age. Thanks Olay! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Anti Aging Could it be Well I was given a sample of the Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer to try in exchange for my honest review. Well, I just celebrated that certain birthday that some would say would make me over the hill. Do I have fine lines yes, but earned every one of them so when some product claims to fight fine lines and other things, I'll give it a try. Firstly, it's in a really cute and easy to handle package. It's supposed to be a 4 week sample amount but I doubt it. My skin is dry so it soaks it right up. Which brings up one really great aspect of the product....its doesn't burn my skin like other non hypoallergenic moisturizers do. I have been using the product for almost 3 weeks now and other than a great moisturizer, I have to say its not anti aging anything. Would i recommend this product I guess that is ultimately going to depend on what the price will be when I head to the drug store . Its a great moisturizer but nothing else.

"Okay, Olay. I enjoyed trying out the new anti-aging moisturizer from Olay but unfortunately I didn't see all the effects this 7-in-1 promised. I have been using it daily for 4 weeks every morning before I apply makeup, and sometimes at night before bed. It comes in an easy pump container and applied very smoothly and absorbed quickly into the skin. It left a matte finish and had no oily characteristics at all. It has a very faint moisturizer scent, but is less noticeable than other Olay products I've tried (I like scented products). Of the seven benefits listed the one I did find it succeeded in was the moisturization. It's a very good facial moisturizer and does so without being greasy or oily throughout the day. I was happy to be able to apply it under makeup without problems. It prevented dryness and flaky skin that I can get a lot in the winter. When it comes to the evens skin toneclaim, it was successful in just providing an oil-less matte finish. But this is just to say it looks like my natural skin and that there's no product on it. It didn't even out my complexion though. Now sadly the other 5 signs of aging continued with me. I saw no difference in my fine lines, wrinkles, and crow's feet. And I was surprised that it didn't enhance brightness. I've used a lot of Olay products that did have beautiful microscopic shimmers/illuminations in the moisturizers and this one had none. It didn't brighten at all. My pores were also the same large size I can see them without a magnifying mirror. I don't feel it made my face any firmer either. I have the same amount of elasticity and softness as before. I was really looking forward to seeing a difference in my age spots. I do use an ineffective age spot treatment nightly dabbed onto these spots and have used this for a year with not lightening. My point is that every night I use a magnifying mirror to examine them and after 4 weeks of using this Olay Total Effects product they are all still accounted for and the same size and darkness. I really wish they would go away. So overall I have no difference in appearance to my face and its flaws and therefore do not look visibly younger. It is a nice facial moisturizer suitable for both morning and evening application, but that is as far as I can recommend it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects - Non Effective I received my Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Eventhough I am often mistaken for looking much younger than I really am, I have noticed some progressive signs of aging on my face in the last couple of years. As such, I was was very excited to try this moisturizer out. I have been looking for an alternative moisturizer to combat some fine lines that have begun to form on my face - largely on my forehead between my eyebrows as well as below my eyes around my upper cheek area. The other reason I was excited to try this moisturizer was to combat some of my other problem areas: I have uneven skin tone that appears dull without makeup and I have large pores that are difficult to mask even with foundation. I also have very oily skin but combined with dry patches when I don't properly moisturize. The Olay Total Effects packaging was very nice looking and I was able to open the packaging easily. Due to my sensitive skin and allergies to certain chemicals found in many beauty and makeup products, I instantly scrutinized the list of ingredients. Fortunately none of the ingredients listed matched the small list of chemicals I am known to be allergic to. My next step was to pump some of the product onto my hand to do a a patch test on my wrist. The pump easily dispensed a small dollop of product and I found it quite easy to control the amount that was dispensed. Next I proceeded to do a smell test as I generally do not prefer any strong perfumes or smells to be applied to my skin. I found that the smell was gentle and not overpowering at all - just a hint of floral-like scent that didn't linger whatsover. Next I applied some of the moisturizer to the inside of my wrist. The moisturizer glided on smoothly and absorbed into my skin without leaving any residue or oily feeling. This was a huge plus for me. I repeated this patch test over the course of a week to ensure no hives or rashes. Finally I felt confident enough to apply the product to my face. This was done nightly right after cleansing my face. The moisturizer seemed to absorb easily into my skin and generally didn't leave an oily appearance. It also seemed to moisturize the skin. However this is pretty much where the PROS of this product stops. After repeatedly applying the moisturizer to my face every night, I did not notice any change in my skin. In fact, I noticed dry flakey patches the next morning where I had applied the moisturizer. This was very disappointing to see - especially since my regular moisturizer never left flakey patches. Another great disappointment is that the moisturizer did nothing to smooth out my fine lines and forehead wrinkles. There was absolutely no improvement. My pores were still largely visible and my skin tone no brighter. All in all, I had high hopes for Olay Total Effects but the moisturizer did not seem to have any effect on my skin. Perhaps the formulation and/or the ingredients is not what my skin needs. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Let's see if this really works! I just received the lastest BzzAgent campaign for Olay Total Effects and am excited although skeptical to try this product. Being in my 40's now, and recently becoming a grandma, I'm starting to try to recapture my youth. Let's face it I'd rather not look my age. I'm beginning to notice some fine lines around my eyes, the evidence of age-spots and blotchy looking skin. Over the years I've tried numerous products that claim they address similar issues and to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. When I opened my BzzAgent campaign, my first impression was wow, that bottle sure is cute but very, very tiny. If I've learned anything from being a BzzAgent is that unless you try it don't always go on first impressions. So being the objective person I am, I'm going to include Olay Total Effects into my daily regime. Yesterday was day 1, after showering I performed my usual facial cleansing, exfoliating followed by Olay Total Effects. It took but a moment to realize that the reason that the bottle is so tiny is because you really don't need as much product as you'd think. It completely saturated into my skin, leaving it feeling velvety (If that's a word) and not greasy as most products tend to leave my skin. I have not yet noticed a visual difference, but am impressed with the feel of my skin and a very light scent. I've found that the products I've tried can tend to smell like medicine, but this is very subtle. I feel confident that if I use this product daily within a week I should notice some differences, so I'll be checking back in with updates. I'm really hoping that this product does what it claims, to have people say wow, I can't believe your a grandma, look at your skin, would be the ultimate compliment.

"Its ok I love the cleansers but this cream is a little too thick for me...I have trouble going to bed with it on...a bit greasy and has a lot of fragrance. I just purchased the micro sculping cream and I can't wait to try it tonight! One point though, this cream has lasted a very long time, though I don't use it every night becuase it's not my favorite."

Not something I will purchase I found this cream to have a nice texture when putting it on. But it doesn't seem to moisturize as much as I'd like it to. I also found that it caused me to break out a little bit. I wouldn't purchase this in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Mostly moisturized. This moisturizer went on smooth without leaving my fingers feeling oily, but I found the scent a little strong for me.

Not impressed. I have been using this item for the past couple weeks. I am not happy with the item and won't be continuing use. I don't see a difference and I don't like the feel of it on my skin. I have used other products that have worked better in comparison. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Not for me I have not had success with this product, this is not for me This product has made my skin break out and has not helped with my dryness! I have no doubt that this product would work wonders on other skin types, however I will not be trying this product again! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Not for Me I think this product would be great for a person who does not have sensitive skin. I found it a little too scented for my liking. I also found that it clogged my pores. Perhaps this is best used as part of a night time regime rather than during the day with makeup. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This product smell amazing Because it smells good because it faces cream and it work good on your feet
"Not for me This product had some good qualities and unfortunatley, some bad. I found this to be just too heavy for my combo/oily skin. It actually made my skins texture bumpy and I did not continue to use it. I love other Olay products but this one was just not for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Feeling regenerated This is a wonderful produce, particularly for those of us who need regeneration. It applies smoothly and does not feel caked on. My skin's appearance has improved. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not for my skin I am finding that this product is not working well for my skin type! I have been using my trial size however my skin has broken out in white heads! I have several girlfriends who swear by this product, however in my opinion this is not the product for me! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

product did not live up to marketing claims although it smells nice and was an ok moisturizer the product did nothing along the lines of anti aging or improving upon the way my skin has already aged over the years. i even tried to simply use it on one half of my face for comparison purposes and there were still no discernable results after 7 days This review was collected as part of a promotion.
not really enough included to actually see a difference I just started using it but I'm not really noticing a difference maybe because the kit didn't have enough to make a proper review or maybe I'm just not noticing This review was collected as part of a promotion.
isn't working with my dry skin It's an overall ok face cream. But at the moment I have extremely dry skin and this cream just isn't working for me. It is leaving my nose and for head with dry patches so I will have to switch back to my old stuff... I didn't see any change in my skins appearance but then agaiN I did not give it the 4 weeks it has asked for. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"MRS Tammy W I was thrilled to receive the sample of Olay Total Effects 7. Generous sample size too. I found the product too heavily fragranced. However as a moisturizer, it went on like a cream and absorbed like a lotion which I loved! I did not find it to be superior to my current moisturizer though, so I have no immediate plans to purchase it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
7 in 1 I'm game!! I have been using my new Olay total effects 7-in -1 moisturizer for a week now. It defiantly has evened out my skin tone quite noticeably! I can't wait to see the long term anti aging results!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Not for me I have used Olay moisturizers before, but I tend to stick to the simple variety: unscented, for sensitive skin. The scent of this moisturizer immediately put me off. But I tried it anyway. It was light and non greasy, but I didn't see much change in the appearance of my skin. For the price I wouldnt recommend it.

"regenerist I started using the regenerist line of Oil of Olay and my skins looks and feels great, Getting compliments that I dont look my age, Just love the whole line of Olay This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Soft, but oily.... The first day I used Oil Total Effects, I was very impressed by how soft my face felt. I enjoyed the smell of the product as well! Unfortunately Oil Total Effects was too oily for my skin and after a week of using it I had quite a few break outs. If I didn't have sensitive skin, it would be the perfect product for my daily facial routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Ms Wendy Preteau I tried the product and liked the light, smooth texture to the cream. It has a pleasant smell as well, and felt relaxing Unfortunately, my skin is very dry and it drank up the small sample within a week! In that time, I enjoyed the moist feeling in my face and I would definitely recommend it to people looking to try a new product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good Everyday Face Cream I think that Olay Total Effects is a good everyday face cream. it didn't combat my winter skin dryness, nor did I see any significant reduction in wrinkles or skin firmness. If I used everyday religiously, it did seem to lighten a few sun spots I have on my face, but these seemed to reappear if I forgot to use it for a few days.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturize Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-aging Moisturizer I was excited to receive this sample because theres nothing I love more than trying new skin creams and am always looking for the *Hail Mary* product at a lower price point than skin care I currently use. Upon first application, my skin felt hydrated and plump, maintaining that feeling for hours. Unfortunately, during those few hours, I developed a rash and the next day a cystic pimple emerged on my chin. My skin can tolerate a lot without ever experiencing a rash but I do have issues with spots of acne following test drives with new products. This just happens to be one of those offenders. I always give products a second and even third chance in case a reaction is simply coincidence so a week later, I gave it another go with same results. Third time was also a bust. Because I couldnt use the product daily, I cant comment on most of the issues this product claims to address. I dont know specifically which ingredients make my skin break out. I do know that typically, any breakout I experience is usually related to products containing parabens or sunscreen. I understand that many products on the market require parabens to stabilize the product. Aside from the suspect paraben related outbreaks, I am also a breast cancer survivor and sensibility dictates that I cannot dismiss the potential association that is often made with relation to paraben content in our day to day skin care products and health issues. When theres more than one paraben involved, its a bigger concern. Stars added for the nourishing feel of the cream, subtracted for paraben content and puzzling rash.

"glowing skin This product gave me glowing skin, helped my skin feel comfortable and hydrated, and also was a good base for makeup surprisingly! I wish the sample was just a little bit bigger since it says that you see results in 4 weeks, and I finished it in about 2. Also, I don't really like the scent of the product very much but it does dissipate. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Moisturizer I think the product is a good moisturizer. My skin tends to dry out pretty quickly but this one keeps it moisturized. As for the anti-aging effects, so far I haven't noticed a big difference in my fine lines and uneven skin tone. I haven't used it for that long so hopefully I will start seeing the effects it claims to bring about. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects I liked that this product did not leave my skin too oily and had a pleasant scent. Unfortunately the sample size was too small to give a fair review of this product. I had enough moisturizer for 10 days use. Although I thought it was a good product, I did not notice any visible change in my skin in the limited time I used it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Just alright it was nice on my skin the first few days and it felt uneasy the next days so i stopped using it. probably not the kind of product my skin wants, i thought i found the right product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice scent. I did like the scent of this product, it wasn't over bearing which is a nice change from other similar products. However, having said that, I didn't find that it actually did anything. My face did feel somewhat smoother but that is about it. It did nothing for my uneven skin tone and I found no difference in the fine lines on my face. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"a little to long to see results From some of the other commercials I've seen there are products out there that show results much quicker than 4 weeks, I've been trying the Olay Total Effects 7in1 anti aging Moisturizer for a little less than 4 weeks but have not noticed a single line being smoothed away... not that I have a lot just a few laugh lines. But so far they are still there This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Olay Total Effects okay I have now been using this moisturizer for 4 weeks. The consistency is good. No noticeable smell. Goes on feeling non greasy and absorbs well. While it is doing a good job with keeping my face moisturized I have not seen any of the extra benefits that it claims. Fine lines and uneven tone have not shown any improvement. So, no visible results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
So far so good I'm only beginning to use Olay total effects so no visible results just yet but my skin is being well moisturized I had flaky skin before and now I don't so that's a good sign that more results will come. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay Total effects I did like the cream, but I have VERY dry skin and felt like it didn't keep my skin feeling smooth all day, you could see my dry skin after just a couple of hours and the more cream I put on the heavier it felt on my face. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay review This Olay product smelled nice and provided moisture to my face. However I didn't not have any other visible results on my face. I would buy this product for the moisture benefits and maybe the other results would show after longer term use. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Not for us..... Last week i tried Olay Total Effects 7-in- 1 , unfortunately I am allergic to the product , I given the product to a friend to do a test...... Unfortunately she had skin reaction to the result use Olay Total Effects product 7-in- 1 . this is the first time we had a skin reaction after testing a moisturizer. Too bad the product looked promising ... Better luck next time ! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"sadly a reaction I did love the quick work at reducing fine lines and such. But sadly I had a mild reaction..surprised me. My skin is not prone to reactions, I did pass product on to my sister andshe loves it..went out and bought a bottle to keep using. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"good as a moisturizer I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about 3 weeks now. I put it on every morning, it is nice and light, does not feel greasy at all. However I do not see any change in my skin tone or aapreance. I will keep using it to see if over the next couple of weeks i see any other changes. But for now it is a great moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice feeling It absorbed beautifully but I didn't find it really helped at all for the issues it's supposed to address. It's really nice to only have to use a very small amount to cover my whole face and my skin felt better and was definitely better hydrated but it didn't do enough for me to justify the expense. Not much in the way of smell, which is fabulous. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I was leery but excited to try I have tried the Olay Total Effects twice so far and I am pleasantly surprised. I haven't used very many Olay products and I didn't feel overly positive about the brand. So far I really enjoy the cream. It has a lovely soft texture and nice smell. My skin felt soft and it absorbed quickly. I haven't noticed any changes in my skin yet, but I am pleased so far This review was collected as part of a promotion."
my sister loves this! my sister has been using this product for years!
"Skin feels smooth. While I did not find that this really helped with any noticeable difference in the lines and look of my skin, I did find it my skin felt smoother while using this product. It has a pleasant scent and felt nice on my skin. It wasn't sticky like other products and didn't have an overbearing smell. Nice product but didn't live up to the claims it makes. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Don't see much difference.. Don't get me wrong I do like the cream, its light and non greasy. This is the end of 2nd week and I don't see a difference... I been applying it twice a day, before/after bed...maybe I'll see more changes in a few more weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Initial first couple of days When first putting on cream, it feels silky and smooth on the skin. I put it on after taking a shower where my skin is the driest. Olay total effects did moisturize my skin. I felt however throughout the day that the cream stayed of top off my skin leaving a slight glossy feel that I do not like. Will continue for 4 weeks to see if the cream reduces my fine lines. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay nice product Love the size of the container for travel! Pump works great, size is perfect for carry on. Really like the weight of this product, goes on even and does not leave a heavy feeling on my skin. Results, well those are still unknown at this time. I can say that I have not experienced any break outs, which is a bonus. Skin is soft and blemish feel. Now for those wrinkles. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So far so goid Been using the cream for nearly 2 weeks now. Although the I don't notice any difference with my wrinkles my skin is significantly softer. I had absolutely no problems allergy wise, I love that such a small amount goes so far This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"It Really Works I did like how much moisture it added to my skin, smaller pores but unfortunately I had a reaction to something in this product. So I have given to a friend to try and she had tight looking skin, smaller pores and a healthy grow! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Anti-aging I really loved the olay effects! Infact I love the olay brand itself! However I did not notice much change. I was a bit let down by the product but that may have just been my experience. I still think it's worth to try. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"pretty good! I think the trial size is perfect size for me to use and try. I will use this when I travel because it's so convenient. I broke out the first time I used it but it was around my time of the month so I can't blame it on this item. Otherwise, my skin looks great. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
you have to try Olay Total Effects 7in 1 I think that this product moisturized my skin a bit to well.Since starting to use it 7 days ago .I have a face full of acne.The brown spot on my cheek is lighter in color now.And my very fine lines are a little less noticeable.I dont feel that it has changed my over all skin tone.Let my daughter try it and it gave her an acne breakout also .But her face feels smoother on her forehead and cheeks.

"Disappointed user I really liked this product for the first week or so and then it didn't seemed to keep it's promises. It was great as a moisturizer, but I did not find that it made any difference with the appearance of my skin. Maybe I don't have enough need for the changes that it promises, but I found little or no change. It might work better for someone that has more issues with their skin.

Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream I love it! I use this product twice a day and after 1 week could see an improvement in my skin. I've even given it as a gift to a friend so she could love it also. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Light and Not Greasy Olay goes on smooth and easy. It was light and not greasy or heavy. It seemed to keep my skin moisturized for most of the day - even with the cold dry winter. I didn't notice any real difference from my other moisturizers as far as wrinkles or skin tone - it seemed to make the fine wrinkles less noticeable (especially around the eyes), but of course the wrinkles are still there. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Prefect size for travel I was pleasantly surprised by the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. In this time of year my skin is super dry. My skin eats up the moisture, but it doesn't make me look oily or breakout. The trial size is great. I always find skin products super hard to find in travel sizes and this one is a perfect fit for my travel cosmetic bag. My one wish is that there was SPF. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great scent After trying Okay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer, I have not noticed any reduction in signs of aging. What I can comment on is how great the product feels when I apply it onto my face. The moisturizer feels light and and makes my skin feel smooth. There is a bit of a fragrance but it is not strong at all. I did not have to use very much of the product to moisturize my face. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Fairly standard I have been applying this lotion regularly for the past 2 weeks in the morning after cleansing my face. This moisturizer is good. It absorbs well into my skin and you do not need to use a lot. However, I would rate this product as average. I have not seen any noticeable difference in my skin since using it. Disclosure: I received a free sample as part of a campaign from BzzAgent This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Skin Plumper The product goes on super smooth. Works amazing as a primer under makeup. The only thing I found was that if I used it, it plumps up the fine lines and wrinkles. Make your face look really even, smooth and well texturized. However, this is a product that will be needed to use continuously if you want it to be effective. Great primer, not Greasy, and very effective against wrinkles. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Moisturizing, but not a fan of the scent. I haven't gotten a chance to use it for a full four weeks to see how much my skin has changed, but so far it seems to be a lot more moisturized. It does have a scent, which I am not totally in love with. It does smell nice, but I get headaches because of some scents. My skin also broke out for the first week while using this, but it could be just my skin getting used to a new product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Made me break out :( I have heard such great things about olay total effects however it made me break out! The product does have a great smell. I did pass it along to my Mom who said she thought it helped with the crepiness around her eyes. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Not much difference I really don't notice much difference than other products, but perhaps if used longer it may be more noticeable. The size received doesn't really give enough time to try the product to see how well it can work. I do like that it goes on quickly, and don't have to wait for it to dry before proceeding with other products/makeup. The scent is nice and mellow. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Average product Received this for my 30th birthday as my first piece of the Total Effects line. Once I got used to the pump product was easy to dispense. A little goes a long way. Has a pleasant smell. I use acne products as well and they dry my skin. Due to this I need a little more moisture than this product can provide. This product did not improve the overall texture of my skin.
Smells great when you first open it I saw changes within a month and I use it every other night with a warm cloth
"LOVE this product! I've used the Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream for years. It hydrates my sensitive skin without clogging pores and has the most wonderful, fresh scent This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good Moisturizer...Not Sure of All the Supposed Benefits Yet I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a couple of weeks now. First impression is that I like the texture (not a watery cream, also not a heavy cream, somewhere in the middle). But it does have a strong scent and not one I like unfortunately. My skin does feel moisturized but I will continue to use it and see if the other supposed benefits are happening. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"All in all pretty good So it's all gone, every last drop. I don't if it last a full 4 weeks or went beyond but I used it all. And honestly I am sad that it is gone. I have used Olay products since I started to use a moisturizer on my face many moons ago. I have never tried the expensive ones, like the anti-aging lines or the fancy ones but I have always wanted to. So I was super excited to get a trail version of the Olay 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer. I didn't notice any changes in my fines lines (there aren't that many so maybe I can't really comment on that). My skin tone however seems to be much more even and I did notice that my pores seem much smaller (I have MASSIVE pores). It didn't really smell like anything which I liked and didn't like at the same time. Sometimes the unscented smell really bad! This one was ok. the light smell went away as soon as the product absorbed into my skin. I have very oily skin normally but once the winter hits it can get super dry! (crazy I know) This moisturizer actually did a really good job of keeping my face moisturized and I had no dry spots show up (and we had a week of -15 and blowing cold wind while I was using the product.) I would love to say that I will run out the minute that this product hits the shelf and buy it so that it can become a part of my daily routine but I will have to see how much it retails for before I decide. I do however love Olay products and will continue using the one I am using and the minute it hits the shelf I guarantee you I will be checking it out again and seeing if the price point is where I can afford it. All in all a good product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 - Just OK After using this product for a couple weeks, I am not sure I would purchase it. I found it just ok. It did moisturize well, unfortunately it also did seem to trigger an acne outbreak. For the price, I would like pass on purchasing in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"GOTITFREE Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Thank you for sending me a free sample to try.However, I found that the sample I received was not big enough to show any improvements. The scent was very nice and I found it dried very quickly and did seem to make my face feel silkier.But there was no difference in my age spots, my skin did not feel firmer and the fine wrinkles are the same. I would probably not purchase this item again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 day review I tried the olay total effects moisturizer for 7 days and here are my results. Visibly smooths fine lines and wrinkles, I didn't not find a big reduction in the appearance of fine lines, although being only 40, I do not have many noticeable fine lines or wrinkles. Evens skin tone appearance, this was not something that was measureable for me as I have a skin condition called vitiligo where my skin gets white patches. Enhances brightness, I did find my skin looked softer, I am not sure that that is the same as brightness but I did notice a difference in the appearance of my skin. Minimizes the look of pores, I didn't find this minimized my pores, I actually found the opposite effect, and did have a few spot that broke out while using this cream. I did discontinue it's use because of this. I may try it again in the future to see if it was an isolated event that was not related. Visibly reduces age spots, no age spots here to test it on. Restores firmness I did not notice any visible changes in the firmness in my skin. My problem spot is under my eyes but I didn't not apply this that close to my under eye as there is a seperate product for this. Replenishes moisture, I did find my skin soft, with little to no dry spots after a couples days of use. my kids because quite soft after the full 7 day trial. It worked well under my makeup and didn't cause any noticeable sticky spots that dry skin tends to do with makeup. Over all this product is a nice moisturizer but does it live up to all of it's claims, I don't think it does. But there are no miracle fixes for aging, so if you take this as Olay advertises relating to growing old gracefully this is a nice addition to your beauty regimen. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
I haven't noticed a difference yet I should have taken a before picture before I started using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer because I honestly haven't noticed a difference in my fine lines or skin tone. I did notice however that my skin was dry (could be the increase in winter-like weather) so I have had to supplement with my usual facial moisturizer. I do like the texture and mild fragrance of this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Maybe...Olay I was not overly impressed with this product. Yes, it smells nice. Yes, it smooths on nicely. Yes, it absorbs quickly. Did I notice any improvements in my skin.....no. The sample was too small. A product like this normally needs to be used religiously for at least a month before any improvements are seen. I appreciate the sample. It has interested me enough to buy a full size bottle to give it a real try. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Subtler than a Facelift I've been using Olay Total Effects anti-aging moisturizer for several weeks now, and I've noticed a subtle improvement in my fine lines. My laugh lines and the lines between my eyebrows are less noticeable, my skin feels softer and smoother. The moisturizer is creamy with a strong scent so I only use it at night, but it seems to be working! And it is certainly cheaper and safer than a facelift! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I feel smoother I liked the Olay total effects 7 in one anti-aging moisturizer. It was very smooth. I am about to turn 40 and I feel much older. After only a few days I feel smoother, tighter a little younger. I will buy this product. It didn't have an over bearing smell, and wasn't greasy. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Brightening I noticed a brighter complexion after only a couple of days of using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I noticed a few of my fine lines seemed less visible. On the downside, though, I found it irritated some of my skin and left it a bit red and itchy. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Thick and creamy I love how thick and luxurious it feels and yet it applies easily and penetrates nicely. My face looks and feels softer therefore my makeup goes on smoother too. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Notice the Difference I think this product is amazing, in just a short while you start to notice your skin looking younger and even feeling younger. I have noticed the fine lines are disappearing., and my skin tone is really evening out. you'll want to go out and purchase this product once it hits the shelves. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about a week now. The texture is nice and light. It'd be a good summer time moisturizer, but I'm not sure if it is good enough for me for the winter time. I usually use something that feels richer in the winter. I haven't seen any difference on my fine lines and dark spots yet. Hopefully, it will come with time. So far, I quite like the product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Total Effects 7 since my last review 2 weeks ago I still have noticed much of a difference in my skin I did not have many fine lines and no wrinkles at all. Only thing I have noticed is my face has more shine to it. I have told my Mom about it and gave her what I have left so we will see how it works on her.

"Not sure if it worked I love Oil of Olay products but I'm on the fence on this one. I like that it was light and not to heavy, it didn't clog my skin and the most important part was that it was not heavily scented. But not enough to tell if the effects on my skin. I would try it again though. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"An all around cream I like the non- greasy texture and consistency of Olay Total effects. It's non- irritant and good for sensitive skin. I like the fact that it comes in a pump for sanitary reasons. This also helps in controlling the amount used, avoiding excess usage of cream. It's light with a slight tint, adding some colour to the skin. The size of the sample, did not give me adequate time to see an extensive change in my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"First Review on Olay Total Effects I've been waiting a while to write this review to give this product a try. It feels nice on my skin. I have sensitive skin and my acne has gotten worse ever since I tried this product. If it weren't for that, I would continue using it and consider buying it. My skin did however feel soft and hydrated after I used the Olay Total Effects. I have also mentioned this product to my mother who is thinking about trying it.

Not wowed by product I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 ant aging moisturizer is great as a moisturizer not entirely impressed on the anti aging aspect of the lotion .I don't think any product can truly help wrinkles but I gave it a go and didn't notice any true signs of a change in appearance but my skin felt very soft and the moisture lasted in my skin.The scent wasn't bad and overall I will give it a average as moisturizers are concerned. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"OLAY TOTAL EFFECTS The very first time I tried this product, I felt a my skin got little softer and brighter but as days passed I started noticing that my skin started to get itchy. At that time I had to stop the further usage of Olay Total Effects . I guess this product is not made for my oily skin type. I can recommend this product for the people who have dry skin as one of friend tried it on and it suited her really well. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Silky smooth I have always really liked Olay products and this one is exceptional as well. I love how little you need to cover your entire face and neck. It has a great scent and goes on silky smooth. It has been a really dry winter and I noticed that this lotion really helped lock in moisture all day long. I do not have many wrinkles so couldn't tell if it did anything for them, but then again that's why I'm using it, too prevent aging. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Not a product for me I felt this product was more for people with mature skin. I felt like I had a minor rash when I used it the first time. My skin took a few times to get use to it. But now the question is was it worth my time. Unfortunately it wasn't worth it because I didn't see the effect on my skin as of promised. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
smooth finish! I love how this moisturizer makes my skin feel so smooth! I apply it before my primer and it helps my skin look flawless! Seem less oily throughout the day. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Need to use longer Smells fresh clean. I have acne prone skin so I am concerned about products that feel oily/greasy. I didn't break out any more than usual I'm able to wear my regular makeup without issue. I didn't really notice any change in my pores but it does moisturize well. My face did feel firmer. I don't have wrinkles so I can't speak to that. Over all, I'd have to buy full size and use for longer to determine if the 7 effects are true. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Helps even out skin tone Since using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I've noticed my skin tone has evened out. I have also noticed that my fine lines have started to disappear and the vitamin complex has helped make my skin look smoother. The only downside to it is that I've noticed a few more breakouts.

"Pleased thus far The product goes on very smoothly and absorbs into the skin quickly. It works well with my day serum (always a concern) and has a pleasant fragrance. So far since using the product I haven't noticed any differences in my skin, but am hopeful the advertised results will soon show themselves.

"Smooth and soft This cream is very nice, it goes on well and does not leave your face smelling of perfume. I really liked applying it. Unfortunately, my skin is dry and it didn't hydrate enough. It was however very soft and did not irritate or cause redness. I would suggest it to friends and family who do not have dry skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I was excited to try Olay's new Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer as I use a lot of other Olay products. From the first use I was impressed! It didn't have an overpowering smell, the cream was light, absorbed easily and didn't have a greasy after feel. I would definitely add this to my product line!

"Pretty good moisturizer It works well. It soaks up fast, non greasy and keeps my skin hydrated. I don't know if it's necessarily better then the facial moisturizer I already use, but I think the anti aging properties is a definite plus. Instead of using an anti aging serum under my moisturizer I just put this right on. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects I've been using Olay Total Effects daily for about four weeks now. Overall I would give it an above average rating, but I'm not a convert. While it is moisturizing for the most part, I find it gives my face an overly shiny appearance while leaving my cheek areas still dry and flaky. As such I find I am constantly needing to blot the excess oil, and applying other moisturizing cream on my cheeks. So the search continues... This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Pretty good face cream This Oil of Olay cream was the first face cream I had tried that was actually enough moisture for my face and left it feeling soft. While it did a great job of moisturizing, I'm not sure how much of a difference it made with my aging needs. I didn't notice any reduction in wrinkles, lines, etc. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Unfortunately I'm allergic I used this for about a week, but unfortunately I ended up with hives/bumps. I am allergic to so many things - I have no idea what could be in the product that caused me to break out. I'm sure it's a great product for those who aren't allergic to EVERYTHING, but for me, it just didn't work out. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Reliable Olay Olay has been around for many years. I loved the product had to be careful as I have rosacea, it has a wonderful feeling on the skin, no film or sticky feeling. It had that mild scent that olay is known for. I like the pump bottle. It didn't seem to harm my skin, however i didn't used every day This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This product is AMAZING I LOVE this product, Works great. Leaves skin feeling moisturized, hydrated, soft, silky. smooth and AMAZING!! I would definately recommend to everyone, this product is so worth the money, great value. Miracle worker and I LOVE IT!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Divided about this one... Gives a good hydration (but haven't noticed any other benefits), skins feels great but I have had acne problems many times since I started using this product so I am now reluctant to using it since I am afraid that it is the cause of my acne outburst (I hadn't had that problem in a long time).

"Goodbye Wrinkles So very excited, I just received my sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer. I can't yet rate it, just started it tonight. I am using it as a night cream because I have Rosacea and have to use a Rosacea cream during the day to relieve my skin problem. I put the cream on and I like how it feels on my skin. It absorbed quickly and its not greasy. Took a picture of my left eye, cant wait to see the wrinkles disappear! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
I cant use it I tryed it out to see if i could use the product but its scent made me have an asthma attack so instead i let someone i see everyday use it so i could judge by their face. They said they like how it makes their face feel and they are noticing that their skin feels and looks nicer then it did before. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Final Review Well after giving this product one more shot to help with moisturizing in cold weather I have concluded the following: 1. It did seem to add a younger glow (+) 2. It helped Moisturize (+) 3. It was lite weight and my face didn't feel weigh down (+) 4. It caused me to break out in my face (-) This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay Total 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisture I was so excited to receive my sample in the mail. I started using the first night it arrived. I loved the feel of it and it really seem to moisturize my oh so dry skin after a couple of night. The third night was the end for me.........woke up with swollen eyes and blotchy skin. Allergies kicked in with no mercy. Not sure what ingredient was the culprit, so disappointed. Hopefully will be able to find something that I can use.

Nice product but not forl all skin I have used Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few days only but I had to stop because even it I loved the texture it made my skin dryer. It has all the features I wanted especially minimizes the look of pores and Visibly reduces age spots. This product is nice but it's not for all kind of skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"I'm not sure I look younger... While the moisturizer feels good and smells nice (not overpowering), I'm not sure that it makes me look visibly younger. Also, I wish it had an SPF, because now I feel like I need to use two products. (I believe that there is a version with SPF, but I don't have it.)I've posted before and afters...see for yourself!

"Can't compete with my regular moisturizer... I like this product because of the nice sheen it leaves, however I have dry skin, especially in the winter and need something with weight. Olay Total Effects would maybe be ok for me in the warm months, but in the winter I use a night cream as my day cream because I need that extra protection and moisture. For those of you that do not have overly dry skin, I could see this working for you. Give it a try and see how it works for you! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer this is my first bzz kit.. so i got to try the trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer.. i found that it went on nice, and the first night night made my skin moist ans soft. i found it had a light sent. but sadly by the third night i had to stop using it as i started to brake out in a rash. so i assumed i'm allergic to something in it.. i think i would recommend it to someone that does not have sensitive skin..

"basic but good It's not something FANTASTIC and AMAZING but it smells good, decrease the appearance of pores, lives a soft skin but will not be moisturizing enough for winter for sure. Could be good for spring and eventually summer but not enough for fall and/or winter. I've tried it for 2 weeks now and it gives my skin a lightly healthy glow that I appreciate. In conclusion I'm probably going to keep it apart for the winter and use it again in spring This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Feels moisturized without greasy feeling I like the product but dislike the dispenser. With the hole in the top it is strange to dispense and leaves a mess on the top of the container. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Regenerating This Generation One day I looked in the mirror, and wondered when I started looking old. I had to do something! I started to use Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream at age 65, and my dry old skin is now softer and smoother than it's been in years. Yay!"
"Olay Total Effects I'm torn on this product. For me specifically there are pros and cons. The pros: A little goes a long way There's no oily feel Absorbs nicely Little scent Skin feels smoother (for the most part) The cons (well there's just one really): On my T zone, there have been many more break outs than what I am used to I like the product for the most part. Around the eyes and my cheeks it feels great. Not so much one the forehead and nose though This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"nice product but... I love Olay products and use them 99 of the time. I like the texture and smell (yes it is perfumed so if you are sensitive to smell be aware). It soaks in quickly and it feels great, however, as the day progressed I felt my skin was become tight. I am not sure if it is because of the winter weather, but I feel like my face is lacking in moisture by the end of the day. It would be interesting to be able to compare it to spring/summer months. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
great moisturizer not sure about the rest I have been applying the new Olay total effect 7 in 1 for the last 4 weeks. Overall i like the creamy texture and the smell is pleasant and not strong. It leaves my skin hydrated especially in the dry winter months where my skin gets dry. I noticed my skin a lille bit more firm As far as reducing wrinkles and pores i didnt really noticed a difference. I would say its a great moisturizer overall if youre not looking for targeted areas This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Good product The product is good because you can see the result really fast and moisturizer the skin. The result depend a lot of your kind of skin but you can see some good result. I like the oil-free because it does not stick or look gross and the fast-absorbing so result can be seen fast. The packaging is good designed and easy to use This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Nice but where's the sunscreen I like the texture and consistency of the product. It smells nice but is not overpowering. It penetrates my skin quickly and leaves no greasy film. I haven't been using it long enough to gauge whether my skin looks more youthful BUT I know that sun damage is a major cause of aging. So why doesn't the product contain sunscreen This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Not much difference I was excited to try this product but was a little disappointed in it. I have not seen or felt any changes to my skin. I usually use coconut oil and I find it did a better job than this cream. I had high expectations as I have used other Olay products in the past and liked them. It did not leave my face feeling greasy though, it does go on very nice and is very light feeling. I was hoping it would have faded some of my lines and faint spots. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 I like the smell and how it feels when it goes on. But as far as seeing lines go away and helping with brown spots, have not seen a difference. I have had this I believe for a week."
"Day 7 using Olay Total Effects 7in1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I've been using Olay Total Effects 7in1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for 7 days and nights now. It is non-greasy, absorbs fairly quickly and kept my skin moisturized for about 6 hours before my skin needed a moisture reapplication. Big thumbs up for the very hygienic pump nozzle. You can control how much product you dispense. The fragrance is a bit strong. I prefer non-scented skincare products. Overall a good moisturizer. Not as brightening as an AHA product.

The smell really turns me off I've been using the free trial size I got for free from BzzAgent last week ... And well while I love the consistency I really hate the heavy scent that's in it . The perfume in this cream make my eyes burn a few days after I started to use it so I'll be discontinuing it . I think this cream has potential but Ther perfume in it has to go . This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Good moisturiser The trial sized version of Olay Total Effects is good for use in an overnight bag, or tossed in your purse for spot treatments. Its small size may not be the best for a full on sample of its benefits, but it does offer good moisture, if anything. This would be good for someone with mature skin who is looking for a light, dewey look. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Wonderfully hydrating I have been using this cream for almost 1 year. I love putting it on my face because as I massage it into my skin I can feel the cream absorbing into my skin. My skin is soft yet supple and it looks great without spending a fortune! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Not the best for me Olay is not a new brand, infact it has been around for many many years. My Great-Gran swore by Oil of Olay moisturizer. When this popped up on my BzzAgent list, I knew I had to give it a try. Now, I wouldn't say I'm old enough to have this moisturizer targeted towards my age group - but it never hurts to prevent or start a regime that will help my skin in the future. You're never too young to start. First off, I was a little surprised at how small this size was, and such bold claims it made! Younger looking skin in less than four weeks! How! This product claims to visibly smooth fine lines and wrinkles, even skin tone, enhance brightness, minimize the look of pores, visibly reduce age spots, restore firmness and replenish moisture. Smooth on clean face and neck, for best results use daily. This has your typical Olay scent. I'm not really a fan of scented facial products just because I have sensitive skin and I never know what is going to burn when I use it, or make my skin more dry. One pump is more than enough to cover your full face. It just soaks into your skin immediately and provides an instant rush of hydration. It dries somewhat matte. I didn't have a chance to try makeup on top of it, but I have a feeling it wouldn't work for me. I think this moisturizer would be good for someone with normal to lightly oily skin. I don't find that it is hydrating enough for my dry skin, because after about half an hour, my skin feels like it needs more moisture. I prefer a thicker cream, especially now that it is winter. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Sample size just wasn't enough I like the fact that it did not dry out my face or make it greasy but the sample size just wasn't enough to get the full affect of the product. I personally only got a few days out of the bottle. It's hard to recommend it since I didn't see any changes. I would definitely recommend the Olay brand though, I've always been a fan of the company This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer This product is light weight, non-greasy, and very moisturizing. I have not used it long enough, in my opinion, to determine if I gained positive results from all the 7 benefits promised by this product. I would however recommend and buy this products based on how moisturizing light weight and non-greasy it is. I really like this moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"7n1 moisterizer oil of olay claims 7 in 1 anti aging beneifits. Ive been using for 4 days and I have noticed a very little difference in the fine lines under my eyes but Ive also noticed some negative things. For one the moisterizer is sented and the perfume in a moosterizer can be very drying, i dont feel like my skin is well moisterized when using this face cream. Also there is no sunscreen in it which is important to prevent aging. I will continue to use and update later. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Brighter Skin I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 for a couple of weeks now. I love that my skin tone appears more even and I've had less breakouts since I've been using it. It's a light cream, not too thick and absorbs quickly. There isn't a strong fragrance which is good for a face cream. The cream has a slight tint to it which makes your complexion glow. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't seem heavy enough for my dry skin now that winter is here. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Initial Thoughts... I have combination skin, so it's hard for me to pick an appropriate moisturizer. I used the product for two days, and broke out on my chin. I am waiting for that to clear up to start again. I plan on trying to use the product on my problem areas (in between eybrows, forehead and laugh lines), instead of on my entire face. So far, 3 out of 5. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer Recently tried Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, and found it left skin soft and smooth. It has a pleasant fragrance( Can be bought fragrance free), but found it bothered my contact lenses even when being careful applying around the eye area. It absorbs fast and is easy to add to the daily beauty routine and would recommend it for anyone wanting to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and who wants to minimize the signs of aging.

Olay Total effects 1 week in to using my Olay Total effects and I have noticed a more even skin tone. I have a few dark spots on my face and I have noticed that they have faded. I love how my skin feels after putting on the cream. It's not greasy and you don't need a lot of it. My only complaint is that I wish it was fragrant free. Not a fan of the smell. Thanks Bzz Agent!

"Mixed feelings Well been using it for almost 2 weeks . There is not much difference with my skin accept I feel it not hydrated enough, but I have very dry and sensitiveskin . The one thing I was very impressed is it did not have a itchy or burning feeling so a big plus there for me. I don't have the huge yet to change from my usual brand. But will use it to the end to see if i'll change my mind eventually. Would certainly tell friends to try it to see If they would like it more then me.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer Not for me I received the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer and was excited to try it as I work in retail and we carry the Olay Total Effects line. I have used Olay products in the past and liked how they worked with my skin, so being able to try a new item before it hits the market was great. I am at an in-between age, where my skin had begun to age but not yet displaying many fine lines or wrinkles. That said, the anti-aging properties did not do much for me. I did notice that my pores were visibly smaller, which was great for me as that is a major issue with my skin. My skin tone did have a more even apperance, but I did not notice much in terms of providing any brightness to my skin. The fragrance-free factor was much appreciated as many facial products are overloaded with heavy, unnecessary perfumes. I did find that the moisturizer provided an initial feeling of hydration to the skin, but halfway through the day after an application of makeup, I found the cream was not enough to provide me with sufficient moisture throughout the day. My skin would crack and peel in spite of heavy application of the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer both day and night. Perhaps I'm just not the right skin-type for this item, but I was very happy to try and learn I should save my money. I used the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the duration of the BzzCampaign to be able to provide an accurate account, and I'll stick with a more natural product to stay moisturized.

Hydration PLUS My skin was so dry dull before I found Regenerist Deep Hydration Regeneration Cream. I tried so many products but nothing worked like this amazing product. I love how my skin feels other people ask me about my skin care regime. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"So far so good I've been using this for about 10 days, applying day and night. It goes on very nicely, not greasy at all. It has a pleasant aroma as well. It's fairly moisturizing but if you have dry skin you might want to mix it with your normal moisturizer. I haven't noticed any anti-aging effects yet but I'm guessing it would take a little while longer for that. I'm not sure I would buy the product but I'm going to keep on using it until I run out to see how it goes as my skin seems to like it This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Okay Total Effects Tried Olay Total Effects for a few weeks now. I like applying it straight out of the shower for the best absorption. Otherwise it felt a little bit tacky. Didn't notice much difference as far as pore size, skin brightness or fine line reduction. It did leave my skin feeling moisturizer and soft. I was hoping for better results since I have large pores on my cheeks and forehead. It's a decent moisturizer in line with what I would expect from Olay but it's not a miracle cream. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effects i would want to know how this product is on my skin as I have very sensitive skin. This is an amazing product after using this for a few days I have found my skin to be soft and feels tight. I would have never thought to get this before but now trying it I love it. This vitamin complex has helped with the 7 signs of ageing such as age spots, fine lines. Go check this out :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not to sure yet... I have been using the product for about two weeks now and haven't noticed much difference other than my pores seem less noticeable, but other than that no changes yet, but I think I need to give it some more time as I do enjoy how light it feels on my skin and how it moisturizes ever so lightly with no film left behind, oh AND the delightful smell the cream does have!

"upon second thought although after re reading above i did not yet use the product for 4 straight weeks. so from here formula, Olay Total Effects: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles Evens skin tone appearance Enhances brightness Minimizes the look of pores Visibly reduces age spots Restores firmness Replenishes moisture The result Skin that looks up to 10 years younger after just four weeks. i can say it did replenish moisture and minimize pores but none of the other things happened This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer Review Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer The positive aspects: Light scent that dissipates quickly Fast absorption Blends well with foundation (no caking) The negative aspects for my menopausal skin: Needs to be reapplied 2-3 times a day to keep skin well hydrated No visible signs of changes in the appearance of my pores, fine lines or wrinkles Contains no sunscreen I didnt find this product any different from any other standard moisturizer This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"smooth and silky I love the texture of this product. It feels super smooth and silky upon application. It's light but has a lasting moisturizing power. Unlike other types of serums or anti aging creams I found that this did not feel sticky and it has a very pleasant scent. I've tried it twice a day, morning and night application but never saw a noticeable difference in fine lines. My complexion did look brighter, however since this is advertised as an anti aging product, I expected some better results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effect When I first received the sample, I thought that the bottle was not going to last long since it was so small. But I found that you do not need to use a lot. It goes on easily and smoothly. It's very light and lightly scent (which is great as I can not stand strong scents). After using this product for awhile, my skin is more hydrated and less red. But I do not notice that it has minimize my pores or reduce age spots. Maybe if I continue to use it longer, I will see these benefits too. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Not entirely impressed I have been using Olay Total effects for about 2 weeks now. The one thing I really wanted to see happen while using this product was to have my age spot/sun spot fade. I am not seeing that at all. I do notice my complexion is clearer then normal and my face is not dry (as it usually is at this tim of year) I would reccommend this product as a daily moisturizer but not as an anti aging cream. I am going to continue to use it until I run out ans hopefully I will see some more advantages! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay total effects I have been using this product for a while now and have seen improvements on my skin being moisturized and evening my skin tones. I don't need this cream (for now )for the primarily advertised effects of wrinkles, age spot, etc therefore I cannot speak for those but I do like how a little bit goes a long way as not much cream is needed, which makes the travel size perfect.

"The best hydration product I have used in years. Regenerist Deep Hydration Cream is the best product that I have used. This is the only product of the type that I have used, and have tried many, in over 15 years. I love Olay will continue to use it as long as it is available.

"So far, so good! I have been using Olay Total Effects anti- aging moisturizer for about a week now and I am loving it so far! One thing I have noticed is how soft and moisturized my face feels. I have some fine lines on my cheeks and around my eyes but haven't noticed anything as of yet so I cannot comment on that aspect of the cream but my face looks a little brighter and more pleasant.

"Olay Total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer I have been using this on my face and neck for almost two weeks. I really haven't notice any difference however I do like the smell and I like that it doesn't leave my face oily. I think I will update in another two weeks to see if there has been any progress in my tiny, fine lines that show up when I smile. So far as a moisturizer it's pretty good. olay7in1antiagingmoisturizer This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects This was better than I expected! My skin felt very supple and hydrated which are two big concerns with my skin. Although I would prefer to have unscented, I didn't find the scent to be too strong and it didn't make my skin break out like most scents do. I found my skin to brighten while wearing it but I didn't find my age spots to diminish, nor did any wrinkles. I imagine if I used it longer, it would have more of a difference. I found this moisturizer to make a great primer for under makeup too! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Dissapointed user I really liked this product for the first week or so and then it didn't seemed to keep it's promises. It was great as a moisturizer, but I did not find that it made any difference with the appearance of my skin. Maybe I don't have enough need for the changes that it promises, but I found little or no change. It might work better for someone that has more issues with their skin.

"Olay Olay! I tried Olay total effects a couple weeks ago and although I didn't notice younger looking skin (maybe because I am already a young person), but I did notice that my skin seemed much smoother and softer than normal. It didn't dry my skin out and felt more flexible/elastic if that makes any sense. Also, sometimes I break out when I put creams or makeup on my face so I was a bit hesitant to try it, but I tried it when having several days off from work and I didn't break out once! It was very gentle. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"first time trying Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I have used other Olay skincare production, and this is my first time trying Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I have been using it for about a week now since I received the sample. I use it twice a day. It's easy to absorb, moisturizing, and not greasy. My skin feels very nice and clean. However, maybe because I have not use it long enough, I don't see noticeable difference on my skin texture or appearance yet. Having said that It's a good product and I will continue trying it.

Fire Very good product to use buy it u will no regret smells good makes u look good an feel good as well real talk
"Olay Total Effects I was pretty excited to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, as there's a lot of hype around the product and some positive reviews. The packaging is quite attractive, and the pump top is great for dispensing control and keeping the product fresh. I was concerned with how little product the dispenser produced, but with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, less truly is more. The cream is very thick, rich and luxurious, and you really only need a small amount to get good coverage. It rubs on very smoothly, and does not feel oily or leave residue. It also kept my skin soft and moisturized the whole day. To the drawbacks - I wasn't keen on the scent it was more powerful than I expected initially, and it had a bit of that old lady smell to it. For an anti-aging cream, the smell did not exude youthfulness. Luckily the strong scent faded quickly so I didn't have to smell it all day. Also, I have sensitive skin, and experienced an uncomfortable tingling when I applied the product, as well as some mild skin irritation and reddening (that also, luckily, disappeared after about 20 minutes). After using it for a week, I have not seen any changes in the appearance of my lines or wrinkles, skin tone (worse after initial application...), etc. All in all, I wouldn't replace my current Olay Sensitive Skin daily moisturizer for this one, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin, but it still works decently as a general moisturizing cream. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice, not Great This moisturizer has a nice, light fragrance and feels creamy, but not heavy on the skin. Although it moisturizes nicely, I'm not sure that I saw any great difference in terms of fighting the signs of aging. As a result, I don't think I would seek out this product. Olay's perfecting cream from their Regenerist line, which contains retinol, would be my preferred choice. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not for me This moisturizer goes on bery nicely and absorbed almost immediately. I needed a very small amount to cover my whole face and there was next to no smell. However for the claims they make towards wrinkle reduction, evening tone and making pores appear smaller etc. I really didn't see a difference. It is a good moisturizer but not something I will buy.

Just OK...underwhelmed So my first impression was pretty good. After continued use of this product I just don't notice a difference with signs of aging.. Pros: Smooth texture Provides moisture Non greasy Absorbs well To be available at pharmacys Cons: No visible difference to fine lines No visible brightening No change in skin firmness Overall If I were looking for a product for aging I wouldnt choose this one. If you are looking more for moisture then this may be more up you alley! Just 'ok' in my opinion. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Madmax1974 Gave it a chance, some friends really like Olay and some don't. I have very sensitive skin and have been using a line from La Roche-Posay. Olay Total Effects 7 did not hydrate my skin like my old face cream. The Olay left my skin feeling dry, did not see any improvement in my uneven skin tones or the disappearance of wrinkles. I did offer the rest of my product to 6 different friends before one said yes. No one wanted to try it, not a good sign. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

"Olay Total Effects 6/7 in 1 Anti-aging Overall I will say that I could see 6 out of the 7 results it claims to do. I experienced replenished moisture, skin tone evening,pore reduction, small difference in appearance of tiny lines, I do not have age spots so did not matter but did not see any restoring of firmness. As I said in my last review, I really liked the way it went on and has a great texture. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a great moisturizer that evens out and smooths your skin appearance. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Anti-Aging Moisturizer same olay smell theyve had for years non greasy goes on like its not even there cant say i noticed a difference with it perhaps if i used it longer. didnt notice any difference really in my skin after 7 days but im sure it was well nurished with teh unique vitamin complex that it has in it i probably wouldnt by this product but thats not to say it wont work wonders for someone else This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Pretty average, not greasy I tried Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for 4 weeks and notice that my skin feels noticeably softer than it did when I started. Otherwise, I haven't noticed much of a difference in my skin. I noticed that my skin broke out a little bit more than usual during the 4 weeks, but not too bad. The moisturizer wasn't greasy and was absorbed fairly quickly. The scent was mild and not too perfumy, which is a plus. I would probably opt for the frangrance-free and with sunscreen if given the option. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Light Moisturizer I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer received by BzzAgent for about 2 weeks now. The best thing about this product is that it goes on light and absorbs quickly. I have not seen an improvement in fine lines or skin tone. Actually, my skin seems slightly irritated by this product. It also has a strong perfume smell that I do not think necessary in a moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Feels amazing but doesn't protect I love how my face feels using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It feels smooth and just moist enough. I've had compliments on my skin and it looks good, though I can't say I've less lines. I am disappointed there isn't SPF in it. I always usually wear something with SPF in it, to protect from the sun. And since I'm so pale I wear something with a tint to it and this doesn't have any colour in it. Too bad, otherwise I would wear it daily just because of the way it makes my face feel. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer...Hmm... I've had the product for some time and it's ok. It doesn't have much of an effect on me at all. I think that my skin is a little less dry but other than that there doesn't seem to be much benefit. I'll keep trying it and see if there's any effect with further applications. The product seems to be more like a makeup thing for me. I don't think this would be a priority for me to purchase. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great if your skin is not uber-sensitive I was hoping to really like this as I do like the Olay brand. I have tried some of their facial crams in the past and my skin has not reacted well to them. I was hoping this formulation would be better. My skin ws glowing the first week but on the second I started developing cystic acne on my chin and small breakouts elsewhere. This is the same thing that happened in the past. It's a shame since my friends rave about the brand and I have family members that used the original formulation for years...

"A little bummed out Was pleased to find out that i was chosen to be a Bzz Agent for this product.I was so looking forward at trying Olay total effects moisturizer.Started off by applying the moisturizer every night before bed but after only 4 days, my face broke out with a light rash and pimples.I was so disappointed that i had to stop applying the cream .But what i can say about the product during my 4 day trial,I found the cream a little greasy but was easy to apply.Loved the handy applicator that made the job that much easier.

Great with dry skin I stay out side a lot of time and after each night I use the deep hydration cream and the next morning I get up I feel my skin moist and soft. This is a wonderful product and I been using it over a year. I will be keep using it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
its okay so far Okay total effects seven was given to me to try for free from bzzagent. I've only ever tried moisturizers. It's not included in my daily routine. With this moisturizer you don't need a lot. It spreads smoothly and evenly. The moisturizer isn't sticky or heavy on my skin. I have oily skin so that's important that a moisturizer isn't heavy. The only thing I don't like about Olay total effects is the smell of it on my skin after a while. The initial smell of it smells good. After it dries on my skin it smells unpleasant. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Smells and feels nice on skin I haven't used products from Olay for many years so I was very excited to try this Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I like the smell and how my skin feels, but due to having sensitive skin, I normally prefer my moisturizer to be perfume and colour free. However, this moisturizer has both. I have only used it for a few days and I will see if I will develop an allergic reaction the next few days. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Total Effects 7in1 I think that having used this product my skin texture has improved and is more even toned. I have not had anyone commenting on it but I notice a improvement. My skin feels softer as well. If you have dark spots or uneven skin tone it will give you definite improvements. I haven't noticed a big improvement with less wrinkles but my skin feels tighter. Having tried it first gives you a better advantage. I would buy the product especially for skin texture. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Feels nice, average results I'm fairly new to the anti-aging skincare realm, I've been trying out anti-aging skincare for about 5 years. Since I'm still in my mid-late 20s, I've been battling adult acne occasionally, especially when my hormones are out of whack.. So I've always been using clearing/acne fighting skincare products up until a few years ago when I decided that I could start trying out lighter anti-aging skincare to prevent future wrinkles and aging skin. I've tried several anti-aging moisturizers from different brands and some are too rich for my skin and makes me break out or feels very oily. This moisturizer absorbs really fast and is very light weight, it also did not make me break out. I don't have any wrinkles on my face but I do have visible creasing on my neck that I didn't have when I was younger, so I tried the cream on my neck to see if it would help smooth the lines. After using it for 2 weeks once a day before bed, I didn't see any difference in the lines. It does help moisturize wherever I apply it and absorbs without sticky feeling, but I haven't seen any dramatic changes in my face or neck. My skin doesn't seem like it's any firmer or brighter, nor does my skintone appear more even than before, and my pores still look same as before. It does say that I would need to use the product for at least 4 weeks to see the claimed results, so I will update with another review in 2 weeks! For now though, I feel that it is a nice light weight moisturizer with a light pleasant scent, hopefully it just takes some time to work its magic! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Meh! I hoped for more! I really could not wait to receive this item.. But I must say I was sadly disappointed when I found that it did not do anything :( I have really dry skin and my face burns when I get out of the shower so I was really hoping that this was going to be the maricle cream I was looking for.. But it was not! I found that I had to apply a large amount of cream on my face before it actually felt that it was doing anything. The smell of the cream was not bad so that was one bonus. So would I go out and actually buy this product Hmm no not really.. Sorry! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Works great when using it only I was very excited to try Total Effect as I saw its commerical and advertisement for a long time. Using it for night time as a cream works great. However, this trial size version does not have any sun protection. So I have to put on the Total Effect, wait about 5 minutes. Then I put on sunscreen. For the first 2-3 hours, it worked. However, it starts to form flakes or when I have to do any touch up on my makeup. Using the sunscreen alone with my usual moisture, I did not have such problem. So, I only use it for night time now.

"Nice even skin tone I have to be honest, I LOVE moisturizers. I have tried many in the past and I have to say I was not that impress with this one. It does unify the skin tone and moisturize it but I did not notice anything else special. Not a big difference for the wrinkles which I was looking for. I had heard many good comments about this lotion in the past so I will definitely give it another chance but for now I'm am not too impress. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Not as much difference as I thought it might have After my first review and two and half weeks later. I did notice my skin was smoother but I don't have any wrinkles or fine line to see any reduction in that area. I also notice there is some reduction in the size of my pores. But nothing dramatic. I don't have any age spots so I couldn't see if there is any improvement in that area. Overall I think this product is O.K. I would somewhat recommend it to others.

"nice moisturizer I reviewed this earlier in the campaign and was happy with the moisturizer- I don't use any heavy moisturizers so this was exactly right for my skin type. I used it till it ran out-- almost a month-- it was not greasy and did not make my skin oily quickly. but that said..... I really don't see any changes in my skin -- age spots -hmmm still there.... fine lines..sigh -- still there. so , yes it is a really nice moisturizer , very subtle smell , the pump allowed me to get an amount that was enough for me each time.. but the other claims not so much. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Decent product Honestly I only use a day cream with at least an SPF of 25 so for that reason, I can say I would not purchase this particular formula. I would be interested in trying the one with SPF. Over all it seems to work well. Soaks in my skin immediately and leaves it feeling hydrated. I do have a very oily T-Zone and very dry patches on my jawline. Therefor I did have to use another moisturizer on that dry area as I was just not getting enough moisture with the Olay. Other than that, seems like a good product just may not be for my skin and out door lifestyle. :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This is exactly what I've needed. I like everything about this product This product made my skin feel softer and seemed to make my facial lines much less visible. This product has a pleasant smell and doesn't disappear quickly like other products I have used.b This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Enjoyed the product I enjoyed using this Olay product. I liked the fragrance, and the way it made my skin feel moisturized without feeling greasy or oily. I'm not sure how well the product fought the seven signs of aging, as the sample size I received didn't give me enough to use it for a period that enabled me to see any difference in my skin tone, fine lines, etc. I do know that in stores, this product can be very pricey, so I'm not sure I'd spend the money unless I knew for sure that it would make a difference. But overall, using this product was a pleasant experience. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Fantastic moisture but the rest I have been using Olay Total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer and it could be that I just didn't have enough in the sample to fully utilize the 4 weeks as they say but I have not found much of a change. Sure it moisturizes like a dream which is what ever girl needs and it does help to improve evenness of tone but I did not find the change I was looking for regarding fine lines and brightness. Perhaps I will purchase just to try for the 4 weeks and see if there is truly a change as suggested after that This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder I have had the chance to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moiturizer and here are my thoughts: PRO: Not greasy is light on my skin. I do not feel like I have put any cream on my face, it has helped moisturize my dry areas (forehead and beside my nose) with the colder weather coming in. Light scent when applying that does not linger. Goes on smooth. CON: It has caused my chin to break out quite a bit when this is not a problem I often have, as well as the bridge of my nose (less noticeable on my nose though) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Fighting the signs of aging Three days after using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 moisturizer, two pimples pop up on my face. I am saddened as it has this kind of effect on me. Luckily, nothing more showed up. On the brighter side, after a week of using Olay, I noticed that it minimizes the look of my pores and makes my skin feel smooth and soft. Looking forward to look younger in another week with the help of the unique vitamin complex it contain. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not a bad lotion, needs sunscreen! I have definitely noticed a few changes after using this Olay lotion for a few weeks. I have dry skin and the lotion is very moisturizing. Thankfully I don't have fine lines, wrinkles or age spots (yet!), but it did make my skin brighter and evened out my skin tone. I also thought it smelled great. I only gave it three stars because it would be better if the lotion also had sunscreen. I also noticed the price was significantly higher than other products in store. So overall, I am not sure if I will continue to use this lotion. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
It was alright I would want to know that this product really did reduce fine lines before I actually bought it. I received this product free to try and did so for two weeks straight. I was hoping to see a difference because it felt really nice going on my face but I didn't. My skin did feel nice after putting it on but I did not see any difference on my fine lines and age spots which may be because I haven't used it long enough yet.

"Great feel to the skin, although, the smell ... While I like the feel and the how light the feel of the product is, I do not like the smell. Although, it is not overwhelming I disliked it so much I made a point of not putting the product under my nose and avoided wearing it at night to avoid getting it on my pillow. That being said I did like the feel of my skin after using it and would be will to continue to use it, however, I would prefer if there was an unscented version.

"Olay Total Effects 7 is not for Me I think this product might be fine for someone with more normal skin. My skin tends to be a little on the dry side and I find it does not provide enough moisture. In fact it almost seems drying. I have been using it for a week now and have not noticed any real benefit to my skin. On the plus side it has a very mild scent. Not overpowering which is super important to me and it goes on nice and smooth. Again this product is not for me, but if I had normal to oily skin I would definitely give it a try olaytotaleffects7 gotitfree This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Off to good start So I have used the Olay Total effects 7 for 3 days now. I have already noticed my pores are getting smaller. It does have a scent so those people with allergies try a unscented version. The one downfall is my skin gets very greasy compared to normal. I do have oily skin, but not this bad. Don't get me wrong I have not broken out or anything. My crows feet seem a little fainter. Can't wait to continue the product for the whole month. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Skin is softer After 7 days I notice that my face is much softer. I have quite dark age spots, and they do not seem any lighter after 7 days. I wish that I would have gotten a full bottle to try since the claim is to notice a difference in 4 weeks. I like that the moisturizer does not have a strong smell.. I don't really think I can give a really good review since I only tried it for 7 days, and not the 4 weeks that Olay says the product works in. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Wonderful I have severe dry skin, especially on my forehead. This is the best hydrating cream, wrinkle reducer ever! And a very reasonable price. I've been using Olay products since for 20 years and this is the best one, yet. Thank you Oil of Olay!"
"Worth trying! I received a sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and tried it for a little over a week and a half. I loved the dispenser, the texture of the moisturizer and the scent. If it weren't for my skin being so dry from the cold winter weather, this moisturizer may have made more of a noticeable difference. I'm guessing that using it did help prevent the condition of my skin from getting worse as the temperatures dropped. I will try it again in the spring and so I can see the real benefits of using this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Wrinkles be gone I'll be honest, when I first received Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer I wasn't impressed with the scent. Once I began using the product though, it wasn't as strong on my skin as I thought it would be. Then the wrinkles started to fade around my eyes and I was all of a sudden craving the scent I had first disliked. This moisturizer goes on smooth and keeps your skin hydrated through the day. I used both day and night and didn't even notice the winter dryness I usually succumb too. All in all I would probably buy it again! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"An expensive moisturizer The original reason for me to try out this product was to reduce my pore size, moisturize and even skin tone. It did moisturize my face, which made it feel nice and soft. The smell was very nice as well. All the other things it is said to do, it didn't do. I was really rooting for it to work but unfortunately all it did was make me break out with bad acne. I used it every day, only missing it once. I love the Olay brand but this product did not work for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"First Impressions Lost Hopes held high i faithfully applied Olay Total Effects til the sample was empty. What i found was that the initial application feels great, moisturizing and elasticizing dry skin. It quickly absorbs. After about 14 days, my skin (which is normal to dry), began showing a reaction on my forehead, little bumps. Not too noticeable, but a little itchy. I am not one to give much attention to my skin or especially spend on products. So a 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a lot of promise for one product. cant say i'm sold to start buying on a regular basis. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Totally Effective Day 1 of trying this product out and mostly good things to say. I love the little pump, which helps distribute the product easily and doesn't waste. The smell is amazing, although I do understand there is a fragrance free option for those who are sensitive to smell. The moisturizer went on smooth but I did find it left a little bit of a greasy texture in certain areas of the face. Perhaps it's just me. Overall my face feels smooth and hydrated. It may take up to 4 weeks to notice results as far as aging effects go, so I will be back again for another review. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Give it some time... So my first review was after a week of using the product. Now that I have used it for a couple weeks, I have come to notice it starting to take effect. My skin feels so much smoother and softer. I don't believe I really had much aging, but I do feel more beautiful and confident. My skin breakout around the end of the first week, but that seems to have cleared up since. I also love that it is non-greasy, literally. So many products claim this, but this one has lived up to it. I can't wait to see how my face looks at the end of the 4 weeks... maybe I'll look 20 again LoL This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"It was okay The sample was pretty small, so it's hard to give it a good review as I didn't get a chance to use it for very long. The product felt very light on my face which is a good thing. The scent was pleasant as well. I did notice a difference around my eyes. I seemed to look a bit more awake. I did break out over the few days I was using it.I can't tell if it was because of the product or other reasons. Overall I would recommend the product to friends as Olay is brand I really trust. Their brand is the only thing I put on my face and get compliments on my skin all the time. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects I think that it had a great scent, went on easily, wasn't thick or stick, had a nice texture and overall was a nice product. I found that it covered pores nicely but not so much the fine lines around my eyes. Not sure if its 'anti aging' more of a concealer. Maybe if I used the product longer but I'm sure if I want to get ride of fine lines then a more drastic approach is needed. But I did like everything about this product for a temporary solution and would definitely buy. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Decent Product, but Nothing Amazing... I've been an Olay fan for a lot of years. That being said, although I liked the texture of this moisturizer and how it made my skin feel, I can't say that I would go out of my way to buy it. In my personal opinion, their perfecting cream from the Regenerist line is a superior product. The latter contains retinol, the potent form of Vitamin A that dermatologists say is the most effective in fighting wrinkles and the signs of aging. From what I could tell by carefully reading the packaging, this Total Effects moisturizer doesn't contain the same active ingredient... This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"first day trying this hi everyone, this is my first day trying this product. i used it last night before bed and i liked it. i am 42 years old and have combination skin with a few dark spots around my chin. i hope this can help even out my coloring and maybe reduce the look of some of my pores and wrinkles. i have mild acne i would like to see gone too lol. when i woke up this morning, the dry spots on my cheeks didn't seem as bad and my skin seemed softer. i hope this helps with my issues. i liked it wasn't greasy and one pump of the product was enough for my face. i'll keep you posted :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
I've really seen results I've used Olay products for over 15 yrs. I started using the Regeneration line about a yr ago. I tried other products but never got better results. I've learned to stick with what works! Thanks Olay you haven't let me down. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer...Alright I've been using the product for a while and I'm not overly impressed. While I think that my face is slightly more moisturized I don't know if there's really any 'anti-aging' going on with it. I didn't really say any noticeable difference apart from being slightly less dry. It hasn't taken away any wrinkles or smoothed any out. I am not really sure what they were going for in this product. At the end of the day you can't really undo what nature does anyway. I didn't have the expectation of miracles but I had expected more than just a moisturizing effect. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Not what I expected When I received this sample, I'm not sure what I expected. I'm a red head and my skin is fair, smooth, and with freckles. I began using this and I did notice that the dark circles under my eyes began to diminish slightly. I did not experience my face becoming smoother or fighting the signs of aging. When I have looked at products like this in the store, I have never thought of purchasing them on my own. The cost is too high when my skin is already fairly nice. Now, by no means is my skin perfect, but I haven't had acne, I don't have scarring, and except the second tone being my freckles my skin is fairly even. If I were to go out looking for this product, I would want to know what consumer it was targeted for. Is it supposed to work for everyone Is it preventative or reparative. Maybe in my mind I thought it was going to make me glow, make my face soar into a new level of beauty. Alas, the product did help keep the dry air away from my skin but that's something that a less expensive body cream or moisturizer could have done. If you are looking for something because your skin is in poor condition, I think this would be a great product. If you're looking for something because you want your skin to be soft and stay that way for a longer period, sure this may be it. If you're like me, fair skinned and freckled with no wrinkles (yet, anyway), I wouldn't bother spending your budget on an expensive product like this.

"Sample size too small I like Olay products and have been using them for years, but this particular trial was a bit of a disappointment. The sample size was too small and in this dry weather took me less than two weeks to use. Also, I normally use unscented (sensitive) formulations and wasn't a big fan of the scent. I found the texture nice and the moisturizing was great. I didn't have a skin reaction, always a plus, but would have preferred a full-sized sample to be able to comment on longer term use and value. As it was, the sample made my Bzzing less profound and less meaningful. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
It's great for some. I really did enjoy the way the Olay Total 7 effects felt like on my face. Unfortunately i found it to be a little to oily for my skin type. It's great for the winter months for those dry winds but I'm afraid in the summer I would feel it. As for it's wrinkle fighting properties. Well I didn't really notice much difference on the lines on my forehead. Overall I really wanted to love this lotion and it does have a lot to brag about it was just not right for myself. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"It is interesting I have combination skin. Prior to using this I used moisturizer and washed with soap and water. I replaced the moisturizer with the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1. I have noticed my skin feels softer seems more even toned. Word of warning, if you have blemishes it stings like mad upon application! Seems to do the trick as a moisturizer but I haven't noticed any reduction of fine lines or the sort. Being in my early 30s I do not currently have many wrinkles though so who knows. Overall my thoughts are that its a nice product but I'll stick with my moisturizer. Just doesn't seem worth the extra cost This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So far so good Well I have been using it now for 2 and a half weeks now. I can't say I have noticed any difference in my skins appearance. I do like the texture of the product it goes on my skin nicely very easy to distribute across my face and neck. The smell is ok. I like the pump on the product it distributes the perfect amount for me. I usually have problems using different cream, meaning I break out. With the Olay Total Effects I did not break out in pimples or a rash so thats great!! haha I am not a fan of cream with SPF in it but that is my preference. I can see how that would appeal to other people though. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Winter needs moisturuzer That goes best with winter Olay Total Effects 7in 1 anti-aging moisturizer and here is why. Not only can Olay total effects helps with the normal everyday problems age spots, uneven completion, fine lines and wrinkles but when winter is throwing down a beating Olay can also help bring much needed moisture to your face. Freezing cold and wind equal dry skin. Olay total effect also has unscented and one with SPF 15. I totally would buy the one with SPf 15 than you are covered year around usolay gotitfree This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Skin that looks up to 10 years younger in 4 weeks Not quite. I first gave the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer a 4 out of 5 upon my first review of the product. I'm now giving it a 3 out of 5 as I was hoping to see more results as time went on, but unfortunately I didn't see any further results. The moisturizer is pink in color, and in between that of a lotion and cream in consistency. This moisturizer is oil-free, fast absorbing, dries with a matte finish, scented, pink in color, and contains the anti-aging vitamins B3, B5, and E. I'm not a huge fan of scented facial moisturizers so I'm glad this also comes in a fragrance-free version as well as a version with added sunscreen. I have blemish-prone skin and this did not cause any problems for my skin. This moisturizer didn't absorb into my skin right away. It took a few hours before I'd feel the hydration to my skin, but once my skin absorbed it my face felt nicely moisturized. This product claims 7 benefits including minimizing pore size and smoothing out fine lines and wrinkles. The claim is that your skin will look up to 10 years younger in just 4 weeks. I've used this for more than 4 weeks and the only things I've noticed is an increase in my skin's radiance and more hydrated skin. I think that one would have to use this product for more than 4 weeks to notice age spot and wrinkle reduction. The 15 mL trial sized format (which I got to try for free from BzzAgent and will be in stores in February) is great for those who are unsure about committing to the full sized 50 mL of this product.

"Not really up my alley After over a month of trying Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I haven't really seen much of a change since the first two weeks. In the first two weeks, I though my few lines did look better. However, I do not feel as though they have gotten Even better from then. I am only 32 years old and have very few wrinkles as it is, but I am sure that with continued daily use, wrinkles would not get worse. I will say though that my skin has never felt softer and my complexion was never once bothered by this cream. It has a nice scent and is very light and nice to put on. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not sure yet I was very happy to receive my sample and it was perfect timing for me since I was running out of my usual moisturizer.This is a nice every day moisturizer. I really liked the sample size. The fragrance is also very nice, not too strong. The cream is a little bit thick in texture but is easily spreadable on the face. It is not greasy . I used this product for 2 weeks but I've had to stop using it because I got pimples on the face and they disapeared few days after stopping this cream... So I cannot really say if the product really helps with reduction in fine lines and wrinkles ... This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Dewey Fresh Silky Smooth Skin When I put this on my skin feels like silk. My face looks dewey fresh and there is absolutely no need for foundation. I never go out with out it. My skin looks youthful and fresh. It's all I need to start my day off right. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Decent Moisturizer Overall, this product is a decent moisturizer. It has a nice, light finish and provides a good finish. As far as the anti-aging benefits, it is difficult to evaluate as I would be using this more as a preventative measure as opposed to trying to minimize existing lines and wrinkles. I'm not there yet. I haven't noticed a decrease in the visibility of my pores, and my current moisturizer does a better job of brightening my skin and relieving dullness. It's a good moisturizer for the price point and Olay has a great reputation. I would probably use it if I didn't like my current brand so much. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great product.....just not for me Is I had the opportunity to try this product from Oil of Olay. It provides 7 benefits in one product, which it makes it a great alternative to layering multiple products. I liked the texture, but for someone with dry skin like myself, I found that it did not hydrate my skin well enough. I did notice an improvement with the texture in my skin. It because it didn't hydrate me enough, I still had quite noticeable fine lines. Would love to see a dry skin version, especially for the winter months.

"Mediocre changes I have been using Olay total effects for two consecutive weeks now. I absolutely love that the moisturizer part of it does not make my skin feel greasy. I also notice a more balanced appearance in my skin tone as well as smaller pores- can't go wrong with that! All in all my only true disappointment is that my fine lines are still here. Which, to be honest is what I was most looking forward to. If you need a skin balancer with a great moisturizer and tighter feel upon application, try this!

"Great but perfumy! After just a few days of using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I noticed that my skin was definitely more plump, it felt moisturized and the pores were definitely less visible. However, I found the product to be overly scented. In order to validate whether that my wrinkles were diminished or my skin looked younger, I believe that I would need to have used the product for longer that a month . I would definitely give this product another try as an unscented product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"i made me look and feel yonger when I received olay total effects in the mail I was a little disappointed it was just a sample size, I didn't think it would last long enough for me to see the results, at first I noticed how moisturizing it is, I like that and after using it for about a week a noticed a few little tiny pimples, no big deal I thought I was 15 again, but then I got a big one that actually hurts and now its going to be in my Christmas cards for this year, well if that doesn't make you look and feel younger, what does, right by the way, my mom loved it and I am buying a full size for her once it comes out This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Didnt like the feeling at night - will try for daily use I was very excited to try out this product when it arrived. I started applying it every evening when I went to bed and was happy at first with the product. Unfortuantely after trying it a number of times I was unhappy with how it felt on my skin. I did not have a reaction to theproduct but it felt heavy on my skin as I am unused to putting on a cream in the evening. I have stopped using it in the evening and have decided to try to use it in the morning now instead - perhaps my skin will feel better wearing it during the daytime.

"Olay 7 in 1 moisturizer I've been using this product for almost a week now.So far I haven't seen any notable difference to my fine lines, but hey I'm only 28 so there's not much to work with -) I have however noticed my skin is so much softer! At the very least it is a great moisturizer! Another added bonus...I have acne prone skin and almost any moisturizer I put on my face is too oily and causes breakouts, but so far no pimples!Yay! Super excited about that :-) So overall again not seeing any results with my fine lines Yet, but my skin looks and feels great! I'm looking forward to updating in a couple weeks with more awesome results :-) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects I liked this product as a moisturizer . I've been using it for about four weeks now but I didn't find it did what it said it was going to. it didn't make me look 10 years younger at all lol. I have sensitive skin so when I tired it I thought my face might break out but it didn't, so it's great for people with sensitive skin and it's also great as a moisturizer but I wouldn't recommend people buying it expecting your skin to change it's appearance. maybe it's just me but my skin still looks the same, just not as dry. And for the size of the bottle it goes along way because you only need to use a little dab of it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Total effect sting I think overall this is a great product if my skin was not sensitive due to winter weather. I tried it several times but was not able to use on a regular basis as it made the skin on my face sting. I am not sure if It was due to the perfume scent in the product. If they offered it to me again without the perfume I would be more than willing to try it. I was not thrilled with the scent anyways and am not sure if it is necessary in moisturizer. Unfortunately I did not use enough to notice a big change in my skin. I look forward to reading the review of other users and would love to try again if it was unscented.

"Made my skin break out. I have always been a fan of Olay moisturizers thanks to my grandmother who uses it regularly to date, me, not so regularly. She has amazing skin which gets her compliments to date. I have been using mostly the classic Olay products on and off, so I was excited to be able to try Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 for free without having to buy it. I was also happy to read this works well for sensitive skin, so less It made my skin feel amazingly soft and wonderful like all the reviews I read unfortunately after a couple of days of using it, my skin started breaking out. I am a little sad but I guess it's just not for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"This product has worked so well. This product has made such a difference that a lot of my friends have noticed that I have less wrinkles and my skin appears much younger looking, more fresh and even toned. Best product I have used.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer I recently received the opportunity to try out Olay Total Effects Anti-aging Moisturizer complimentary of bzzagent and I'm not completely happy with my experience so far. Yes, it is definitely moisturizing, but anti aging I'm not quite sure about. I really haven't seen as much change in my skin as I hoped after using it for a few weeks. The fragrance is a little too strong for me, and lingers around for a while. However, I will continue to use it and see if my opinion changes about this product in the next couple of weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice Moisturizer I found Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer to be a nice moisturizer, but haven't noticed an anti-aging effect. For me, the scent was too strong, but I see that you can also get it in a fragrance free formula, which would definitely appeal to me more. We have cold, dry winters and my skin tends to get dry and even flaky at times during this time of year and I have had noticeably smooth and hydrated skin this year. I gave this product a 3/5 because of the strong scent and also because I haven't noticed any anti-aging effects, but I would recommend it to anyone looking for a moisturizer that enjoys scented products. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"another good product from Olay I had to stop using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, because my face became itchy broke out after a week. It may be due to the light fragrance. It's just not right for MY skin type, but it did produce quick results for 5 of 7 signs of aging. The unique vitamin complex lessened redness and evened and brightened my skin immediately. The texture is silky and seems to plump fine lines. I was looking forward to using this to help with age spots in particular, but my skin didn't react well. I love the Olay brand, so I will try this again in a sensitive or fragrance free version. Overall, a good moisturizer, not great. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Heavy for younger skin Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles Evens skin tone appearance Enhances brightness Minimizes the look of pores Visibly reduces age spots Restores firmness Replenishes moisture But i find it a bit too greasy and heavy for my skin. I am 38 years old and i have a normal sensitive skin. When i put it on the first week i found it was to heavy for a day cream, so i used it as a night cream. When i put it during the day i found that im too shinny even with my makeup on. But for a night cream is awsome. I feel nice and refresh when i get up in the morning. I would definitely recommend this cream to my older friends with dry skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"olay review ok it has been about 2 weeks since i have been using this lotion. first i would like to say i really do not see any difference in my wrinkles, but then again i really don't have a lot of wrinkles. i do notice my skin has a more even tone and my darker spots have been reduced. i also have less dryness around my cheeks. i do like the scent and i like that my face feels softer. i did not see an improvement in any breakouts, but i did notice the pores on my nose seem to be smaller. i also talked about the cream with a few people and i said i would recommend it for evening out dark spots and reducing pores. i'll keep you posted :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer i really like Olay, i have used many of their different products. i received the sample size of the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer, and put it to use. I have used it daily, i like that there is no oily residue and it goes on very nicely. It also smells nice, not over scented. I personally have not noticed a difference in my skin, such as the reduction of fine lines and evening of skin tone, that being said i would still consider using it for face lotion. It doesnt interfere with make up and is not super heavy. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice product, think I need more time to see anti-aging effects I have been using this product for about a month now. It feels really nice on my skin, goes on smooth and non-greasy. There is no irritation and is pretty moisturizing on my combination skin. However, I didn't notice any anti-aging effects. My skin appeared no better or worse after one month of use. Maybe it takes longer to show I am 39 with pretty good skin aging wise for my age but I still have plenty of fine lines and my pores are starting to show more. I didn't notice any difference with that and I took a couple of pictures at the beginning to compare. Maybe it's better for skin that has more signs of aging This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effects I have never used any thing for my face except water, so I thought I would give this a try, I started to use the 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer, and I have noticed a little bit of a difference my face looks healthier it feels like it bounces back if I touch it and i really like the way my face looks. I have not had a problem with aging marks but my skin tone does seam more on the even side. This does take more then a day or two to start noticing the change in you skin but with the results I see it is well worth it, a nice bounce back, beautiful tone you won't have to wear any cover up you can go natural.

"My Take on Olay Effects Thanks for the sample of Olay Effects. I really like the scent of the product. I have been using it now for almost 2 weeks but have not really seen a difference in my skin, I will keep using it for another couple of weeks. I have not noticed any change in the one age spot that I have even after using it for this amount of time. It does make my skin feel nice and soft and I like that it is not greasy. I'm glad I got to try the sample before spending the money on the full sized product, I'm still not sure whether or not I will buy it. As I noted above I will continue using it to see what the results are. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects! I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for just over 3 weeks now. I enjoy how the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer contains Vitamins B3, B5 and E. I have very sensitive skin and at first my skin reacted to using the moisturizer, but as I continued to use it, it got a bit better. I did not notice chances in my skin tone nor firmness, I did notice my face feels better moisturized and my skin feels softer. All in all this product is ok, but I would not personally purchase it as it is not great for sensitive skin, however it moisturizes all day and has multiple vitamins. to help your skin.

Dry climate Fix I live in Tucson AZ and the dryness can cause one to become lizard like in skin texture if not hydrated. So I needed a face cream that would be hydrating but still allow the skin to breathe. This is the best I have used! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"i wish i had more I was happy to get this trial size 15ml of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer but very disappointed that there was barely enough to use for 10 days, I used one small squirt of the cream for the areas that needed it and I did see some results promised which are 1.Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles 2.Evens skin tone appearance 3.Enhances brightness 4.Minimizes the look of pores 5.Visibly reduces age spots 6.Restores firmness 7.Replenishes moisture I truly love Oil of Olay and was glad I was given the opportunity to get a trial size.

"Decent anti-aging product This is pretty decent product for its price. I wouldn't say it is one of the first line products out there, but definitely has its place for the average Jane's who care about their skins yet don't want to spend too much money. It has nice texture and it does improve the appearance of your skin somewhat. It doesn't all of sudden make you look like you are teenager when you are in your 40s, but even botox couldn't do that anyway. I like the smell and I like how my skin FEELS after using this. Overall I would recommend but don't expect any miracle. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Maybe 4 in 1... but definitely not 7 in 1 I got to try out the new trial size of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 almost consistently over the past 3 weeks. I really wish I took a before and after picture to compare, but didn't think of it until it was too late. When it comes to my face routine, I usually like simple as I'm a self-proclaimed Lazy Girl. I usually would moisturize my face with coconut oil twice a day, after washing, so I incorporated the Olay moisturizer in once a day in the evenings before bed. Every morning I would notice my skin is softer from the added moisture. The winter season is usually quite drying. I also saw that my skin tone is even, my freckles (or age spots) are gone and that my pores on my nose are a bit smaller (this is huge for me as I have massive pores). Unfortunately, since it is winter, I'm not too sure if my age spots fading are actually due to the fact that I'm not in the sun as much, as it's dark by 4 and when it is light out it's overcast/raining or from Olay Total Effects. One more note is that the fragrance is horrendous. It smells just like the Olay Regenerist product, and I'm not a fan. My husband is not a fan either he can't stand smell! It smells like it's for my grandmother's generation or something like that. All-in-all, it's an alright product, and great for traveling, but I don't think I would go out and purchase this for myself. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Okay Olay... I decided to try the Olay Total Effects skin care product because I have never gravitated toward the Olay brand and was curious to see if it would entice me to purchase Olay products in the future. I have also always affiliated the Olay brand with age and wrinkle reducing effect which have not been my concern. When using this product I didn't consider its effects on fine lines and wrinkles, pores or age spots as these do not concern me. However, I was interested to see the role this product plays in replenishing moisture and providing even skin tone. I used this product before applying my makeup and I did notice a different to the appearance of my skin - it seemed brighter and even. However, the moisture factor did not wow me. The scent and texture of the product is light but would prefer a thicker cream to provide more moisture. I prefer to use a day moisturizer which includes SPF and this product does not encourage me to use it during the day. I am more comfortable using this product during the day if I don't intend to go outside. Also, I don't like using this product before bed as it does not meet my night cream expectations as it promises effects that would be reasonable during the day and not during sleep. Unfortunately, I don't plan to purchase this product for my own needs but would consider purchasing it as a gift for someone concerned with all 7 areas of skin care.

"I've had better I've used quite a few anti-aging creams. Olay Total Effects 7, in my opinion is mediocre. It definitely moisturizes as advertised. However I do not notice any visible difference so far in my skin other than a slight irritation on my face. I started getting little bumps all over my face after 2 days of use. It is highly perfumed so I don't think this product is for sensitive skin. I use Olay Daily Moisturizer everyday under my makeup and it never causes any irritation. This just is not for my skin type. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A fairly good moisturizer.. So, I've used this cream everyday for about a month now. My skin is normally somewhat dry and tight feeling after showering. I found that this product moisturised my skin well and lasted throughout the day. It's not greasy and absorbs fairly quickly. I noticed a slight change in the brightness of my skin, mostly right after use. Although I didn't expect miracles to happen, I noticed no change in any fine lines. Perhaps after a longer period of use I give this product 3 stars, mainly for how it makes my skin feel. It's a fairly nice moisturizer, but that's about it. I'll use what's left of my free trial, but I'll be moving on to something else. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizing cream I was very excited to try this product. Being 28 yrs old I'm now starting to get fine lines around my eyes, and I'm a little self conscious about them. While the product was a great moisturizer I didn't notice any difference with my fine lines in the month I used it. Definitely don't look 10 years younger! I'm extremely disappointed in that aspect. I didn't notice any difference in the appearance of my pores, skin tone, or firmness of my skin either. So overall aside from being a good moisturizer I don't think this product delivered as stated.... For me at least. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not a lot of changes yet So far I have been using Olay for just a short time. I have not noticed any big changes and no one has come up to me to make any comments. However, I have noticed that my face feels softer. I have also noticed that I have a couple blemishes that are not going away. One is on my cheek and one on my chin since have been using it. I would like it better if it was also combined with a foundation so it would save a step as I dot always have time to myself for simple things like this. It would make it easier first thing in the morning to put on and go out for the day. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer I've written a review in the early weeks of being able to try the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer and didn't really have any results so I thought I'd give it a few more weeks before I wrote another review to see if anything changes. Thought this product is super moisturizing I haven't really seen any change in my skin. I use it as directed but with few to little results that I've seen at least. The fragrance was a little over powering at first, it still is but I'm getting used to it. Will I buy this product after being able to try it, probably not. But I still love other Olay products.

"Silky soft skin When I first seen Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer I thought there is no way this works. I have tried many products in the past. My face care consisted of a few different products so I thought what the hay let try it. At first thought it feel light and has a nice smell that isn't overpowering. When I applied it to my face I was surprised how light it felt. It dried quickly and did not leave my face feeling heavy or greasy, it also wasn't shinny. Once it dried it did not seem to smell anymore either. Olay total effects was no match for my uneven skin tone within 4 weeks my face looked healthier and I had a more even skin tone and no age spots to be seen. My pores do look smaller. I didn't notice my skin any tighter but with all the other great things about this product it still comes out on top There unique vitamin complex definitely Made a huge difference in the look and feel of my skin. Another huge bouns is instead of an anti-wrinkle cream, moisturizer, age spot cream,toner and even sunscreen you can have one product. The one I received free did not have the sunscreen but they have that as well as in unscented one. I also wanted to mention I have sensitive skin so I was surprised that I had no issues with Olay total effects. I would recommend this product to friends and family This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Dependable There is nothing more satisfying than knowing after you purchase a product based off their description that it actually holds true. I have seen avid results and feel confident the rest of the products will show the same. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Good moisturizer I enjoyed using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. The smell is pleasant without being too perfumy and my face feels nice and smooth after using. The moisturizer isn't oily or greasy feeling. A little goes a long a way. I can't really comment on the moisturizers ability to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, restore firmness or reduce age spots since I don't have any. I can however comment on my pores appearing smaller and my face feeling moisturized even after a long day. I will continue using the moisturizer until I finish the bottle, but it is one that I will probably not purchase. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Totally Olay! I am fairly new to the world of anti- aging products. I have yet to see the signs of aging on my face *knocks on wood*, so this is really the first time I've tried an anti-aging product. Because of this, it was difficult to detect whether this product was truly fighting signs of aging for me. If you are considering buying the product, it goes on smooth and the smell is fresh and not over bearing. Personally, I don't like the feel of greasy moisturizer on my skin, but this product wasn't too thick and oily. It did make my face feel smooth and fresh. It is probably a good preventative measure for me to take, but I likely won't buy it for the next few years. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not really for me You would think that, at the age of 45, pimples would be a thing of the past. Every time I applied this Olay product, I would get one yucky pimple...on my nose...every time!. Now I can say that I noticed my skin had a smoother, silky looking appearance and the age spots on my cheeks faded a bit, but the nose pimple sorta negated that smoothness - who notices a wrinkle-free forehead when my nose is as red as Rudolph's I never have issues with Olay products so I was surprised by this reaction. I am glad I got to try it before I bought a full-sized bottle that went to waste. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Dry skin be gone! I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the past two weeks. First off, I like how the cream absorbs into your skin quickly and feels smooth afterwards. Truthfully, my lines are still there don't think those will ever disappear. No cream can do that. But the Olay cream is very nice and has a subtle scent. I have noticed my dry skin has disappeared and so I think this product is perfect for our dry winters. Skin tone does look even and I found my face to be smoother. The only downside to this is no SPF. If they had an SPF in it, this would be the perfect moisturizer. Hey maybe they'll make a separate one in the future! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effects 7-in-1 moisturizer There are some pros and come regarding this product. I have been using this moisturizer for about a week now and I have noticed some things that I like. It keeps my skin soft, (especially during this dry-prone season), without leaving my face oily or greasy feeling or looking. It has also helped the appearance of dark areas under my eyes, and to overall brighten my skin tone. Other than that I have not noticed much difference in the appearance of my pores or fine lines around my mouth. In conclusion I would give this product 3.5/5 stars as it is not a miricle worker, but perhaps with continued use further results may appear. Definitely worth giving a try. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Some visable results I have only been using the cream for 3 weeks, but I notice some improvements in my skin tone. There is less redness. I think to observe noticeable difference in age spots, I would need to continue use of the product beyond 4 weeks, since over the counter products take longer to reduce the appearance of age spots in comparison to prescription products, and those do not promise results as early as 4 weeks. It is a thicker cream, so I would suggest only using it in the evenings if you have oily skin and wear make-up. Because this is a available in most retail stores, and is an Olay product, I know that it will be an affordable solution to many for aging. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good but not great! I think that the Olay total effects was good but not great. It was nice enough and light, but didn't deliver any of its promises despite me using on a regular basis. I was disappointed mostly because I had high hopes with such a reputable brand. Maybe the trial size wasn't enough to tell It didn't make me break out which was nice as my skin is sensitive to breakouts with most creams. I would maybe try it again but I use the term maybe lightly depending on the cost of the full size product. It just didn't deliver anything to make me want to spend on it in the future! Smell wasn't bad, although my significant other said I smelt like an old lady! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Olay total effects 7 Ok so I have been using this for about 2.5 weeks now. I have been using this everyday once a day during that time. What I have noticed is that my skin is moisturized. It says it reduces fine lines well I didn't really have any to begin with. I really noticed that the dark circles under the eye were reduced so pleased with that. I did find it made my pores even smaller but disappointed if didn't help with the dark spots on my cheeks from sun damage which by the way it has a sunscreen in it of SPF 15 which I do like. You can also by the full size of Olay where you normally shop! The trail size will be available in February!

Skin is less dry I have sensitive skin but I've liked Olay products in the past and was happy to try this one. The first few days it burned a bit and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to keep using it but it may be that my skin was just dry because after that it was fine. I don't usually like scented products but this has a light and nice smell to it. I didn't notice a huge difference in my skin except that it was less dry in winter so I agree it moisturizes but I didn't see any other benefits after 2 weeks of use. Overall okay but not an amazing product. I was a little disappointed---I expected more from Olay. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great Moisturizer This product is lightly scented and goes on smooth. It makes my skin feel extremely soft and smooth. No matter how much you use it does not feel greasy and it absorbs well. I use this every morning and it keeps my skin looking great.
"Olay total effects 7-in-1 moisturizer I have been using olay total effects for about a week now. This product has some pros and cons. I like that it keeps my skin soft (especially in this dry-prone skin weather), without looking or feeling greasy or oily. You're skin is completely hydrated. It also helped with the appearance of dark marks under the eyes an overall brightened my skintone. I didn't notice much difference with the appearance of pores or fine lines around my mouth but perhaps with continued use further results will be noticed. Overall I give this product 3.5/5 and it is definitely worth a try if you have dark marks and dry skin but dislike oily-feeling facial moisturizers.

"Olay Totally Softer! At first, I wasn't that excited to reciebe my Olay Total Effexts moisturizer because I don't normally wear moisturizer as it causes me to feel oily and break out. But, I tried it right away and it made my skin feel so soft!! I'm not a huge fan of the scent, it smells old lady to me! Something fresher would be more appealing. I also found that it did smooth out my skin tone a tiny bit, and my skin felt smoother for sure! I don't have a lot of wrinkles to begin with, but it did give me a healthy glow! All in all, I liked how it made my skin feel, but I can't positively say it improved all the 7 signs of aging for me in just 4 weeks! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So far so good I have been using this product for a couple weeks so far and I'm not sure if I've noticed a huge difference. I have had a couple people ask me what I've been doing different but when I ask what they notice they touched don't touch on anything this product 'is suppose to do'. There is a fragrance sent to the product and this I am not very fond of. I find this product to be a little thick but it's not horrible. It doesn't make my skin oily so this is a big plus! The price is great as well. One of ,y favorite things about it is that it moisturizers the skin very very well. I am going to continue to use this for a another few weeks so I can give another review to see if more changes are present This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice texture and feels smooth on skin. After receiving the sample for Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer this review is based on 4 uses. I like the texture of the cream it's not too thick or too running and applies well. The scent could be a little lighter but is only noticeable when the moisturizer is applied to the nose area. I like that it is oil free and doesn't give a shine to my face and it blends well with my cc cream. The vitamins that are in this moisturizer (C,E) and VitaNiacin complex are bonuses and it's good to know that I am putting vitamins into my skin. However, many creams that have skin exfoliation make my skin rub off into the cream leaving my face with pieces of dead skin that I have to brush off. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer does this as well but to a minimal degree. I like it more than the Olay regenerist Luminous tone perfecting cream. For this reason I will use this when I am not in a hurry. Also, I like that it doesn't burn my skin or give a redness or tingle. The pump bottle is good too I prefer it over a tube but the lid is very hard to open. (The full size bottle may not have this problem). The anti aging properties cannot be reviewed at this time as it takes at least a month or more to evaluate however, based on the findings above I will give it a try.

"Olay Total Effects I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a fabulous moisturizer. It is light to apply and not greasy. I generally refrain from using moisturizers because they tend to be too heavy and greasy and always cause my face to break out- which OLAY total effects never did!!. I love that there is a slight fragrance but it's not over powering which is a must in my books. As far as visibly smoothing fine lines and wrinkles- I can't say I have enough predominant lines and wrinkles to even notice a difference. I don't have uneven skin tone, so I can't vouch for that either. As far as enhancing brightness- I might notice a small difference- but mainly around the time of application, which is at bed time for me. I will say though I did notice a change in the appearance of my pours beside my nose! The only time I fee as though my skin is firmer is for about 20 minutes initially after applying the cream- and only around my eyes. I would be very interested to see what it does for my skin for a lengthy period of time using it. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a moisturizer that is light and not oily. For someone of my age- you won't notice much anti aging - but isn't using it assisting in anti-aging! gotitfree OlayTotalEffects7in1AntiAgingMoisturizer bzz bzzagent This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not noticing a difference from other moisturizers I've been using Olay Total Effects Moisturizer for a while now (admittedly not everyday) and I'm not really noticing much of a difference from any other moisturizer I have used (again, not on a regular basis). I expected to see less dark circles/bags under my eyes since this moisturizer is meant to fight the signs of gaining and since you are supposed to look younger from using it. Of course, it doesn't mention bags or circles under your eyes so maybe I was mistaken or need to use a specific cream. I'm not sure. It's not like I completely hated the product - it did feel silky when applied and smelled quite nice - but if I'm going to pay money for a product, I want one that focuses on my specific area of improve to which would be under the eye.

"Wonderful everyday moisturizer for aging skin The first thing you notice when putting on this moisturizer is the fantastic scent! Very feminine, a little perfume-y, but still a delight to apply. The second is that it feels a little heavy, but after a few moments it absorbs completely into your skin. I like this as a night time moisturizer, as it feels there is a lot of substance to the product, but I still don't have to grease up my pillow when I go to bed. The effects you can FEEL when you touch your skin - tighter and smoother, and lasts well into the 12+ hour mark. I found it brightened my face noticeably the most, then reduced fine lines and wrinkles a close second. All in all, a decent everyday anti-aging moisturizer.

"It's a decent moisturizer I am really starting to look at anti-aging products over the last couple of years as I'm in my late 30's and am starting to notice small wrinkles in places. I also have a tendency to get a bit of dry skin during the winter months so I was looking forward to trying a new anti-aging moisturizer. The scent was pleasant and not to strong or over bearing. The cream is light weight and went on nice and didn't leave my skin feeling greasy or oily. I have been using it daily since I received the sample and unfortunately , I am not able to testify to any of the anti-aging benefits this moisturizer claims to do. I haven't really noticed an improvement in my skin and I still have a bit of dry skin. I have no problems with it as a product, I just haven't found that it stood out from any of the moisturizers I've used in the bit of time I've been using it. As a result, I will probably stick to my regular moisturizers and not spend the extra money on this product. I would still recommend to others to give it a shot and see how it works out for them, especially if they have different skin types than I do. Also, if people are experiencing more aging with their skin in terms of wrinkles, etc, then they may notice greater benefits with this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My face feels restored! After BzzAgent sent me a sample size of the new Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I was excited to try this product for the first time. I don't regularly use Olay brand products, I really wanted to know if it would work the way that it's advertised, so I was eager to try it out. I found that it really did deliver on its promises! The unique blend of vitamins really seems to replenish my skin, fill-in fine lines and even my skin tone. My only concern for this product is that it feels a little 'heavier' than I'd like. It feels a little like putting on sunscreen than putting on a facial moisturizer ... other than that, I love it! Thanks Olay. Thanks BzzAgent. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Anti-Aging Moisturizer I've almost almost completely used up the sample that was sent to me. I used it as a night cream because I find it to be too oily as a day cream. First impressions were good, packaging is nice and I like the built in pump, which released a good amount of product. I have some dryness and flakiness right now because of the dry winter, so this moisturizer wasn't quite enough to help me with that issue. It worked well as a regular daily moisturizer, but I didn't see any dramatic effects to my skin (i.e. smoothing). The texture of the cream is nice, smooth, not greasy and fairly light, but difficult to wear under makeup. It didn't create any sensitivity in my skin, which was good. I think it's a decent product as a regular moisturizer but I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because I didn't notice too many anti-aging properties. I also think I would need to have 2 moisturizers, one for day and this one for night, if I did continue to use it. I used the product in my daily night routine, which involves toner or serum, moisturizer, eye cream, lip treatment and rose balm for my very dry spots. I don't think I will continue to use it because I have other creams that I prefer for the texture and properties, but I think this would be a good backup choice.

"Miracle product!!! I have been using Regenerist Deep Hydration Cream for the past 10 years. I am 83 and people think I am in my 60s. I have always used products to protect and moisturize my skin, and I have found that this is the best.. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer Review Pros: Non-Greasy, minimizes the appearance of fine lines and pores, glides on nicely Cons: Maybe, possibly the scent. It's subtle, but (for me) the scent it does have seems 'chemically' In a Nutshell: Olay says This formula with its VitaNiacin Complex fights the 7 signs of aging with vitamin B3. This product claims to: Minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles Moisturize to soothe and nourish dry skin Balance colour and tone while reducing the appearance of age spots My Experience This vitamin-enriched cream glides on easily and absorbs nicely into the skin without leaving a sticky residue or feeling too heavy. I really like the pump action no fingers in a jar, and a little goes a long way. My skin does appear to have a healthier glow and my skin tone seems balanced out although, I think that's due to the brightening effect, which is likely some sort of pigment in the cream, causing a trick of the light effect. So....not as spectacular as it seems. The unique vitamin formula contains vitamins B and E, which help nourish the skin, minimize pores, and diminish fine lines. I can't say that it's taken 10 years off my skin, but I'm pleased with what I do see and feel. This is a quality drugstore product. Recommended: Yes This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects...not my favourite I was hesitant to try Olay Total Effects as I love my current moisturizer and was worried what a different product would do to my skin. As someone with plenty of laugh lines to go around, I decided to throw caution to the wind and give it a shot. The pump bottle is great fragrance is pleasant and not at all over powering. The moisturizer was light and did not feel greasy at all. For the first week or so, all was well. Unfortunately, I started developing acne and finally gave up on the product after the third week when new spots kept appearing. This product seems quite lovely for most, however, I would caution those who have sensitive or acne prone skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 I think that this is a good moisturizer but was disappointed in some of its claims - I do not find my skin to be brighter or firmer - although I don't truly consider these to be problem areas of mine. I was more interested in the idea that it would even skin tone and the reduction of age spots. I don't find that it addressed either of these concerns for me. There - after roughly two weeks - is no change for me. Is it a good moisturizer - yes absolutely - skin is soft to the touch, not a lot of residue left behind, and no dullness. But I don't personally find that it meets all of its claims. So depending on what you are looking for , this is my personal opinion and experience and may not be reflected by other users.

"like it but don't love it.. I think the key to this product actually working for me is to put more on my face than as directed. When I put more, it lathers better into my skin and my face feels moisturized. When I don't put enough, my skin feels a little dry and brittle. I don't normally have dry skin though, its a combination of oily to dry in some areas around the nose and forehead. I'm not sure after this campaign if I will buy a bottle because my results were not in the 'wow' department... I definitely don't look any younger, haha. I guess its all part of marketing.. I know people who've been using this product for years and their skin looks young and fresh and amazing so maybe its something that needs more time to adjust to your skin...

"Hmmm..lets think :) Okay I love this product!! Okay, it does not only have to be used as a magic potion(to make us all look younger)it can also be used as a an average make up product and it could be like a first makeup layer. Here are some other things it does :) -Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles,Makes me look a little bit younger but not that much! -Evens skin tone appearance,yup it really does :) -Enhances brightnessIt adds just that pop that most up girls like -Replenishes moisture-my face was moisterized like the whole day! In general I would rate this a 3-5 because its effective,don't get me wrong,but its not as effective as I hoped it would be :( I still look a little old and I still feel old :( This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So far so good! I'm not one to regularly use moisterizer, as I have combination skin and have found it usually makes my face feel greasy. I haven't used Olay before so I was excited to give it a whirl. I had been waiting anxiously for my free trial of Olay Total Effects 7in 1 moisturizer and was pumped when in finally came in! I wasn't fond of the scent, it smells kind of old ladyish to me. But it went on smooth and left my skin feeling soft. So, all I can say is so far so good! I plan to keep using it to see if it really does all the things it says, such as reduce lines, even skin tone and reduce age spots to name a few. Also, will be looking to see if it causes me to break out as too any moisturizers do. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good all-around moisturizer I've used the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about a week and it definitely fulfills some of its promises. I've found it to helped my skin to: Enhances brightness Minimizes the look of pores Replenishes moisture I've found it to make my skin smoother and moisturized, especially since it's been chapped from the winter weather. Due to the oily nature of my skin, I found that it was a little too moisturizing for my preference but other than that, I would highly recommend it as an all around quality moisturizer. I intend to pass on my sample to my 85 year-old grandmother to try and get her input on the product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Rich moisturizer, maybe too rich My skin was just starting to flake from the winter dryness when I received this sample. No other moisturizer I have used has been able to stop my skin from flaking once it starts, but this one did. It also did it without the typical burning sensation some other moisturizers can have. It did appear to even out my skin tone at the same time and a little goes a long ways. However, even with my super dry skin I would not recommend it as a daily use moisturizer. I have combination skin and while this works great on my cheeks it seems like it is too rich and aggravates the acne on forehead and chin. In a nutshell: great for getting past any super dry spells but too rich for everyday use on combo skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Very thick and maybe not made for sensitive, combination skin. I think the product works better than many products I have tried, but for someone who may have sensitive combination skin, this product left my skin breaking out due to the thickness of it. I could see how it would work for people who would be able to use this on a daily basis, but for me, my skin is just too sensitive to continue using it. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer had a nice mild sent to it and the unique vitamin complex felt great as it hydrated my dry skin from this cold winter, but it bother my eyes and skin. I will have to stick with my hypo-allergenic moisturizer that is made specifically for sensitive skin. Thank you BuzzAgent for letting me try it out though.

"Nice, Light Scent but unsure whether it gave me 7 benefits Once I received the 15ml sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I was really excited to give it a go. I haven't been very nice to my skin recently and the harsh winter is showing up in lines and dryness. I was pleasantly surprised by the light scent of the product. So many times cosmetics tend to be overly strong and artificial smelling. Harsh scents are a giveaway my skin will say NOOOOO! I liked the small trial size (15ml) as it's a perfect size to slip in your purse in case you are having a shiny day and need a touch up. I found that the product definitely moisturized my face and left my skin smooth. I also appreciated the variety of shades they offer and felt like all nationalities of customers would be able to achieve that perfect, blended look. Did I find the product reduced the lines on my face Not really, but it did even out my skin tone and it did make my skin less dry and winter stricken. I'm not sure that this will become a staple in my cosmetics, but I did enjoy the trial period and my skin appreciated the extra attention. I think that the trial size would be something I may purchase again in the future but I see myself enjoying it more on an occasional basis and not everyday.

You Want your wrinkles to vanish This product works wonders on wrinkles! It is better than any wrinkle product that i have tried and i have tried them all from top dollar to snake oil. Olay Regenerist is the absolute best product on the market today. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"It does the job At first opening I loved the product - neat format - easy to use pump and the smell was strong and pleasant , typical of Olay. They do not shy away from fragrance, and I like that. I have used the product repeatedly now and I love the way it goes on, smooth and instantaneously feels like my skin is getting re hydrated but sometimes when I put it on there is a tingling on my face that is not pleasant. I want a moisturizer to go on and you feel like you have not put it on. My face is not left greasy which is a bonus. I do not feel that it has minimized the look of my pores but after putting it on I would say the face feels firmer. Overall I like this product but I am not in love with this product.

"fountain of youth I'm nearing an age where an anti aging moisturizer will soon be necessary and have been on the lookout for a decent product for some time now. I received the Olay total effects moisturizer in the mail and started using it right away. First of all, it smelled great and went on smoothly and evenly. It didn't dry out my skin or make it oily. Unfortunately, my combination skin didn't react well to a new product and I ended up breaking out so badly that I had to stop using it after 3 weeks. This made it difficult to properly review it. I would say that if you have an average skin type without any sensitivities, it's worth a try only because of the quality of the cream and the ease at which it went on.

Olay total effects So i didnt want to try any review on this until i have been using it for a while.. So im going to list the pros. 1: dispenses perfect amount in one pump 2: smells great and not overpowering 3: didnt make my skin greasy or create any negative reactions That being said i didnt notice any changes in my skin other than maybe it was less greasy than it normally had been but i am also pregnant and cannot contribute that solely on this product. I didnt see reduced signs of wrinkles/crows feet at all sadly.. Which is what i was hopeful for.. But not everything can be miricle working. I love Olay as a product i swear by their body wash.. But i have to say this product didn't meet the same expectations This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"SENSITIVE SKIN AN ISSUE I received the Olay moisturizer and was hesitant in trying it as I have extremely sensitive skin. I applied it in the evening only as I didn't want to chance having a double whammy if I did have a reaction. The smell of the product is very light (almost not noticeable). The texture is smooth and it absorbs quickly and isn't in any way greasy or shiny. After three days (evenings) of using the moisturizer, I did have a reaction. Redness definitely, uneven blotchy skin - totally normal for me if I attempt to try anything other than my normal moisturizer. I'm giving the productd a 3/5 as I can't blame for product for my sensitivity issues. Also, due to only using it for a three day trial, that definitely isn't enough time to give it a negative review. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Right in line with regular Olay products Well, I've used this cream as it describes on the bottle and while I appreciate a sample size I just don't see any difference. I've used it daily as written on the bottle and after ten days I've almost run out the product. I love the thick cream and how easy a small amount covers my face. If this were just a daily use lotion it would be perfect. I can't really comment on the effectiveness it claims because it says in as little as four weeks I've hit ten days and have seen no change. I love the fragrance free and texture in this cream. I will note my face did seem a bit drier everyday but that could be attributed to the change in weather where I live. Overall, as a regular lotion I would buy this product. If I were looking for an anti-aging product I simply did not have enough product to judge results.

"Average Anti Aging Cream I have used the product for over a week now, and I was pleasantly surprised. I always associate anti aging creams with a very thick texture. It was not too oily, and smooth. It had a faint pleasant smell, not too strong at all. Now in regards to the claims: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles Evens skin tone appearance Enhances brightness Minimizes the look of pores Visibly reduces age spots Restores firmness Replenishes moisture I did not notice any improvement in fine lines. It did not appear to even skin tone, as I have some acne scars. It did however minimize the look of pores. My skin did feel and seem noticibly smoother, moistured, and firmer. I can't commend on its effect on age spots, as I do not have any. I find it pleasant as a cream, but not different from other products I have tried. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Hard to tell It took me longer to rate this product as the size was so small and I could not notice any significant difference in my skin for the week as I normally just use coconut oil . The only claim that I can see from using this product is that it replenishes moisture I think I will need to use this product longer to see better results. It was also hard to Bzz as we didnt have any incentive that we usually get to spread the word - For example, if we had coupons to give out- it will be a natural way to start talking about how great a product is or the difference I see after using a product. I am always sincere with what I recommend and that is why my friends trust me and will buy a product based on my recommendation. Unfortunately, I could not see enough of a difference for me to talk about this product . This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not Sure Yet Ugh! I am so on the fence about this moisturizer! One the one hand, I know the Olay brand has been around a long time and you don't stick around if you have bad products! The quality of the moisturizer is good with regards to texture and consistency, but the fragrance is putting me off and the fact that it stung my skin when I used it after I washed my face. I tried it again another day at night, a few hours after I washed and it was okay. The problem I have, is that I like to put my moisturizer on right after my shower as I have dry skin and I find it works better for me that way. I am torn if I should try the fragrance free version. (I WISH that had been an option we were given) Also, I can't tell if there is something in this moisturizer that gives a nice glow or it is giving me a glow because it's working! Either way, I think under light makeup it would be nice because it does give my pale skin a lovely glow. I also can't tell yet if it is smoothing my fine lines. I don't know about the whole minimize the look of pores thing. I don't any moisturizer could really do that - but I will see how this performs when I use it more. (I have only used it about 3 times so far) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good as primer This worked great as a primer before makeup to smooth pores, etc. I think there's silicones or dimethicone, or some cone in there. Looks great when initially applied. Long-term, I'm not convinced that it's really a quality anti-aging product. Vitamin E and C are good for lightening spots and scars, but the vitamin C products I usually use have some sort of opening that prevents air from entering to avoid oxidization/ if you leave some out in the air for too long, it turns brown. That doesn't seem to be an issue with this product, which leads me to believe that it doesn't have high enough levels to be very effective. Overall it is a decent product though. It has an inoffensive smell, moisturizes, and feels luxurious, like a facial. When I use it, I definitely feel more confident going NoMakeup. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Mild scented, no sticky feel Common problem for women in their thirties is that signs of aging starting to show up in our face. Wrinkles and age spots are my main concern that prompted me to sit down with my tablet and search for products that will help me fight my struggle. I am glad I was chosen to try the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 moisturizer. This gave me the oppurtunity to try the product for free to see if it works for me. I have been using the moisturizer for 2 days now and counting. I like the mild scent and the non sticky feel. I have also felt a mild sting in my nose area after applying it but disappears right away in 2-3 minutes. I am hoping this is the sign that the cream is doing its magic. I'll keep my fingers crossed while Olay Total Effects fights my signs of aging. Will be updating you with the results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Used often and proven results I use this product hours before bed for deep hydration and sometimes the night renewal cream. My skin looks replenished in the morning. I do wake up with slightly oily skin but I wouldn't hold it against the product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay is okay! Product seems to have the same traditional smell it had when I was growing up as a child as I grew up to my grandmother faithfully using all olay products.. I really think this product worked when it came to highlighting your face, kind of like a shiny glow...taking away dark circles and feeling an even skin tone ... It also did refresh and make my face feel more moisturized, and lastly a very even skin tone... The only thing I noticed is after a couple days of not using I felt like my skin tone around my cheeks turned a little red as if I was blushing ... Using product again just to see if results are the same or the weather is affecting my skin ... I normally have fair skin and no issues at all... Will post another review This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Starting to see a difference I received my sample Friday and excitedly opened it anxious to give it a try. I love the cute packaging, the mini version of a full size product was just too cute. On my first pump I was disappointed. There seemed to be an issue using the pump. It took several tries before getting any product to 'spurt' out , which sadly went everywhere. It seemed as if there was more air than product. Not being one to give up, I tried a few more times. The pumping resulted in the same issue....lots of air and a bit of product. As a last resort I cut the top off and put the product into a travel container....my fears were confirmed....the container was less than half full. Since Friday, I have been using it ( sparingly) after my usual morning routine. I love the texture and pleasant , not overpowering sent of the lotion. It goes on smoothly, non greasy, and is absorbed almost immediately. After 4 days I am noticing my skin is looking a lot better, more even tone, the pores on my nose seem a bit smaller, as are the fine lines I have starting around my eyes. Other than the issues with the samples pump and the lack of product therein, I love it. Can't wait to see what the results will be at the end of the sample ) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Maybe I'm Just Too Young! I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks now, and I do not see any noticeable improvement in my skin tone or fine lines. I'm just starting to develop wrinkles and do not have any age spots, so maybe my skin is not at a stage where the product could have much of an impact. I guess that's a good thing! The product itself has a pleasant scent, but it's a little strong when you first apply it. It's texture is smooth, and even though it's tinted, it blends in nicely with my skin tone. I normally use a tinted moisturizer with sunscreen, and I have found the Olay Total Effects product to be not as effective in moisturizing. All in all, it's a product that I was not impressed with...yet. When I get older, my skin might be begging for it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"too soon to see results So I've been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer for about one month. I must say that I really love the light scent and consistency of the face cream. It is not too thick and not too thin. You only need to use a little for your whole face. However, I have not noticed any difference in fine line and age spots. I still see the wrinkles and age spots that I had before. But my face feels quite smooth but honestly, I never really had problems with uneven skin. I have yet to find a product that dramatically reduces wrinkle and age spots. Overall, I think it is a good face cream that will moisturize your skin but I'm not sure of the anti-aging qualities. Please note that I have only used it for about one month- it may take longer for the results to show. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effects I'm on the fence with this one. I dont hate it but I dont love it. I like the silky feel the lotion has and that it is fragrance free. Also having the sunscreen in it is a plus. Im just not sure if it is actually making a difference in the appearance of my skin. I dont have a ton of wrinkles but I do have some and im sure more to come haha! But I just dont see a big change in the ones I have. I have always liked the Olay brand and their products, maybe this one just isnt for me. As just a mosturizing lotion I think its great. Silky feeling and wasnt sticky also dried fast. Because im putting it on before bed I am happy it is fragrance free as im not big on scents while sleeping. Overall I feel it is a good lotion, but for anti aging im not sure its doing much for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The pros and cons I was really excited to try the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I found that I liked the product when I started using it. It had: - great scent - smooth texture - felt nice after application However, in my case I also found some negatives. One minor thing that I did not like was the product still felt more oily than I prefer for a face cream. The other negative is that I found my eyes watering and stinging within about a minute of using the product. I tried using it twice but both times I had the same problem...and no I did not apply it close to my eyes. I was very careful how I apply it. Because of this I did not continue using this product. Overall, I think the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer may be great for many but because of the possible effect I would say that one should be careful if you have sensitivities.

"Moisturizing Olay Total Effects 7 I have been trying Oil of Olay Total Effects 7 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It is a good moisturizer cream and does not go on greasy. I found that it is not enough moisture if in the winter if you have real dry skin. Great when you need a light moisture cream. It makes your skin feel soft. It will smooth fine lines and wrinkles but cannot say if it is working because I don't have these skin issues. It does even out your skin tone and brighten your skins appearance. It will minimize the look of pores and reduce age spots, I have only used it for a couple days and have not noticed these benefits yet. It does state on the box that it takes 4 weeks for skin natural self renewal process for healthier looking skin. I will continue to use this product and see if I notice the benefits after a week or more continual use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I would like to thank BzzAgent for giving me the opportunity to try the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I have used the moisturizer for four weeks now. I haven't found that it is any different than any other moisturizer out there. It has not reduced my age spots - perhaps if I used it for longer it might. One of the problems that I have always had with using moisturizers is getting pimples. Unfortunately I developed pimples while using the moisturizer. I have not received any comments from fellow employees that my face looks any different. I did like that it was fast absorbing and did not leave a greasy film on my face. The pump on the container is an excellent feature. I will continue to use the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer until the sample is done to see if it will reduce my age spots, and report back.

"Works well I received my trial sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and have been using this product for several weeks now. I do love how my skin feels. I can also tell that my pores are less visible now. I'm a huge fan of tinted moisturizers that help to even my skin tone and this product does not fail to deliver on this claim. My skin tone is noticeably more balanced. I would definitely consider making this product with the sunscreen my everyday moisturizer, but unfortunately I can't justify switching from the product that I have been using that does the same for a less expensive price. If Oil of Olay products were more affordable, I wouldn't hesitate to make the change. If budget is not an issue, I certainly recommend Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer.

"good quality for the price I tried Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I receive the trial in the perfect season to test it to the limit. in winter my skin tend to get very dry, so dry that sometimes it flakes on my nose but not this winter! I used it twice a day and it kept my skin smooth an well hydatated. it is really easy to apply not to thick and it get absorbed really fast by skin so no greasy feeling after application. I also have a sensitive type of skin so the product is also available in fragrance-free. as for it's anti-aging proprieties I did not see any results but I imagine since most anti-aging cream are working in prevention this one will also gives results over times to helps prevent sign s of aging . for its price it is really good quality...you don't lose much to give it a try This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Olay makes my skin so soft! I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks now. I love the how it is making my skin incredibly soft. I live in very cold weather and find that my skin gets incredibly dry. My skin is extremely soft right now, and I am very pleased. Unfortunately it has not helped my age spot on my face. I have two. They have not changed in appearance or size at all. I was a little disappointed as this is one of the benefits listed for the product. My fine lines don't look a lot different but my skin has a very fresh dewy sort of look to it, sop overall I am pleased with the product. I would buy the product just for how well it moisturizes and for the fresh look my skin has taken. I am not sure I would recommend it only of the e gaining properties alone though.

"after 3 weeks of use My skin: If you have read my previous post I have oily yet dry, acne prone sensitive skin with hyperpigmentation from acne scaring. I however, do not have any wrinkles quite yet. I also use topical acne products (hence why my skin gets so dry). It is also cold dry winter which makes my skin even more dry. As a moisturizer: good as a moisturizer. My skin wasn't flaky or peeling and it did not feel tight. As an SPF: this is a good baseline SPF but if you spend many hours in the sunlight or if you use acne products that make your skin more sensitive and more likely to burn, you will not be able to use JUST this. I personally have to use an SPF 45 after using this to prevent burns on my face throughout the day. As a hyperpigmentation corrector: I saw no improvement. I only used it for 3 weeks so I'm not sure if I keep using it, if that will help. I'm going to try for 6 weeks. As an anti wrinkle product: I had no wrinkles going into the campaign however, I am always actively searching for ways to prevent wrinkles in the future. (so this makes it a bit hard to judge how well the product works as an anti-aging product). I am happy to say I didn't develop any wrinkles during the campaign!

"Great product for normal to oily skin. My mom always used Olay products so using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer made me feel really grown up. I used it in place of my regular moisturizer for a week and a half to test it out. First of all, I love the texture. It comes out like a mousse and it just melts into my face. I could just put this on all day. I do have dry skin to begin with, but after a few days I noticed it was even dryer than normal even though I applied it twice a day. I also noticed I was getting more blackheads on my nose but that went away after a few days. I didn't really noticed any improvement in the 7 signs of aging. My fine lines look about the same, my pores are bigger around the nose (see the attached picture), and my skin is dryer and rougher than with my standard moisturizer (it looks shiny in the picture but that's just the flash - it's VERY dry to the touch). I think Olay makes good products and my mom swears by them, but her skin is combination/oily. I wouldn't recommend this product for people like me with very dry skin but if they come out with a dry skin formula and the same mousse-y texture, I will be the first in line to buy it.

Started off great then OUTBREAK!! I recently received in the mail a trial size (15 ml) of Olay's Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer to try from BzzAgent and OLAY. I loved it at first as it made my skin bright I would apply the moisturizer once before bed and again in the morning. However after a week of usage I had a very severe reaction. my entire face broke out into hives right before Christmas and I had an acne outbreak like no other. I had roughly 4 pimples on each cheek it was absolutely disheartening but now I know the sensitivity of my skin. I wouldn't go as far as to say that this product does not work or it lets you break out. But just be sure to test it on a part of your skin before using it on your whole face. In all honesty I experienced the brightness that the crme provided my skin. But the end results of it all was not worth it for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Second opinion Now that I have been using this product for longer I have a more accurate opinion of it. I really like how fresh my face feels afterwards! My skin is much more hydrated since beginning with this lotion! I have also noticed a more even skin tone overall which is great! I have still not noticed a difference in the fine line around my eyes though. I feel like this product does not fully live up to it's claim of 7 in 1 anti aging effects. I would give it maybe a 3 or 4 in 1 label instead of 7. Overall I like this lotion as a general moisturizer but not much past that, and I feel as if I can get the same effects from any other facial moisturizer. I would maybe buy the trial size once it becomes available in stores but I do not think I would buy the full size version of this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Pleasant fragrance, smooth silky texture I received a trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer and was eager to try it as I have used Olay products for years. I am nearing 40 and have tried many products. I stick to a few that I prefer and Olay is one of them. When I first used this product I noticed an issue right away with the pump. I tried to go as slow as possible but no matter what I did the product would shoot out of the pump and go flying. I wanted to try the product though so I figured out a way to get it to land on my hand then I could apply it. I first noticed the smooth and silky texture which I absolutely loved. Applying it was a breeze and wasn't sticky or oily and had a very pleasant fragrance, not too strong. I was really impressed with the texture and how silky it felt. It dried fast but left my skin very silky and soft. Since this was a trial size I was unable to see any major results as I would have needed more product to use over a longer time frame. I would, however, use this product again if the pump would cooperate! I love the smell, texture, and how it feels on my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"It's ok but not Fantastic I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for just over 4 weeks now. I enjoy how tOlay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer contains Vitamins B3, B5 and E. The scent is not that bad and does not last that long, but at first it is a bit strong at first. I found that when i first applied the lotion to my face it had a burning feeling. After a few days of use this sensation went away but it did concern me at first as I do have sensitive skin. I do find that it helps even my skin tone and replenishes moisture in my skin but I do not notice a big difference with the fine lines and wrinkles. My skin does not feel any different when it comes to firmness and or the look of my pores. I do not have age spots so I am not sure how this area works. All in all this product is ok, but I would not personally purchase it as it does not complete all the tasks it claims to, as well it is not great for sensitive skin at first and I am not a fan of the scent. A few positive things of the product in summary is that it moisturizes all day and has multiple vitamins. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great product, but not for everyone I think this is a great product. I did like how smooth the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer felt going onto my skin, but unfortunately it wasn't right for my sensitive skin. Within seconds of putting it on, I felt a slight burning on my face. It was relatively minor, so I did continue to use it so that I could see the differences it can offer for me. Here's my experience with this product: PROS: - I did find it helped smooth the fine lines on my face, which is great! - Lasting moisture for the entire day. - Slight improvement in skin tone. - Helped minimize pores slightly. CONS: - A bit too harsh for my sensitive skin, leaving me with a slight burning sensation after application. - Noticed increased shine on my face mid-day, which I didn't like. - Did not notice a difference in lift for my skin. - Not enough changes in skin tone or pore visibility for me to continue use.

"A nice, light moisturizer but I'm not noticing any miracles yet... This is a nice, light every day moisturizer with pros and cons. First off, I really liked the metered dosage of the pump in the sample. Hopefully that's the same with the full sized bottle because I felt that it was just the right amount to cover my whole face. Secondly, the fragrance is what hit me next. It has a light fragrance that isn't too strong so it's not overwhelming when I put it on my face. The colour was pleasant and not too bold or strong and so it matched the scent well. The moisturizer itself is thick in texture but not thick at all on the face. It works great under makeup and isn't greasy at all. I was able to follow up the application of this cream with my daily makeup routine right away with no problems. Not sticky and tacky and doesn't roll or crumble off like other moisturizers. As for the bold claims this product makes, I haven't noticed anything different yet. No reduction in fine lines and wrinkles and no difference in my skin tone. Also, it's not quite moisturizing enough for the dryness of my skin. That being said, for a light, every day moisturizer, it's not the worst one I've ever tried, it's just probably not going to make my wrinkles disappear. Or at least it hasn't yet :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Trial Day 2 of olay age reducer 1. When It comes to Visibly smoothing fine lines and wrinkles haven't seen any effect after 2 days. 2. As far as Making skin tone even inappearance or Enhancing brightness still no improvement after 2 days. 3. But I can tell You that rather then Minimising the look of pores it actually is maximizing it after only 2 days !!! 4. No change in age spots or worse can't tell Really yet. And I have a few !! 5. No Change in firmness nor moisture yet Down side. It's a bit too rich and oily ( personnaly finding it too oily and sticky immediately after usage. It does get better after a couple of hours ) Bright side. The smell Is not overwhelming which is a plus for me Because of allergy and one little pump goes a long way becAuse it Spreads easily so I have a feeling That small bottle Will Last me up for a while. Will See... This review was collected as part of a promotion.
What I have been waiting for My mom always used Olay when I was growing up and like a typical teen I didn't listen. As I grew older I began to see my error. I could not be happier with the results I have achieved. My friends say I look ten years younger. Always listen to your mother This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Still enjoying the moisture but waiting to see anti wrinkle effects I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for several weeks now. It has a nice fresh, fragrance and smooth, luxurious texture. So far I am not seeing any outrageous wrinkle reduction but my face and neck skin is staying moisturized while in an extremely cold climate here. That is not an easy task.

"The Jury Is Still Out! I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about 3 weeks now and to be honest I have not really noticed a big change in my skin. Wha I can tell you is I really dislike the smell, it is really not a very appealing smell and kind of sticks with you because it is all over your face and right under your nose. What I do like is the consistency of the moisturizer, it is very light and almost fluffy feeling, it goes on nice and smooth and absorbs well. I will say that I have seen noticeable difference in the hydration of my skin, it is not tight and my foundation looks freshly applied throughout the day. I will definitely continue to use this product for another couple weeks to see if I am witness to any further results of this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A good multi-purpose cream I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for several days now. What I like about it is that it is very light and absorbs quickly without feeling like you have a cream on at all. I apply it in the mornings and wear it under a liquid foundation and I find that it is an adequate base that does not effect my makeup or the length of wear. I did find that it had a very light but pleasant scent that dissipated with absorption. Although I look for help with anti-aging , I also have acne prone skin. I maintained my regular nightly skincare routine, and I did not find that adding this moisturizer in the morning caused an acne flair up of any kind. On the Anti-aging side, I feel that it did somewhat brighten and even the tone of my skin, but I did not find that it did much for dark circles under my eyes and fine lines and wrinkles around my mouth and eyes. I would recommend this as a good daily moisturizer, or even as a moisturizing base under makeup, as I did like the feel of my skin after applying. However, I would not recommend if you are looking for fast or dramatic anti-aging effects. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Short term yes, long term no Well I wanted to add before and after pictures, but the before actually looked better! But that could be focus, lighting, etc. I don't believe this necessarily made my skin worse... but I did stop using my regular/ favourite products for a few weeks in order to properly test this out. For anti aging, dark spots, and acne I usually use (pretty inexpensive i.e. Garnier, Neutrogena, Roc) retinol creams, vitamin C serum and recently, turmeric cream. Can't wait to go back to my retinol!! It's the only think that I believe really works none to be found in Olay total effects. But it doesn't claim to have it. On the positive side, this product had just the right amount of moisture for my oily/ combination skin and worked as an excellent primer to wear under makeup. Really good immediate results, not so great long-term results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice, but not for me! In my early forties, I'm beginning to notice more wrinkles for sure. More recently, my face has sported some brown age spots that I tolerate, but that I'm not to happy about! Thus, I was happy to try Olay Total Effects, particularly when I read that one of its seven ant-aging benefits was to visibly reduce age spots. The bottle was cute and the scent light, not cloying (I dislike overly scented products). The creme itself seemed on the think side, and it didn't take much to smooth on my face. My skin felt moisturized and silky, though a little sticky because the creme is so thick. A pretty good start! However, my major problem with Olay Total Effects was that after two more days of using it, my skin got a big itchy, perhaps a mild allergic reaction, especially around my jaw line, so unfortunately I had to stop using it. I can't give a full review of how it might have improved my skin after three or four weeks, but I can say that for those who don't have a reaction like me, Olay Total Effects certainly is worth trying, because Olay is such a well-respected brand and the creme was quite luxurious! Happy anti-aging! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Some positives, but just not the right moisturizer for me. I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer for almost eight weeks now, and I have mixed feelings about the product. First off, I am in my late thirties with combination oily/dry skin. Over the past weeks, I have noticed that my skin is brighter and does have an more even appearance - a definite plus for all those holiday parties! The moisturizer does go on smooth, however, it is a lot heavier than I am use to. It does not feel like it fully absorbs into my skin, and I am left with a slight filmy feeling. I have not noticed any real difference to my fine lines across my forehead. The product packaging is very nice. The pump is very sturdy and distributes just the right amount of the moisturizer. The moisturizer has a faint but very pleasant scent, which is not over-powering. There are quite a few positives about this product, however, for my skin, and for what I am use to, it is a bit too heavy. Thanks Olay and BzzAgent for the opportunity to try out this new product, and I hope others will find my review helpful. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"MY EXPERIENCE WITH OLAY TOTAL Well I first have to say that I didn't want to report until I used most of my sample of Olay Total. I used it faithful everyday. The first time I used it I like the soft fragrance of Olay Total, it was light but found it a little bit grease rubbing in. I decided to but in on every night after I washed my face for the night. The first time I used it my skin felt very soft. As I started to use it every night I thought it was firming my skin a little but by the third day I started to break out, no this is nothing on the product Olay Total, it is my skin and it happens offen, my skin is sentive . So I wanted to befair so I kept using it on my clean skin every night. At the end of my seven days I did find my skin some what firmer, and I do think it made my skin brighter and looked nice with my make on. I just wished I didn't break out but like I said it just happens to my skin. I would recommend Olay Total . This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not bad! Not great though, either. First of all, I am a HUGE fan of Olay products. My grandma + mother have used Olay for as long as I can remember. I really have never used another brand...and my skin shows it! I had been using the same Olay cleansing routine since I was in my teens, and it was time for a change. I started using this moisturizer a few months ago, along with a total effects cleanser. I don't know what went wrong. Maybe the Olay for you lady swapped my profile with someone else's...because this just wasn't for me. I didn't notice any line minimization, lifting, pore refinement, or visibly younger-looking skin...which were all selling points for me. I also thought the moisturizing was a little over the top. It even left my skin feeling slimy until I cut back from using it daily, to using it every other day. Once I did that, I was very satisfied...but seeing as I'm not overly enthused about this cream as a whole, I wont be buying it again."
"Surprisingly ... Not Bad ! I was a little apprehensive on trying this product as my skin doesn't always react well to new creams. My skin looked really great! My complexion was a more even tone, I didn't have as much redness and for some weird reason, by adult zits were less noticeable. I did not see any change in my fine lines, which I am getting a few. I used this product for about 3 weeks and was deliberately holding off on submitting my review so I could see how my skin reacted once I returned to using my old product. The redness in my skin has returned and I have a few more pimples than before while using Olay. I was most shocked at how nicely this cream absorbed into my skin. I had no greasy feeling like with my old product - as soon as I started back with the old stuff, the greasiness returned. I don't think I would continue to use Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer in the future because it didn't perform quite well enough. This product isn't exactly cheap, though more reasonable than others, but I think I would invest in a product which does meet all of my expectations and needs.

"Im not quite sure how I feel yet After using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for almost two weeks, I can honestly say, I havent seen much of an improvement. It has a heavy scent to it when you first apply it that I didnt care for, but this scent does go away quite fast, so I was happy about that. You only need one pump to get enough out of the bottle to have enough to cover your whole face and neck, witch I also liked. It blends in very fast witch is another great thing about it. Others Ive tried were the exact opposite and theyd feel like I was there forever trying to blend them in. So I really like this about the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I have found that my facial skin and neck do feel softer to the touch witch is nice, but I just havent seen any improvement in the deeper lines I have developing around my mouth area, or the fine lines that are closer to my eyes. To be fare it does say it takes four weeks and I havent been using it for near that long yet, so I will continue with it and see where I am at the end of the four weeks and report back to you.

"Leaves your skin feeling awesome. I love this product, I spend as much time as I can outside and have fairly dry skin, this product makes my skin feel moisturized without feeling oily.

"One week into the trial I'm one week into trying Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and I'm on the fence as to whether I will continue to use the moisturizer after the trial. I'm looking for visible anti-aging results and so far, the only results I've seen is a break out of acne. I've been using my trial sample every morning after cleansing my face. I do feel like my skin is being moisturized, although it does become shiny after a few hours, which is sooner than usual for me. My skin also feels smoother, with the exception of this break out. To be fair, I'm not entirely sure if my break out is actually connected to the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer or if it's just a coincidence. It could be connected to hormones, so I'm not giving up on the trial. My skin is almost cleared up again, and I am looking forward to seeing how the next 3 weeks are on this trial and if I can see more of the promised results - such as fine line reduction and more refined pores.

"Olay 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I've been using Olay 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a bit now and to be 100 I don't see much of a difference. Not sure if it was because I used too much, (the bottle is now empty) or what bit my lines are still the same. I will say I may continue buying the trial size because I do love using it before I put makeup on. My CoverGirl foundation goes on a lot smoother with it and the feel when I'm done my makeup is much softer. My Olay Check List Goes as Follows: 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - I saw no difference 2. Evens skin tone appearance - I saw no difference 3. Enhances brightness - I did find my face brighter. Even when I have makeup on. 4. Minimizes the look of pores - I saw no difference 5. Visibly reduces age spots - All my spots are still very noticeable. I think I may need a different product for this problem. 6. Restores firmness - I saw no difference 7. Replenishes moisture - I loved this part of the product as I said it made wearing makeup an almost daily thing for me.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer... so far so good! I have super sensitive skin and have a mild case of Rosacia... I rarely try any product that doesn't cause me red, itchy, and super dry skin... until now! This Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer really is gentle on my face. I have been using it for 1 1/2 weeks now... so far so good. It goes on smoothly, not greasy and quite light.. and absorbs quickly leaving a nice matte finish on my skin. It is great under makeup and I find it doesn't cause me any issues with my sensitive skin at all. I find a little goes a long way and the pump design works well to let me have just a small amount at a time so I am not wasting it. I am unsure if it delivers on all it promises as I haven't been using it long enough. Will report again in a few weeks and see where I am at. I am liking though which I never thought I would say about any product promising multiple benefits. I do think that so far it replenishes moisture and reduces the look of pores.

"Olay is just Okay The Olay Total Effects product boasts that it will help fight the signs of aging which sounds very attractive and tempting for people who are getting older and the signs of aging are beginning to show on our faces, like me. I've used the product for about two weeks now and I can only say that the product is okay. It's not the best and not the worst I've tried. The product does seem to work as I can see some of my age spots beginning to lighten up and I've noticed that my skin tone is beginning to even out. I think that if I continue using it I will begin to see the results and that change does happen. However, I don't think I will be purchasing this product once I'm done because I always get this little stinging sensation after I put it on. It doesn't turn red or irritate my skin or anything which is quite odd. Other than that, I found that the product made my skin look dewy for a it after I put it on and it absorbed quite fast. I didn't have to stand around and wait for it to absorb before I put on other products. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"after 1 weeks use Initial thoughts A little about my skin: I have oily acne prone skin. By mid day I can go through approximately 2 of the oil blotting papers and have them completely see through. I use topical acne products which tend to make my face fairly dry. So I technically have oily, dry, acne prone skin. I know, aren't I lucky Haha. From my acne I have a great deal of scaring and pigmentation. I am 25 so I don't have wrinkles (just yet). My hopes for the product: I was hoping the product would help even my skin tone and help minimize the appearance of dark scares and hyperpigmentation. I was also hoping the product would moisturize my skin and help make it feel less dry (especially since it's winter time and the dry cold wind doesn't help my skins dryness). Hard to test, but I was also hoping the product would help prevent wrinkles. First week of using it: The product went on smoothly and had a nice smell. No initial breakouts which is shocking since most moisturizers tend to make my skin break out. No visible improvements in the texture or hyperpigmentation of my skin after the first week.

"Did not agree with my skin Given that Olay is a reputable brand that has been around for years I was really excited to try the Olay Total Effects. I incorporated it into my daily regimen and this was the only moisturizer I used. The cream smells fantastic and it was extremely moisturizing however it did not agree with my skin. I used it every day for about 3 weeks. By mid day my skin was extremely oily and after the first week I started breaking out. I did not see any of the changes the product claimed to do but did find that my skin was very moisturizer. I found that after washing my face and applying the cream, the areas I had broken out in would slightly burn and if the product accidentally got around my eye area that would burn to. I had high expectations for this but found it to be a let down. I will not be purchasing but I hope it worked well for others who got to try it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Quenched My Parched Dry-Sensitive Skin If you're looking for a lightweight but highly moisturizing product for sensitive skin I'd highly recommend this. Prior to using this product my skin was so dry that it was flaky, I tried various other products that were supposed to be hypoallergenic but I ended up with red, parched skin. Within two applications of this product I could definitely tell my skin was healing. My skin gradually became smoother, brighter and I could see a slight change in tone. I'm excited to see if there are other improvements with long term use of this product Pros: Hydrating, Lightweight, Smoother and Brighter Skin, Slight Improvement in Tone, can wear under makeup, quickly blended into skin Cons: Didn't notice a reduction in wrinkles, but it may takes longer to see results Best Uses: Everyday moisturizer Based only on the moisturizing properties alone, I would definitely purchase this product again. I only gave three stars because I did not see a decrease in my fine lines and wrinkles, but as I mentioned, my skin was really parched so it may take longer for me to see these results as my skin repairs.

"It's good for moisturizing but not sure about anti-aging I'm not a big product person when it comes to my face. I don't wear a ton of makeup and my morning/evening routines are quite simple. The one thing I do daily is moisturizer my face. I have very dry skin and I'm constantly looking for a moisturizer that will nourish without feeling heavy and greasy. In regards to those criteria this product is great! What I love is that I don't need to use a lot (a little goes a long way) each time I apply. It goes on nice and smooth and absorbs into my skin quickly so I don't feel all greasy. In terms of dryness I have noticed a bit of a difference - the skin around my nose isn't as dry as it used to be. The scent of the moisturizer is very pleasant. Not over powering at all. Which is nice as I hate feeling like I'm inhaling a perfume factory on my face! Now I'm regards to the anti aging/smoothing out skin claims I'm not sure if I see much difference in my face. Now to be fair I'm daily young and don't really have any fine lines, etc so perhaps at this point in my life the anti aging thing isn't something I need to worry about. I like this product, and depending on what it retails for I think I'd consider purchasing it on my own in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Tired Mom Day 1 As a new mother I feel like I am in a whole new body. Especially my skin! I am tired and run down and it shows. I also don't have that much time in the morning to apply all the lotions and potions I used to so I need something to carry a lot of punch! With the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer I am hoping for just that. I also need something that is easy to apply and not have to worry about a mess. I love that it has a pump! So far day one my skin feels moisturized, there is a slight hint of scent that isn't too over powering (I do prefer things to be fragrance free especially with a new baby) . It was easy to apply and didn't leave a greasy feeling (which I hate with other skin products). Will see how my skin feels in a few weeks, especially as winter has really started here.

"A pretty ok face cream I tried this cream a few times and I don't know if it's just that I can't get into a facial moisturising routine, or if I really didn't like the cream, but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Maybe more consistent use would show me some of the anti-aging effects that they advertise, but I couldn't get over the scent and the feel on my skin to use it every day. The 5 or more times I tried it, I found the scent was the standard olay scent that reminded me of a more modern version of my grandma's old olay scent. I found the cream to be a bit greasy going on, and then despite my face being somewhat on the dry side, the cream didn't absorb as well as I would have liked it to. I will likely continue to use small portions of it on particularly dry areas of my face (chin, nose, etc), but it wasn't a great daily moisturizer for me.

Dry Skin Rescue This Deep Hydration Cream genuinely lives up to its' name and its' claim. Deep Hydration Cream gives immediate results with deep moisture that hydrates instantly yet lasts for hours. I find it soothing even for my very sensitive skin. Highly recommend!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"A lot in a little bottle... I was very surprised when I received the Olay Total Effects 7in1 trial sized bottle. I didn't think it would be possible to see results by the end of the bottle. I was pleasantly surprised. My immediate reaction to the moisturizer with the light scent and creamy texture. Very little was needed to cover my whole face and neck. It went on smooth and absorbed quickly. My skin instantly felt soft and smooth. Over time, I noticed that the vitamin complex in Olay Total Effects was actually beginning to fight some of the 7 signs of aging. For me, the first signs which began to improve was my uneven skin tone and the fine lines between my eyebrows began to soften. I didn't look as angry as I usually do. After many weeks of using this product my skin improves everyday. My skin is defiantly more hydrated and therefore looks much healthier. I like how my makeup can easily be worn on top of this product and stays put with very little retouching. I will continuing to use this moisturizer and watch as my skin improves while fighting the signs of aging. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Olay Olay Anti-Aging Moisturizer I've never tried Olay, so this was a first for me. The packaging was like any other anti-aging moisturizer product. The scent was nice and the texture of the moisturizer was nice and smooth too. I've tested the product for about a week now and here are the results: (Just to let you know, I'm in my young thirties, normal-dry skin and no visible wrinkles or lines except for 1-2 frown lines near mouth) Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - No noticeable change! Evens skin tone appearance - Some changes Enhances brightness - Skin got brighter after second day! Minimizes the look of pores - Yes! Visibly reduces age spots - Don't have any Restores firmness - Not noticeable! Replenishes moisture - Yess!!! Smooth and hydrated skin after first application! So, I got 4/7 out of the moisturizer! Would I recommend it Not for my age group! It might work more effectively for 40s and up! SO for me I would stick to a regular moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great moisturizer, not oily. After trying out Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks I can say that it's pretty good. I like that it moisturizes well, yet is not oily. I have very oily skin and it does not make me a greaseball at the end of the day. It also does not make me break out, which is awesome. It has no offense smell. I like the pump dispenser which is sanitary. I have not noticed any changes in fine lines nor is my skin tone more even. However, these are not huge problem areas for me. I also do not have any age spots, so I can't say if their claim to reduce the appearance of age spots is accurate or not. My main concerns are to keep my oily face from glistening at the end of the day and to not break out (have acne on my face). This Olay product addresses my concerns. The thing I do not like about this moisturizer is that it contains parabens. I am trying to use more natural products without parabens and other preservatives. If you do not mind parabens then you should try this product. It's good in other regards. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good moisture, not sure about the 7 effects My skin is fairly dry and I found that Olay Total Effects did a good job at moisturizing my skin. Some moisturizers make my skin red and hot, but this one was ok. I was a bit concerned because it isn't fragrance free. I don't really understand perfuming your face, but this product wasn't too strong. I can't say I noticed much change in my fine lines or skin texture. Basically all i found was that this product does as good a job as my regular moisturizer. However, my regular moisturizer has SPF while the Olay Total Effects does not. Kind of ironic to have a moisturizer that fights the seven signs of aging without helping to *prevent* aging with SPF!! I also noticed that after about a week of using the product once a day, I started getting some pimples. I haven't had pimples for years, so I was a bit surprised to see them popping up. The only change I made was my moisturizer, so I suspect the pimples are related to that. So, while this product did a good job of moisturizing my dry skin, its has more drawbacks for me than positives. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Canadian winters are known for harshness Canadian winters are known for harshness and I live on the East coast so that is almost a double wammy. I was lucky to received the Olay Total Effects complements of Olay from Buzz Agent to try out. I find myself looking for moisturizers and sun protection all at the same time since I find that the snow sometimes makes the sun burns worse for winter activities and when we do have beautiful weather I want to be out there soaking it up. Its a good product. My face is very sensitive but this doesn't affect that. My skin feels softer and is less dry then usual in this weather however I haven't an increase in youthfulness of my skin. The cream is slightly thicker than I am used to and it doesn't have a strong fragrance. It applies easily, but I found it took a while to sink into my skin. However since it does provide moisture to my face but I don't really notice the benefits of anti-aging I am scoring the product in the middle of the road. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not enough for 40+ Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a great product if you start using it in your 30's, but when you're closer to 50 there's just not enough of what mature skin needs to produce visible effects, it's a very effective moisturizer, but for age spots and uneven skin tone it merely provides an optical illusion, any decent moisturizer will reduce the appearance of fine lines, at least temporarily. My skin does feel silky smooth and it is wonderful for making make-up apply better. The scent is a tiny bit strong when first applied, but that fades in a matter of minutes. All that being said, this is only 2 weeks in, and I will definitely give the product the full 4 weeks and post again. I am however very impressed with the size, to be able to purchase something this size at a reasonable price rather than having to pay for a full size of something that may not work for you is fantastic, if only other products would take the hint.

"Olay Total Effects 7 In one Anti-Aging Moisturizer I have tried the Olay Total Effects 7 in one Anti-Aging Moisturizer for five weeks now. I am not finding that it is any better than the moisturizer that I have been using for the past couple of years. It claims that is minimizes the look of pours, I haven't seen a difference at all in mine. I still can see the two age spots that I have on my face. As far as making the statement that it visibly smooths fine lines and wrinkles, I can just say that I haven't gotten any more nor have they gotten worse. I did like that it is a thick cream. It does not leave your face greasy looking. My skin absorbed it right away. The pump is a nice touch. No one from work noticed any difference in my skin. I'm sorry but I would not go out and buy the Olay Total Effects 7 in one Anti-Aging Moisturizer from Olay. I would like to thank Olay and BzzAgent for giving me the opportunity to try the moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Total Effects 7 Moisturizer I think this a very nice moisturizer. It pumps easily out of the container and has a very mild but pleasing scent. Some people may find it completely scentless. I have been applying to my neck and face daily for the past two weeks. It applies easily and becomes quickly and fully absorbed without leaving any residue. There is no greasy after feel. The biggest effect I noticed was improved skin tone and moisture replacement. My skin feels firmer and more hydrated. I do not have very large pores so I have not noticed a change there. I have a few sun spots and have not noticed a marked difference in their color and size. I have not noticed a difference in wrinkle reduction. I would give this product 3 stars. It is a nice moisturizer that makes your skin feel good. I would like to see more sun spot reduction as well as smoothing of wrinkles and fine lines. I will observe for the next couple of weeks and report again. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Olay total effects 7 in 1 Olay Total effects is a thicker facial cream meant to help with the ever aging skin. I have never been much of a person to carry on a regime of skin car but I thought maybe after trying the product and seeing results it would change my mind. I was wrong. Though the creams texture is rich and thicker I really didn't see any difference from all the other creams I have tried. I must admit I did like how soft and smooth my skin felt but other then that to me it was just another cream. Mind you opposed to other creams I've used it is one of the most affordable. Remember as well my skin has already suffered from some of the aging signs including fine lines and wrinkles. Maybe if this cream was used before some of these things began on my skin my thoughts may be different. For me I am not sure I would go out to purchase this product. Not enough positive to make me run to the store to buy. Sorry Olay Total Effects... This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Good moisturizer but not a miracle Having tried this moisturizer for a few weeks I have found that this is a good product. I like that this lotion isn't super heavy but it also isn't one of those extra light milks. I have combination skin with an oily congested t-zone. This soothes the dry parts of my face but doesn't irritate the oily parts. I didn't notice any changes in the brightness, tone or fine lines on my skin. Perhaps after a longer period of usage I would see some of the loftier claims but as of now this is just a good moisturizer. One thing I did notice was the smell. I really dislike scents but this one has a faint scent that reminds me of classic Oil of Olay products. Yay for nostalgia. Bottom line for me is that if you need a good drugstore moisturizer than this is a good one to think about. If you are looking for a miracle then maybe look into other kinds of products or cosmetic procedures. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The Very Best Moisturizer Of all the moisturizers I've used, Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream is the very best. It makes my face feel great as soon as I apply it. It reduces the small wrinkles on my face and gives me a special glow. I highly recommend this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great moisture I've been using Olay Total Effects anti-aging moisturizer during my nighttime routine have been very pleased with the moisturizing properties. I have combination skin, I find that my cheeks get dry as the seasons get colder. Even though the temperatures this fall winter have been very mild in my area, I have still noticed the dryness in the air effecting my skin elsewhere (lips, hands, legs, etc.). So, I am very pleased to notice that my facial skin has not felt dry since trying Olay Total Effects. However, I haven't seen a noticeable difference in some of the anti-aging effects that this product promises to deliver. That being said, I'm only 26 years old thankfully have not noticed many signs of aging anyway. I don't really have fine lines or wrinkles yet, nor do I have issues with age spots or firmness. But, I've always been told that it's never to early to start using anti-aging products, the keys to looking youthful are moisturizer sunscreen. So I think it would be a good idea for me to continue using this product hopefully I won't start to see the signs of aging for a very long time! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Would purchase! Right off, love the smell! Its a fresh, subtle smell that automatically makes me happier - not sure how a smell does that - but it does! I have oily T-Zone and acne prone skin. It didn't make me break out any more than what was already on my face, but I dont think it helped it disappear or anything. I have been using it now for almost 2 weeks every morning. It doesn't affect how my makeup goes on and doesnt make my face any more oiler than it already is. It moisturizes well enough that i dont need to reapply - so it does replenish moisture! (1 of 7). I didnt notice a huge difference with enhancing brightness or minimizes the look of my pores. I didnt have many wrinkles so i cant speak to that, but i can speak to my face feeling firmer. Over all, I feel if i had enough product to try for a longer period of time it would have helped but from the trial size I can say i am satisfied with the product and would probably purchase to try a full size just to see if the rest of the 7 effects is claims are true.

"Okay moisturizer, but not an anti-aging panacea I have used Olay Total Effects 7 in one Anti-Aging Moisturizer daily for two weeks. One pump and the lotion bottle dispenses an appropriate amount for spreading over my face. I am enjoying the light fragrance, and soft and non-greasy feel of the lotion. The moisturizer spreads fairly well and soaks into my skin quickly. My skin does feel a bit softer and more supple after use. That being said, Olay makes rather bold claims about what this anti-aging moisturizer will do. It boasts that the product visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles, evens skin tone appearance, enhances brightness, minimizes the look of pores, visibly reduces age spots, restores firmness, and replenishes moisture. I'm not sure my skin tone looks any more even or bright, or that my age spots are really any lighter. As a light moisturizer, this Olay product is alright, but I haven't noticed any dramatic changes. I'll continue using the moisturizer till it's finished.....perhaps there's a miracle in the bottom of the container! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Smooth as silk... O.kit's been over 4 weeks since i've put Olay Total Effects to the test. I love the packaging. I love that it only dispenses a little amount with every pump. Because you cannot put the product back in if you pump too much(which is good actually. You don't want product exposed and open to contamination or eventually expiration of quality). I appreciated the perfect amount that it pumped and on a very dry day i used a little more. It first feels very rich on my skin and i'm not sure if i'm going to like how heavy it feltthen it really just melted into my face. A little goes a long way. The scent is pleasant- almost too strong for my likingbut not off-putting. I have been using it religiously and have not noticed a change in the appearance of my skin. My skin tone remains the same. My age spots are still as front and centre as usual. And my wrinkles aren't any smoother. What i will tell you though.is my skin is baby soft!!! My husband even mentioned it. So definitely 10/10 for texture! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"it's good but not amazing I think that I went into this campaign thinking, yes, this promises to do really well on my skin. After using it for a while now, I don't notice much going on. I feel like I need to use more than directed because my skin gets dry -- more so than before... My skin doesn't look any younger and I honestly didn't really believe it would. The seven signs of aging they say will improve but again, I don't see it. I like the texture of the product and the way it blends into my skin. I like how it doesn't have a strong scent or close to no scent at all. I'm in my early 30's so maybe I can't be compared to someone who has more signs of aging for example a 60 year old... and maybe this targets older skin But I do have oily-ish skin and this kind of makes my skin dry... from one opposite to another... All in all I don't think I will buy this product because it's not right for me but I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it because I've heard good results and so many people use it.

"Great moisturizer but not for me.. I loved the trial size version of this product. One pump was enough to cover my entire face - a little goes a long way. The cream itself is light and airy, with a smooth texture. I loved this as a moisturizer, my skin was soft and there were no dry spots on my face, which is normal for this time of year for me. I didn't notice any change in the brightness, skin tone, fine lines or wrinkles, or any of the other effect -other than moisturize. I've used the product daily for over 3 weeks now and although I enjoy it as a moisturizer, I won't continue using the product. I've been having outbreaks of pimples (big) on my chin area since using. This is unlike my skin, as I don't have an issue with breakouts and acne. I've used many Olay products in the past, and have been satisfied, but I can't say the same with this product - unfortunately, as I do wish it worked with my skin! If it weren't for the breakouts, I'd continue to use - so if you haven't yet, give it a try! *the attached photo was a before shot This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Doesn't live up to family hype I come from a long line of Olay users. I still remember that distinctive smell that it gave my grandmother. So I was pretty excited to give An Olay product a try. In the past the price along was enough to divert me to my current Aveeno moisturizer. And I think I'll stick with the Aveeno. The first time I applied Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 moisturizer it burned a little, but I chalked that up to how dry my skin must be. That old familiar Olay scent was there- and it's not as appealing as I recall. Actually, it smells a bit like an old lady. What was nice about it was that it was non-greasy and kept my skin moisturized for most of the day. I've only been using it for 5 days, so can't comment on the age defying effects, but since I'd need to buy more to have enough to use it for the 4 weeks that is recommended to see results, I don't think I'll get there. Sorry, Olay, the women in my family in previous generations have been dedicated but this girl is sticking with the much less expensive and equally effective Aveeno!

"OK, but... I was excited to try the Olay Total Effects, as I normally use an inexpensive cream moisturizer. As a 50-something, I was hoping it would produce some great results. Unfortunately, even after using it for a few weeks, the results have been underwhelming. While it did appear to fade an age spot, which was wonderful, it really didn't do anything for the fine lines or wrinkles - certainly not enough for anyone to comment on - maybe my lines and wrinkles are too well developed! Also, I had to stop using it on my nose, as it broke out - something that hasn't happened since my teenage years. It does have a nice feel - smooth and silky - goes on easily, doesn't have a strong smell, and comes in a cute little container that dispenses easily - all positives. Overall, it works fine as a moisturizer (except on my nose), seems to fade age spots a bit, but does nothing for my lines and wrinkles. Given the price point compared to my inexpensive cream moisturizer, I won't be switching. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Satisfactory Job I have finished using the sample size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Putting my initial concerns aside regarding the alcohol based ingredients I must say that using this product was a pleasurable experience. My skin looks and feels smooth and soft and I maintain a healthy glow. This product is not heavily perfumed however it does have a light scent. For me, the fragrance was not an irritant and I quite enjoyed it. My conclusion is that while this product performed well in making my skin appear smoother, it would also be a bit pricey to maintain use. The trial size product may help to keep cost down but, there are other, more comparable, products on the market that can give you similar or better results for less money. I am satisfied with my experience in using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer but, I will most likely continue using my previous products. In the end, I was glad that I had the opportunity to try it. At the very least, it's worth giving it a try. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer claims to have the following effects: 1.Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles 2.Evens skin tone appearance 3.Enhances brightness 4.Minimizes the look of pores 5.Visibly reduces age spots 6.Restores firmness 7.Replenishes moisture I used this product diligently everyday (sometimes twice a day) for a month. I did not notice any changes except that my skin was adequately moisturised with it's use. The moisturiser went on smoothly and felt light on my face. It did not irritate my sensitive skin. It has a pleasant scent. I was hoping to see a difference in the lines and wrinkles on my face, but unfortunately I did not. Perhaps with prolonged use I might see a difference. The product container was easy to use. Just one pump dispensed enough of the moisturiser to adequately cover my face and neck. I may purchase this product (on sale) as a summer moisturiser when I want something light on my face. Thank You BzzAgent for the opportunity to trial this product!

"Olay Okay. I've just finished my four week trial of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. If you caught my first review, you know that I loved many things about this moisturizer, including that it is fragrance-free, the light luxurious and non-oily feel of the lotion, and the fact that it contains many vitamins and anti-oxidants. What I really wanted to know was if it would truly get rid of my fine lines on my forehead. So I took a photo on day 1 and a photo on day 28 to see if there was a difference. To be honest, the difference seems very minimal to me. All of the things I liked about the product from the start still hold true today. In general it did a good job of keeping my face moisturized, but on several occasions when my skin was more dehydrated it didn't do quite enough to keep the skin from looking dry. I found it worked best when my face was damp, and the product spread further that way. I gave it a 3/5 because although it didn't really get rid of my fine lines, it still feels nice on my face.

"Improved complexion endorsement Since using the sample I perceive an improvement overall t is not drastic but definitely discernible enough so that I feel confident enough to encourage two people close to me to try the product as well. I have bought product (unscented/sensitive) for myself and used points (shoppers drug mart) to acquire the same for my Mother. Her skin is good except for darkness around the eyes and a bit of slackness. She has been using it for days now and hasn't reported any improvement to me yet but I expect that in time she will notice a brightening of overall tone, firming and lightening and reduction of fine lines around the eyes and corner of the mouth. Otherwise she has great skin for a 60+ year old. I've have shared my sample with a friend who requires more convincing. I've portioned out some of mine for her, enough for her to use for a month. She works in a kitchen and doesn't take great care with herself though I encourage her to. I've also encouraged her to take vitamins and and bought her body care products (olay body wash and body lotion) are well as we a both getting on (40+). I am sure that she will definitely notice improvements faster than my Mother if she sticks to a regime of daily use, this is issue with her. I will have to stay on her so that she remembers to stick to it. Her skin could be improved with better texture, reduction of uneven tone and reduction of pores and lines. She will improve if I keep on her and I hope that in about 10 more days she will see improvements for herself. At the moment I perceive a reduction in redness and blotchiness. Her pores are not as visible as mine and I am sure we will both see improvements soon. I suggested using the cream at night as it is easy to skip things in the morning rush. Thank you for including me in this campaign, I will continue to use Olay 7 day throughout the winter as this is the time of year that skin issues come to the fore.

"Review of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I received the trial size bottle of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer to try out, courtesy of Olay. It is a great size for travel, or even for those who don't go through a lot of product and don't want a full size bottle on their sink. After using the moisturizer for a few weeks, I am breaking down the 7 effects that are claimed in relation to how I feel they applied to my use. 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles: I don't have a lot of lines just yet, but this product made applying my makeup smoother with less creasing. 2. Evens skin tone appearance: I didn't find a change in my skin tone - I tend to have redness and discoloration in some areas and this remained the same. 3. Enhances brightness: I did not find a difference in the brightness of my complexion. 4. Minimizes the look of pores: The Olay moisturizer was a nice base before my foundation, and did smooth out my few visible pores around my nose. 5. Visibly reduces age spots: I cannot comment to this claim, since age spots are not a factor (yet!) 6. Restores firmness: My skin did feel nice and smooth/supple after applying. 7. Replenishes moisture: I found that this product would likely be better in the summer for me. It is a light moisturizer, and couldn't quite combat the tightness of my drier winter skin. I have combination skin, but it wasn't quite hydrating enough this fall/winter. I would probably recommend this product for skin that is a bit oilier, or in milder weather. Overall, I found Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer to be a nice lightweight moisturizer which absorbed into my skin well, and had a mild, pleasant scent. It does claim to be fragrance free, however it does have a faint scent to it. Although I don't see the brightening effects mentioned, or evening of my skin tone, this would be a good summer moisturizer, and a handy size. I only wish it had been a little more hydrating for me.

"Olay, you had me until I broke out I am a person who is used to being told I look much younger than my age, and quite frankly, I would like to keep it that way, so I was pretty excited to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer as I have begun to start showing the signs of aging around my eyes and thought this was a great opportunity to give another product a shot at diminishing those nasty little wrinkles. I was also quite excited to see if my pores would actually minimize in size as I have noticed that with aging, my pores have gotten larger. On a daily basis, I usually use an oil free moisturizer containing SPF 15, then at night, after washing and applying toner, I apply an anti aging serum. My skin is sensitive and can be adult acne prone, so I decided I would only use the Olay Total Effects and continue with my regular washing and toner habit. At first, I felt positively about the new moisturizer it felt great on my skin, it wasn't too thick when applying and my makeup went on smoothly atop of it. I even told some fellow mom's about how it was keeping my face feeling fresh, even in the snowy weather we had been having. I continued with my new routine for a few days, then I noticed that my skin was becoming a bit aggravated and I started breaking out (uh oh). I became a little concerned, but continued using Olay Total Effects, but still, I broke out and I had to discontinue its use (because honestly, I'll take clear skin over some small wrinkles). I have looked at the ingredients, and although it is oil free (a huge plus), it does contain glycerin, which can cause my skin to become irritated. Although I didn't get to use the product for the suggested length of time to see its full effect on my wrinkles or my pores, I can say that a person would feel moisturized throughout the day, even in harsh winter weather and can feel confident about her makeup staying on atop of it. Perhaps a person with less sensitive skin can find the results they are looking for Sorry Olay, I gave it a shot, but my skin was just too sensitive for your product, *sigh.

"Time Will Tell In order to properly review this product in the hopes of helping others make an informed buying decision, I need to use the product over an extended period of time. I have only been using the product for 3 days and I would like to at least give it a week to see what it is capable of. This review will be one of two with this one commenting on the product itself and my opinions on that. I have used Olay products in the past and I have not been a fan due to the fact that they have either broken me out or made me feel really oily and greasy. First off, I LOVE that the Olay Total Effects is oil free. As someone with highly sensitive skin, this is a winner for me already. I break out super easily and although it is still to early to tell, I don't anticipate this being harmful on my skin. It contains a few different Vitamins and claims not to be harsh on skin so I am excited to see what it is able to do for me. There is a mild scent in the lotion but it is nothing overpowering or distasteful - I usually prefer a scented lotion but it feels awkward when it is scented and on my face... I do wish that it was fragrance free but it is mild enough that it will not be a deal breaker for me. As I have noticed with previous Olay Products I have tried for my face, this one is not greasy. Maybe that has to do with the fact that it is oil free I am not sure exactly, but I find that it is fast absorbing as it claims and it does not leave my face makeup streaky or greasy. My only complaint with the lotion is that it feels a bit heavy on my face. I prefer to not be able to feel what I have on my face and this scares me as I feel like it is not giving my pores room to breathe AKA I do not want to break out! Lastly, I love the 7 in 1 idea but I question whether it is truly possible. The sellers for me in this lotion are the effects of evens skin tone appearance, brightness, and moisture. This excites me because I feel like out of the 7 things it claims to do, my three struggles are the easiest three to fix. So far, I would say that I am 50/50 on the product. I like how the product is oil-free and not greasy, but I find it heavy on my face. I love how it claims to be gentle on the skin but I am hesitant on that claim based on my previous experiences with the Olay brand. So far I am satisfied with my three day results although I don't feel it is accurate to lay claim until I have given the product about a week to work. My skin does feel great and the lotion is moisturizing but so far I can't say that it is better than the lotion I currently use. I will update in about 5 days with a review on the 7 Olay Effects! Stay Tuned! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream I can always depend on Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream to keep my face smooth and young looking.

unique formula gave my face a new tone I loved how moisturized my face felt afterwards. Didn't leave it dry feeling like other ones I've tried in the past! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Met most claims, but very drying - I won't be buying. I gave this a rating of three even though I won't be purchasing this again because I do think it is a product that lives up to many of the claims. However, I found it to actually be very drying on my skin, and actually by about day three found I was having to put another moisturizer on after it just to get rid of that tight skin feeling on my face. I made sure to just use a regular body moisturizer though so that I could see how it did on other claims. Here are my observations: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - yes, Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging did help with fine lines and wrinkles, but I don't think it did significantly better than my regular brand (Loreal) at this. Evens skin tone appearance - I didn't notice a difference, but to be fair my skin tone is pretty even in general. Enhances brightness - I thought that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging did well in this category. My skin definitely looked brighter when I used it. Minimizes the look of pores - also thought that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging did well at this. I usually use Biore strips on my nose and didn't even need to while I was applying this (and I was checking closely! lol). Visibly reduces age spots - Another category that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging did well in. I don't have a lot of age spots, but hey I'm 41 there are a few! It did do a good job at visibly reducing those I do have. Restores firmness - I didn't find that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging made much of a difference in this category versus my normal cream (Loreal). Replenishes moisture - definite fail in this category. Right from night one when I applied the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging cream my skin felt tight and dry. I resisted putting on any other moisturizers the first couple of nights, but it was pretty extreme (to the point I was so happy to put my morning cream on).

"Almost, but not quite Initially, I was thrilled to be a part of this campaign. Oil of Olay has a strong reputation for being a dependable product and I even use the soap to wash my face. As I have sensitive skin there are only a few types of cleansers that I can use. So, when it came to trying the oil of Olay seven in one antiaging moisturizer I was excited. When I got the trial size I have to admit, I didn't read all the fine print and I was a little disappointed that it was only the trial size, but having the opportunity to try moisturizer that was less expensive then the current antiaging moisturizer I am using I wanted to give it a try. I had to use more than was necessary, due to the fact that I live in a cold climate. It had minimal smell, which is important to me, because I am sensitive to fragrances. I was also excited, that the moisturizer did not irritate my skin. I live in Alberta where the weather can be extreme from one end to the other, I found that I needed to use a fair amount of the moisturizer to compensate for the dry cold winter weather that I was experiencing with my face. It would've been nice to have a full bottle to see The claims that the moisturizer was advertising. I found that trying to sample size bottle it was not enough for me to make the claims that the bottle was stating. Overall the oil of Olay seven in one antiaging moisturizer was OK. If I had to try it again, I would buy a full-size bottle. I would however, try it in the summer because of the extreme weather I live in. I need a much heavier moisturizer to combat the dryness that I experience in the winter months here. The trial size bottle maybe good for little getaways where you need a quick moisturizer but as a daily dependable moisturizer I was neutral. I would try it again but I would need to try it for the full 30 days to see if the claims it's making are actually true. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"not bad, not great I have been using this moisturizer every morning and night for over a week. I must say it does work however I am not a huge fan of the smell. I also found it to be a bit oily and very expensive for what you get. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer I do like the feel of this lotion on my face, soft and smooth. But as for the looking 10 year younger in 4 weeks, I don't believe that it does. I have not had any compliments on my skin looking younger. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

The effects are quite subtle Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer appears to have made my skin tone more even. A friend even commented that my skin looks brighter. I'm not sure if it helped with the fine lines This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"My Go To Moisturizer This is my Go To Product Daily!

"Good Everyday Moisturizer I received the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer to review. I really like that this product had a pump which allowed the perfect amount to be dispensed each time. It also allows for an easy and clean application. The product is more of a cream consistency and is lightly fragranced. The product claims to fight seven signs of aging: 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles 2. Evens skin tone appearance 3. Enhances brightness 4. Minimizes the look of pores 5. Visibly reduces age spots 6. Restores firmness 7. Replenishes moisture After trying this product for 2 weeks I can honestly say I did not see all of the above results. I did find that the moisturizer evened out my skin tone. My skin tone was less red looking and more uniform. I also found the moisturizer did replenish moisture and left my skin nicely hydrated for the whole day. As for the other benefits, I did not see any results. I have very fine lines around my eyes but saw no change. My skin still seemed to have a dull appearance. I have large pores in the cheek area close to my nose but didn't find they were minimized with the use of this product. I didn't notice any change in the firmness of my skin. I actually don't have age spots yet so I can't really comment on that aspect. Perhaps with continued use of this product I would see more of the claimed benefits in my skin. I do suffer from oily, acne prone skin. I'm happy to report that my skin did not get any oilier than usual. However, I did develop a few pimples while using this product. Maybe it was too rich for my skin or maybe I was going to get those pimples regardless of what I used. My final opinion on this product is that it is an excellent moisturizer but not a good anti-aging moisturizer. I would recommend it as a good every day moisturizer but would skip it for its anti-aging benefits. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
works like any other cream I didn't find any improvement with this cream. in terms of wrinkles or fine lines. It did feel good on my face and I would use it again if only to use under my foundation. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"I wil only use in the Summer months Originally, It worked great! During the winter months my skin is awfully dry and I need something that is much more moisturizing.

"Grandmother knows best! When I was 13 years old my grandmother told me to start using Oil of Olay. I have been a believer ever since.

"Great hydratation I think its a good cream for the price range, it left my skin soft and hydrated.

"So far, so good! Got this the other day, and started using it that night. I haven't noticed any results yet, but I love the soft scent of it, and how it doesn't make my face oily when I put it on.

"Smells good, but a bit oily for me I always have confidence on Olay products. I think it is still too soon to see noticeable result after using the trial version, but it does smells good and comfortable to put on. Maybe it's due to having SPF, I find it a bit too oily for my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not to bad Although i didnt see younger healthier skin, the olay total effects 7 in 1 did make my face softer so thats a plus. I'm sure if I continued to use this product longer I would notice the difference. It is a great product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Very smooth I have used for a couple of years and are very happy
"Feels great not seeing a result The moisturizer is feeling great when putting it on, and i like the light texture.

nicole lamarre the product made my skin glow and look refreshed and my wrinkles and lines seemed smoothed but the olny draw back down fall was it seemed too have too much alcohol in it so it dryed my face out as i have sensitive skin other wise all around a great product !!!!

Age defying I think the oil of olay products in general are great but not too sure this on is for me I how how much it moisturised my face and made it very soft but didn't like how tight it made my skin feel so for me about 50/50 like part but not all aspects of this product This review was collected as part of a promotion.
17575560690 Great on dry skin.love the way it makes your skin feel soft and hydrated.
Love This product!!!! I can't give this product a perfect 10 just yet! I have only been using it for 3 days now. So far I absolutely love the way it makes my skin feel and look......it has really changed the evenness of my skin tone in as little as 3 days. I can't wait to see the results after a couple of weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Good moisturizer I think that this works as a moisturizer. I didn't see much of an improvement in fine lines around my eyes. I'm not sure if I would purchase this particular product for fine line reduction. I would however purchase other olay products if they moisurize as good as this. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Okay for dry skin Olay Total Effects is okay as a moisturiser, but maybe you need to use it longer to get the full benefits of the 7 claims. It goes on smoothly and feels silky, but is eventually a little greasy feeling (glowing is a nicer word) after a few hours. If your skin is very dry, this might be a good choice.

Olay Review The product is not bad. Many similar products on the market. Anti-aging is great in skin care product. Would be great long term benefits. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Lightweight moisturizer I have tried Olay 7 effects for a free trial. I think that the moisturizer feels nice when applied. especially good for winter months. I don't think that there is any difference in fine lines or pore size but I would continue to use this moisturizer as my skin feels soft and does not cause breakouts This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Like it but don't love it. I put some in my hand and instantly loved the texture and weight of the lotion, not too thick or heavy and silky smooth. I love the way it feels on my skin and my skin feels extra soft since I've started using it but, I've seen no improvement in tone, scarring or fine lines. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This is one of my favorites. I switch it up from time to time with different Olay products, but always come back to this one. The product is smooth and light (and slightly pink which I love), spreads easily and is quickly absorbed. You don't have to use a large amount. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Pinkbandit I think anyone looking for a great moisturizer should try this Olay product that I received free to try from Bzzagent. This is by far the best moisturizer I have used in a very long time, my face feels great all day long, this cream has my face looking and feeling healthy. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay total effects The cream felt nice but I have not noticed any real difference in my face. I don't know if given enough time there would be any kind of difference but I am out of the sample. Sorry but I won't buy a full size product without at least seeing real progress from the sample size. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"It's ok.., The cream is ok.. Still left some dry patches on my skin in this cold weather, so I think something a bit more is needed at this time of year. The smell wasn't that great. I would prefer a different scent. I didn't notice any difference from any other face cream. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"may or may not be for you even though this product goes on easily and does not leave any residue on your face, and makes your skin feel smooth, I really have not seen any difference appearance wise!!!

"more even lines I noticed since trying Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, that my fine lines are more even. My skin felt smooth. I liked the smell of the product, it wasn't overpowering. My skin wasn't as dry, especially for winter. I give this product 3/5. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Unsure at this time I received my trial size of Olay Total Effects 7. Once I got it I put it to use. I'm not sure how I feel about it yet. It kinda leaves my skin a little greasy and heavy feeling. I like the idea of the trial size (available to all in Feb.) Try it out cost efficiently first. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"My skin is now pre dry than it's ever been I've been using Olay moisturizers for over 10 years and for some reason this one dried my skin out instead of moisturizing it. It feels greasy going on which also disappointed me. I've always loved play as a brand, and the moisutrizer I'm used to using has never dried my skin the way this one has.

"Why No fragrance-free Formula Today is my first time using this product. Felt great going on immediately, felt moisturized without being too greasy. Although it smells great I would have loved to have this formula in a fragrance-free option, my skin tends to be a little sensitive to fragrances, but I will give a final review in a couple of weeks"
Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream I have been using this cream for a few years now and have gotten many compliments on how young I look. I'm asked what's your secret I love this cream and recommend it to all women. In just one day of using it your skin will feel softer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"it's ok for my neck and chest I have a very hard time to find a moisturizer for my very oily skin. I don't mind using this at night, as I find it makes my faces oily during the day. But I do use it every day on my neck and chest. And I really like it. It does not break me out, and it doesn't feel creasy. I would buy this for this reason only. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great for light weight mositurizing I think this is a great product for someone who doesn't need an intense mositurizing cream. I found it absorbed quickly and left my skin a little too dry. Great firming and evening though. Would definitely recommend it for someone who doesn't need a lot of moisture but would like the anti-aging benefits.

Olay Total effects 7 Received this small sample sized pump bottle. I've used it continually morning and night for two weeks. Haven't seen any change in my skin tone or the fine lines on my forehead.

"Not impressed So far, I have not seen any noticeable difference but I realize it is early. The first thing that turned me off was the overpowering perfume smell. I do not want my face cream to be what people smell off me. It smells like old woman perfume from the 70's. Here is hoping the next few weeks using it, improve.

"Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I think this is a good product, brand name is very well know been around for years. However I find for me it didn't work. I broke out I have very sensitive skin. But it has a great smell goes on very nicely. You need to know if you have sensitive skin and do a test on your neck behind you hairline This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"It's OK. But Olayie! I actually really like Olay products but I found my skin was getting more and more oily as I was using this product. Mind you, my skin is softer and looks like there may be less wrinkles but the oily skin kinda canceled the good out I think Sorry Olay likely not going g to buy this product.

Simple Moisturizer I didn't see any real tell tale affects. However it did keep under my eyes properly moisturized but that was about it. There was no lightening of the dark circles or minimizing of thin lines. It just keep them looking fresh and alert. Perhaps not a product I would continue to use This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Seems good! I gave the very generous sample a try for 7 days. I thought my skin was feeling and looking great until about day 4, when I started to recognize the signs of an allergic reaction. While the cream is great, I was definitely allergic to the fragrance. I'd love to get an up scented version and give it a try! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not much different than other comparable creams Went on my face nicely. I like the pump bottle. It smells nice too. It's too early to tell if it works for anti-aging. There certainly weren't any immediate results. I have sensitive skin, and like many other creams with scent, I get little red bumps. Overall, didn't feel like it did anything for my skin that amazed me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is 50/50. It leaves my face feeling moist and so smooth without the greasy feeling BUT I found I broke out in acne around my neck line. Can't say if it because of this product only, might have to use it more to confirm, but I haven't broke out since I stopped using it This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Lovely product not sure on noticible effects This lotion felt very nice on the skin smooth, supple after application. In all honesty, I quite enjoy the product, however have not been able to discern an overly noticeable difference overall in my skin. I have avoided dry winter skin thus far, though, so perhaps that's been a perk of this product, I like to think This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Soft skin! Easy application! I used Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 faithfully. Although I didn't see my skin look any younger during my use, it was softer. I finished the bottle the day before yesterday. The cream was not thick but thin and went on fantastic. I'm not sure of the price but if it is reasonable I would probably give a full bottle a try.

"It's a good moisturizer I thought it was a good moisturizer. I found it went on matte and helped somewhat hide the look of pores and some skin imperfections. But within a couple hours, my face became overwhelmingly oily and I experienced a couple break outs. I did not notice any difference with fine lines, wrinkles or pores getting smaller.

"Not bad but ..., I was super excited to try this product but the first couple of days and I broke out :( not so fun ! I have sensitive skin and was afraid of this but after three days of using it I noticed my fine lines had reduced which were mostly on my forehead. my skin looks brighter! So I guess I am sold !! Great everyday moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"olay total effects I have been using it for a week and it does make my skin feel a lot softer. But as far as the fine lines and age spots, I still have them and they look exactly the same.

"Not Bad I like this moisturizer but the scent is killing me also, because I am very fair skinned I need a strong spf."
"Great moisturizer As my skin is aging and I'm in the dry state of Colorado, this is my go to moisturizer. I feel it completely moisturizers my face and makes it look fresher and less aged. My face appears smoother and brighter. I also likes the way it is a good base for any make-up regimen I follow it with. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"preliminary results good One day into my 4 weeks and so far so good! The lotion looks and feels nice, and it at the very least moisturizes my skin. I'll give it a while longer to see if it truly fights 7 signs of aging (all of which I have.) The smell is not too overpowering.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer The Pros - No discernible scent, oil-free, didn't give me a rash. The Cons - feels a little greasy, no spf protection. I may use the SPF version if I couldn't find my usual Oil of Olay. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
it works for me I've been using the Olay cream for a few weeks now. I like it. It does go on thick but other than that it makes my skin smooth and feel nice. I will continue to use this product This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great Moisturizer I love the new Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer! It smells fantastic and leaves your skin super soft and moisturized. The temperatures dropped here and I am always switching to a richer moisturizer for the winter and this one feels really great on my skin. If only it had some kind of SPF, that would make it perfect.

"Great Product! I think the oil of Olay moisturizer works great! It evens out my skin tone and definitely brightened my complexion:). I was surprised at how fast the product worked. I like the way the Oil of Olay feels on my skin, it didn't clog pores or cause any breakouts as other moisturizers have. I would absolutely recommend this moisturizer:)) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Light and smooth What I really like about this MOISTURIZER is how face it absorbs into the skin .. and doesn't leave my face feeling oily! I've noticeda slight difference in lines around my eyes not being so noticeable. Oh one more thing, it's scent is very mild ( scent sensitive) so that is something else o enjoyed about this product.

great moisturizer I've been using this for two weeks now. It works great as a moisturizer. It isn't oily and soaks in my skin very quickly. The added vitamins and anti-aging is a perk! I recommend this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer Review I enjoyed using this moisturizer. It smelled great and applied smooth and silkily. It was easily absorb into my skin. It moisturized nicely and shrink a few pores. I liked that it didn't make my skin feel greasy after. More time maybe needed to see if it works for its other claims like minimizing fine lines enhances brightness This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I can see and feel the difference! Now that I have been using Olay Total Effects for a couple of months I can really see the difference. My skin looks significantly smoother and brighter. It feels amazing too! I can't go a day without using it or I feel like I'm only half ready to face the day. I think that I will purchase this product once the sample is finished.

"Olay awesome Although it's still early in the usage time, I am starting to see tiny improvements to my laugh lines and crow's feet. One thing that I would improve is a reduction in the scent. I find it quite strong This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay 7 in 1 I like the feel of the Olay Total Effects. it is soft and creamy. I don't have any age spots or lack firmness for this product to correct, but I did notice a reduction of fine lines around m eyes. It was not greasy and absorbed into my skin quickly.

"Olay Total Effects I think it is great, I totally see a difference. I absorbs into the skin really easy, smells good, easy to use and a little goes a long way. I liked it alot. I would buy it for sure. What I would want to know before using would be if it clogs the pores and creates pimple like things on the skin. And also would it help with blotchy skin.

Olay anti aging moisturizer I received this product and have been using it for a week now. It is a light weight formula that still allows makeup to be applied normally. This formula isn't greasy and in a week I noticed the laugh lines around my eyes shrinking and deminishing. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a cheap solution to fine aging lines.

"Check the labels carefully I went to the store to get this product because I had seen in an advertisement that the sunscreen in it was SPF 30, but that is a similar product and not this same one. This only has SPF 15. I was disappointed because the store only carried this one. I think they should all be at least 30 SPF. Otherwise, I am a faithful Olay user."

Sfanjoy76!! I loved being able to try this free sample from oil of olay and bzzagent. I've never tried any form of antiaging product . I found my skin feeling smoother and softer after just one week of using it. It really seemed to bring my skin to life. With a great color and soft look. I will most definitely be buying this product once my sample runs out! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Good Moisturizer I've tested this product for a couple of weeks now. I do like how it moisturizes my skin, however I have not noticed any of the other benefits. Maybe it's because I haven't noticed many wrinkles or age spots, before starting to use the product. I would recommend this as a good moisturizer but I'm not convinced that it has any anti-aging properties. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
wonderful product I am so excited about this product. This moisturizer makes you feel like a cool breeze in the heat of the day. I was surprised how revived I felt when I put this on. I just wanted to lather it all over. It made me feel like I had just drank 2 cups of coffee. I love it and you will too. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Soft skin, new skin I received this as a sample from BzzAgent and Olay Total Effects. It was a good product. It made my skin soft on contact, but it did sting my skin a little. I would recommend this product to anyone without skin problems or ecsema. I had to give the rest to a family member, and they just loved it! Made our winter skin, look brand new again.

"Nice moisturizer I am not sure if this works in terms of anti-aging because those kinds of products are more of a preventative step for me. However, it is a nice daily moisturizer that helps to keep my skin soft and smooth. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Moisturizer I think this is one of the best I have used, my dry skin loved it! I don't usually wear makeup, with the Olay moisturizer on the makeup didn't make my skin feel dry or heavy. Skin instantly feels better! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My new favourite face cream! A good face cream is difficult to find at the best of times, but when you have sensitive, acne prone skin like mine it can be downright impossible. I decided to sign up and get a free trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer with the hopes that it's promises would pay off, and that my picky skin would tolerate the cream. When reading the box, this cream claims to provide 7 benefits for younger, healthier looking skin in 4 weeks. The most intriguing for me were visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles, evens skin tone appearance, minimizes the look of pores, and of course replenishes moisture. Extra listed bonuses is that is is oil free which is a must for acne prone skin like mine. I have been using this moisturizer every night for 3 weeks so far and my skin is thanking me. The cream absorbs quickly into my skin for a non greasy feel and my skin has never been softer. I have noticed maybe a small amount of smoothing in the wrinkles on my forehead but honestly not a huge amount. I have however noticed a more significant change in my skin tone which has evened out quite a bit, and a small reduction in the appearance of my pores (which were quite large in appearance beforehand). The bottle dispenses the perfect amount of product every time which minimizes wasted product and amazingly my skin has not been breaking out as bad since I have been using this moisturizer. My only real complaint is that it has no SPF protection which is why I have only been using it as a night cream. I will continue to use this moisturizer in the evenings and am excited to see what kind of results I can get over time! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and it works great. It smells lovely, very light and clean. It makes my skin feel incredible! I had a small break out after the first day, but it cleared right up and has remained clear since! I'll definitely be purchasing a full size one of these in the not-so-distant future! Thanks Olay BzzAgent This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer Review Not quite sure if it was this product or just a bad diet in general, got a zit while using this. other then that, it went on nice, easy to absorb, i think it did shink a pore or two and didn't go on greasy. I liked it This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Young getting younger I am a 34 year old woman, not many wrikkles but my pores a relatively visible. I have found the Total Effect 7 to be of good quality, you can notice just by how little you need to do the whole face. It's absorbed very fast, which I love. The smell is OK, not bad, but not a feature it self. As for the using it , I did notice my skin look a lot brighter and my pores shrank This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Nothing to complain I tend to be a person who loves complaining. This product totally zipped me up. I love the product alot just like its other lines - facial scrub. It minimized some of the wrinkles I have around my eyes and cheeks. It is a great product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"I feel younger already I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 for just over a week now! Having been a Clinque fan for years I might have already switched my routine to include this anti-aging moisturizer! Non-greasy, low scent and even coverage! My skin is softer, no break outs or blemishes and the sun spots are evening out with the rest of my skin tone! Love this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
olay total effects very nice light fragrance and a good texture when applying to your face feels very light and smooth. I do not know about anti-aging that I could not tell any difference. Very nice to use though. Would buy this product if not too expensive. The Olay moisturizers are always a good choice for face care ecspecially the ones with spf in them. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT SINCE I STARTED USING THIS CREAM, THE SKIN ON MY FACE IS SO SOFT AND IT SHINES. I AM SO GLAD THAT I FOUND THIS PRODUCT.I AVE NEVER HAD ANY IRRITATION WITH THIS CREAM. I RECOMMEND THIS CREAM TO EVERYONE. OIL OF OLAY HAS SO MANY PRODUCTS THAT I USE AND IT IS A NAME THAT CAN BE TRUSTED. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love it already! It's here and the results are great after 2 uses! Olay is a trusted brand but I haven't really tried it until now and I'm sold. My skin feels smoother (mosturized ) it looks brighter and it doesn't have a greasy feel either. I do have a couple small age spots that I'm watching over the next few weeks to see if they reduce in size. Overall. ..I love it! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Good Age Skin Product This is a good skin product to use for aging skin. While I didn't see significant improvements in wrinkles or sagging skin, it does smooth and moisturizes your skin so that it feels soft and supple. It also matched my skin colour so it did reduce dark colour spots and big pores. I think you have to use it longer consistently to see improved results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Nice Balanced Moisturiser I have combination skin. That awful oily T-zone with dry cheeks. This moisturiser gave me balanced nourishment without causing me to break out. It went on silky smooth and did not make me feel oily or shiny. The smell was really neutral and pleasant (I really can't handle a strong odour for facial creams). I would definitely use this one again! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"45 is the new 35! I've been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a couple of weeks now and I love the difference I see in me. Usually I look worn out and tired but since I started using this Moisturizer every night before bed I look vibrant and awake. It goes on smooth, easy to use and my skin loves it. I look 10 years younger. Thanks Olay! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Soothing comfort I've been using the olay total effects for a few weeks, and it has been soothing to my winter skin. It's soo dry but it has helped sooth the dryness that comes with winter. Ok, but not noticing any other difference. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great product This product definitely keep promises. It is hydrating for the whole day, not greasy, the skin absorb it right away and feel so comfortable after that, the smell and freshness are just great! I used it morning and night for best result. Finally, I definitely recommend Olay Total Effects as a safe solution for all the sensitive and fragile skin like mine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I think I see a difference! I am always a bit skepticle when it comes to wrinkle creams. I feel like if you don't spend a fortune then don't bother. So I am a bit surprised at the effects I see from Olay Total Effects. My skin feels smoother, and looks smoother. It even looks brighter and more even. I have one age spot and it has been minimized. I will definitely become a regular user! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Ms jolea24 I tried other anti-aging moisturizers but Olay has come through as the winner. After only a few weeks of use, I saw a noticeable difference! This is a great moisturizer from Olay! It's not too greasy, it really sinks into the skin when you put it on. It's Fragrance Free, which is so important for facial products. This is my favorite Olay Moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay and softer skin! I received a sample of Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer cream. The cream had a nice smell and a little went a long way. After the first use my face felt moisturized and softer. It absorbed nicely and didn't feel greasy. However I don't think I looked 10 years younger. As far as a moisturizer goes I would rate this as one of my favourites. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Okay, but don't use too much! I have an oily T-zone and have seen a slight improvement, but I've only been using the product for about a week. Maybe after the 4 weeks there'll be more. A tip for those with similar oily areas, use only half a pump not a whole one. Using a whole pump seems to make my face extremely oily! Will definitely keep using it and hopefully see more improvement in my skin! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Regenerist Deep Moisturizing Cream I have had very dry skin for a very long time. Since using this moisturizing cream, my skin is so moist and allows my foundation to go on so smoothly and easily! I would definitely recommend this moisturizing cream for anyone who has dry skin because of menopause or just in general. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I will continue to use this cream Since I started using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I have noticed that my skin tone has evened out. I think that I will be purchasing this cream and continue to use it. It does not irritate my sensitive skin, and it absorbs nicely. I also like that it does not leave my skin feeling greasy, which is important for my combination skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"It does make a difference this product offers moisturizing properties it's super hydrating and none greesy. I use this on my neck also and the results are great!! The texture of my skin has improved, the dryness before was starting to make me look aged. Now by using this cream daily my skin look smooth, supple, fine lines are reduced. So Olay total effects is a very good cream. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Smooth skin I love the way this product makes my skin feel. I believe that some of my fine lines are less noticeable in the short time I have been using this product. My skin does not feel greasy or slippery just more smooth and there is not an over abundance of smell associated with this product. Nothing more annoying than a bunch of beauty products introducing extra scents. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Anti aging power Recently I've been using Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer and i have to say that the new vitamin enriched formula is an dazzling sensation, not only does it make your skin younger and fresh but smooth and creamy as well! The new trial size formula is a wonderful way to start the new year off looking beautiful, stunning and exquisite. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great Product I think this product provides results and is a great skin care product. I saw my fine lines smoothed away after a few weeks. My skin looked brighter and felt refreshed. The scent was light and clean and I would truly use this product in my everyday beauty regimen. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"It's growing on me... The more I use this product, the more I like it. It is light, which is of primary importance to me as I have combination skin. It is frustratingly dry but if I put cream on it, I break out. I have terrible winter skin. I just had to go to see my doctor to get some taro-clobetasol cream in order to combine a spreading rash on my neck. This product does not burn or interfere with my medication. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Softer feeling skin with Olay Total Effects What more could one ask for in a moisturizer! It worked. The fact also that it did not break me out nor cause me a skin rash is a huge selling point for my sensitive skin. I'm still using the moisturizers , looking forward to uncovering even more benefits! :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Moisturizes well I'm loving how soft my skin is now that I've been using Olay total effects 7 in 1 for a few weeks. I haven't seen any improvement in my dark spots or wrinkles, but my skin is moisturized all day from applying it once in the morning. I'm happy with those results.

"15 days in Olay Total effects i am now 15 days in and still liking it a lot it has improved the texture of my skin, made it smoother.

This product is great. This product does what it says it will do I have used it for six months.I will continue to use it.
"Bright, moisturized healthy looking skin I've used Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer every morning for over a month. At first I didn't think I noticed any effects. It was my husband who pointed out I looked brighter and younger. This moisturizer is light feeling and a little was all I needed. My skin looks hydrated, healthy and young. If the price is right I will definitely try the version with sunscreen. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great product but find the fragrance too strong I think this product delivers on all of it's claims. My skin looks younger, brighter, the tone is more even, and I notice less fine lines. Personally I don't care for the fragrance, I find it too strong. However, I would still recommend this product to family amd friends who are looking to improve their skin! This product would get a 5 out of 5 from me if the fragrance wasn't as strong. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good product I have been using this product for a few days now and if you're looking for a product that evens skin tone appearance, this one is a good one. It's fragrance-free, which is a big plus for me. I will continue to use this product, I recommend it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great daily moisturizer This is a great daily moisturizer! I saw difference in my skin after just a few weeks! My skin is much more hydrated, even and much more firm. It absolutely dose what it says. My only major problem with the total effects line is that there isn't enough SPF!! So I still need to put sunscreen on with my moisturizer. Please Olay make a total effects moisturizer with SPF 30!!! Please."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer FTW! so, I've always used Olay products on my face, so I was excited to try this. I found that even with my combination skin (very dry forehead) I could use this all over, I didn't have to switch to something else for the extra dry areas. The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is I'd like to have an unscented option, but I'm still going to use the rest of my sample! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Amazing results THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT, i USED IT EVERYDAY AND ENJOY THE LOOK OF MY SKIN, EVEN MY HUSBAND NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE, I WOULD GIVE IT A 4.5/5 THE CREAM IS SOFT AND EASY TO APPLY, AND LEAVE NO LINES ON THE SKINS AFTER APPLICATION. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great product Olay is a product my family as been using for years. I'm soon going to b in my 30s so a aging moisturizer is something that is very important to me. I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I already feel a difference. It doesn't dry out my face like some moisturizers. You can see the difference it's made in my skin already. This is a product I will continue to buy. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love it, except... I love the olay total effects 7 in 1. It leaves my skin feeling soft, and i really notice a difference when I use it. My only concern is the smell... I find it has a very strong scent that I am not keen on. Maybe olay can release a non-scented one. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not just for anti-aging I have skin that alternates between very dry and super acne prone, so finding a moisturizer that hydrates without causing break-outs is a hassle. Olay 7 in 1 works really well for keeping my skin hydrated with the added bonus of evening out my skin tone. The one drawback to this product is that as soon as I stop using it every night, my dry skin returns within a day or two. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good product I don't look 10 years younger and not sure it holds up to all its promises but it does hydrate very well and my skin feels great. I put it on every night before going to bed. I have had 2 acnea outbursts since I started using this product, I hope it didn't cause them. I would consider buying it in the future because it provides good hydratation and I really need that in winter. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great moisturizer ! I love this product ! ...it's super hydrating, not greasy and love how my skin absorbs it ! I use it both morning and night.

I always have an extra bottle on hand This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Nourishment for your face My skin has been so dry from the crazy weather we have been having. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer makes your face feel wonderful after applying it. Your face feels so nourished and soft. And after using this product I saw a dramatic decrease in the size of my pores and my skin just plain seemed brighter and clearer. It doesn't go on greasy and absorbs right in. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

Try to anti-aging cream Olay Negative aspects: The very fragrant smell of the product. I'm used to a cream that feels slightly! Positive aspects : No need for a large quantity to the face and neck!

"Total Effects I got the opportunity to try the Oil if Olay Total Effects and I really liked it. It's a little bit thicker than I'm used to in a facial moisturizer but it really stands up to the Oil of Olay name. Great product, but pricey This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay does it all I tried the Olay Total Effects and I found that my skin felt moisturized and smooth. I remember using the basic Olay as a teenager and stopped using it as my skin changed and aged. This product seems to fit my current skincare needs and I would buy it in the future. It has a good texture and is thick (great for nighttime) but not greasy). Great value for performance!

Would definetly buy Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 At first I didn't see a big difference but after a few days I noticed that my skin tone seemed to be balancing out. My skin seemed smoother and it just felt softer. I love that the cream is smooth and has a satiny finish as I can apply my makeup right after I've used the Olay Total Effects! I think that this product is terrific and will definetly be buying this once it's on the shelf in February. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay total effects 7 Just got my bzzkit in the mail, and have to say from the first try I'm super excited for this face cream. It's not greasy and doesn't have a strong smell which I love.

Also am loving that it has 7 benefits for younger skin, great for dry winter months! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Total Effects I was given this product to sample. When I got it, I was with my mom. We both tried it out. (I think she was hoping i would give it to her). We both like how easy and smooth the product went off. I also really liked that it didn't leave my face feeling like I needed to add more, as often my face can be left feeling dry. My mom said this will be a product she will be purchasing in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Antiaging Moisturizer review I got to try the trial sized version of this for free from Bzz Agent.

"Comfortable I had never tried Olay products before even if I knew the excellent brand reputation. I was really looking forward to start trying the total effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging moisturizer. I have been using it every day since I received it and I liked it. My skin feels comfortable, it is not oily so I can apply my make-up right after moisturizing my face. I also noticed that my dark spot has faded a bit. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smoother and Wrinkle Free Skin Since using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I've noticed a significant change in my skin's moisture content and the number of wrinkles I see on my face these days! I love the product! Most of my wrinkles have smoothed over. The cream doesn't feel heavy or contain a strong smell. I use it right after I cleanse my face in the morning to give it a fresh and moisturized look and feel. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Really enjoying I really enjoy this anti-aging cream. I have been using this before I go to bed and have noticed a change in my skin. I really like how this has a pump, as opposed to having to dig the cream out. It is very sanitary to have a pump. I will be repurchasing this. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Silly smooth I love the way my face feels after applying this cream. It's not heavy but still does a great job moisturizing my skin. I didn't notice any difference in my pores or fine lines unfortunately. But I would use this product again. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
There WAS a visible difference Holidays are always hectic and stressful leaving me with very little sleep and poor eating habits. So I was really surprised to get compliments on how 'young' I was looking from friends and family that I hadn't seen in a while. What was I doing differently... I can only say the moisturizing with Olay Total Effects. Once the sample runs out I will definitely buy it again! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great Product! I was very surprised that I liked this cream as much as I did. My skin is VERY sensitive but the Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 moisturizer feels wonderful on my skin and I've had no allergic reactions. My skin feels soft and well moisturized but not overly greasy. I would highly recommend this product. I was given a free sample but I am going to purchase this for sure in the future! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Packaging problems I like Olay Total Effects moisturizer. It blends well with my natural skin tone and has helped the overall appearance of my skin. The problem is the packaging. Sometimes it blobs out and there is no way to put it back. There is no way of telling that it is almost gone and there is no warning that you are running low. So, this morning, I'll be going to work with no foundation."
"Smooth skin I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 cream now every night now for a couple of weeks. I love it! I can really see a difference in the smoothness of my skin. It looks younger to me, and my lines and age spots seem more diminished. I love that it doesn't leave my skin greasy. Overall I'm very impressed with how my skin looks using this product. Thanks Olay! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great for dry skin I especially like using Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream in the winter because the once the furnace is on the heat really dries out my skin. I use this cream in the morning and before I go to bed and it does really help hydrate my face without feeling heavy or greasy. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Visibly smooth skin This product left my face visibly and touchable smoother after the first application. I have not noticed a difference in the appearance of lines spots or wrinkles though. The only negative for me is the scent and how extremely powerful it is. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"A Total Pick-Me-Up! Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 claims to help fight seven signs of aging, and after using the product for several weeks, here is what I know to be true for me 1.Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles... I do see a difference in the fine lines on my face, but I don't know that I had enough pronounced wrinkles to start with to say I notice a difference there. 2.Evens skin tone appearance... absolutely yes, yes, yes! My skin tone is much for even and smooth looking. 3.Enhances brightness... I don't know that I can say my skin has brightened, but refer to 2! 4.Minimizes the look of pores... this is another area where I have noticed a difference as well. I don't notice my pores at all without really looking. 5.Visibly reduces age spots... yes, and I think this comes with the improved skin tone as well. 6.Restores firmness... I don't notice a change here. 7.Replenishes moisture... very much so. I notice this on my forehead area. Given that we are not all equal when it comes to our skin, the very idea that I noticed such a difference in my skins tone and moisture is enough for me to recommend trying out this product for yourself. I think 4 weeks is a fair estimate of when you should be noticing results as well. It has a few days shy of 4 weeks for me, and it's really been this last week that I've looked in the mirror and seen a difference. I've tried a few different creams, some more expensive and some less, and I feel that this cream is worth the cost to try it out and judge for yourself. Having my skin look and feel better has been a total pick-me-up, and hopefully it will be for you too! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice new product This product was nice. It went on smooth and had a nice fragrance. It didn't irritate my sensitive skin, so that is a bonus. I have been using it for a couple of weeks, although being a nice product, I have not noticed any significant benefits. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My skin has never looked better I can't believe how great my skin looks, I was skeptical of this product but after using it for just a week, I definately see smoother more even skin tone. My pores are smaller and my skin looks more even. I didn't really have many wrinkles (yet) but my biggest issue was uneven skin tone. This cream is a bit expensive, but the results are worth it. What a great skin product, thanks Olay!j This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Reduced rosacea Very surprised pleased that my rosacea reddness has been reduced significantly. Pleasant, light fragrance, got rid of sandpapery skin on jawline forehead. Unfortunately, this product contains more than one endocrine disruptor/carcinogen such as parabens. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Good It's fill so good when I used day time or night time
"Olay Total Effects After using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Aging Moisturizer for about a week, I can totally see myself switching over to this brand! It goes on smooth (dont need to use a lot) and it really leaves my skin moisturized / silky almost (even the next morning). I'm using this in the evening and then my regular moisturizer in the morning. I'll write another review once the trial pkg is done...but for now, thumbs up! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great New Product Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 is the best new product I have tried in a long time. Goes on smooth. Doesn't leave my skin greasy or even worse, sticky. Makeup goes on smoothly over time. Have only used it for 2 days........so will have to report back in a few days to see the overall effect. The only downside to this product is the overly strong scent. I usually use unscented products so this seemed very strong to me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Okay Olay Effects!! Having only purchased higher end anti-aging products, I was very impressed with this drug store brand! The product is very creamy, yet light! I have combination skin and this product did not feel greasy. I used it day and night and found my skin (after returning from s sun-filled Caribbean vacation) to be smoother and more hydrated. I would recommend this to any age but top marks for the 35 over ladies! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Impresssss Got to say I was a little bit scared to try Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 anti -anging because of my very sensitive skin. At first I found that it smelled alot but after a few minutes didn't notice it anymore. To my suprise it didn't itch or burn nothing. So this is a very big plus for me . Now it's only been 3 days that I have been using it so I watching very closely the affects in the days and weeks to come :-). This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Fantastic Product I've been using this for a very long time and the best compliment I received was when someone thought my 28 year old daughter was my sister (I was 49 at the time). Everyone is always amazed that I'm as old as I am. I only use Olay products and would never consider changing!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay Total Effects 7 I really liked using Olay Total Effects 7, my face looks and feels great. This time of year I have a tough time with dry skin, but this has made a world of difference. Thank you for the opportunity to try this product, I will definitely but it when it is available in stores. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice smell and texture I just received my Olay moisturizer, yay! My first impressions are very positive. The texture is nice and it smells really good, without too much perfume. It leaves my skin really soft and smooth. I am really looking forward to see the improvements on my skin over the next few days. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I like it so far The best thing about this moisturizer is that it's gotten me back into a face wash routine, which I've been meaning to do forever... Aside from that I like that you don't need a lot to cover your entire face. It's not greasy and only has a faint (nice) smell. My skin is looking much nicer these days, no more dry patches and actually more even in general. I'd probably keep using it once the sample runs out. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Still on the fence... I've been using Olay total effect 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer for weeks now and haven't noticed any major changes in wrinkles or age spots. However I do love the way the moisturizing sinks right in and makes my skin feel smooth. There is no strong scent so it doesn't burn my eyes which is another added bonus. All in all it would definitely be a moisturizer I would buy and recommend to friends! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great moisturizer plus! I have used on and off for years Olay products. Almost 2 months of using Olay 7 in 1 Anit Aging Moisturizer, I have to say that It keeps my skin well hydrated during the day. I've seen a bit of reduction in the lines on my forehead and a bit of brightness. I'm hoping continued use I will seem more wrinkle reduction and some of the other claims but it's worth it just for the moisturizing factor. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 I recently received a sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 and I have to say that it is one of the best moisturizers that I have used in a long time. It took care of all the fine lines with the first application! My skin looked smoother and plumper that it had in quite a while. My family noticed that I appeared as though I had had 12 hours of sleep even though I think it was only 6! Thank you Oil of Olay!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love at first try Just received my Olay Total Effects 7 in 1, tried it this morning and I am really pleased with it. There is no scent, which I like, it was easy to apply and a little goes a long way. My face felt wonderful. smooth and the cream is very light feeling. Looking forward to great results This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The Total Effect Its been about 3 weeks , i've used the lotion daily and although i haven't noticed any visible changes, i like it. When applied is seamless and smooth, very light fragrance as well. But the one drawback is that i have had a small breakout on my forehead and cheek. Other then that id recommend it but i will not be purchasing it in the future, i will stick with my tried and true Aveeno, daily moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A noticeable difference! I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has help smooth out some of my wrinkles on my forehead. Has a great scent, a little went a long way. A little heavy for me under make up as I tend to sweat but was great alone or at bedtime. I would buy. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Not heavy or greasy! The Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti Aging Moisturizer smells so good. I love the way my skin feels after I use it. It isn't heavy or sticky either. I have sensitive skin and it didn't cause any adverse reactions or make me look greasy like some moisturizers. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Just Amazing!!!! Using this product for a long WONDERFUL time. I am 73yrs old and everyone always admires the fresh Look of my skin. Just amazes me how quickly this product improves the texture of my facial skin. It also has a silky and very light feeling when applying it everyday beneath my makeup.
"One week in and love it! This stuff goes on like velvet, absorbs right into your skin, and smells amazing. I haven't used it long enough to know if it will help with my annoying age spot, but I love the ritual of putting it on. Doesn't feel greasy but feels so nourishing. I'll check back in next week! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay multi tool I think this product has minimal effort, good results, but I think longer term use is required for significant ones. And I still feel the serums are less irritating to my very sensitive skin, so began using once per day instead of both am and pm. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturiser was a nice lightweight lotion easily used under makeup. Hydrating and not greasy or oily.

"Olay Total Effects, feeling good I really like the Olay total effects anti aging moisturizer, I like the way it feels, very smooth, non greasy, absorbs beautifully and with no scent. I have a little age spot by my eye and it does seem to be lightening since I have been using the moisturizer. I can see a bit of difference so far on the fine lines around my eyes so that makes me happy! I would for sure recommend this to others. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer This is a very good product. I saw a difference just in the few days that I've used it. I have ultra sensitive skin and the only thing that I noticed was that I had a slight reddening and burning, which I'm thankful to say that wasn't as bad as with other products that I have used in the past. My skin was smoother and bit plumper looking than before I used it. I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Awesome lotion I think this product was great it was not thick like some ant ageing lotions I have tried It goes on evenly no greasy face afterwards. My skin feel firmer and radiant. I would highly recommend this produce for people with uneven skin tones cause it did wonders on my skin. Awesome product This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Finally got it At first I didn't think this product was going to work at all, so that night I did my bed time routine but instead of using my normal lotion I used the olay total effects and absolutely loved it, my face was soft and not dry for once, I would definitely recommend this product to everyone This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love Olay and love this product I have been using Olay products since I was in my 20s and I'm now almost 50. I get told over and over again how young I look and although I have good genes, I truly believe using Olay Total Effects Daily Face Moisturizer and the other Olay products has kept my skin looking the youngest it can possibly look. This is a great product and makes my skin feel moisturized and soft. I would recommend it to anyone. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Feels great. a little too scented but a product I will use I have been using a sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the past few weeks and want to let you know what I think of it. First I am a Olay fan. My mom used Olay when I was growing up and she had great skin. I didn't inherit her great skin so I have been using skin care products for as long as I can remember and over the years Olay has been one of them. I haven't used it for a while, I admit I have been seduced by the ads and claims to overnight beauty so I was happy to have the opportunity to check this product out. I love the feeling of this product it is creamy and moussey. It goes on smoothly and blends in quickly leaving no greasy feel or any sort of residue. I'm 52 and because I regularly use moisturizer I don't have many lines so I really didn't see any change there. I haven't noticed any real change in my freckles (aka age spots) or the rosacea that I suffer from. I did break out a bit when I first started using it but I don't know if that was from the product or just me - I'm prone to breakouts. I did find the scent of this product a bit strong when I first used it but have gotten used to it so it doesn't bother me but they do have a non-scented version that I would choose in the future. This moisturizer goes a long way. You don't need to use a lot to feel the benefits. It makes your skin feel soft, pliable and smooth. It is reasonably priced and does as good a job as the more expensive products I have used. I would definitely buy Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer but I would choose the non-scented version. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great anti-aging, not the best mosturizer I sure wish this product came out a long time ago, because I have tried several and having sensitive skin, I usually break out. But the total effects anti-aging, is fabulous, my skins feels so good and not once did I have any problems. I do have very dry skin and I found that it could use a slightly heavier moisturizer in the cream but other than that I love the stuff! Would recommend to anyone with regular or oily skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Total Effects I have noticed more radiant and healthier looking skin after using Olay Total Effects. The lines on my face and near my eyes are not so visible as before. My face and neck look more healthier and my skin tone looks more radiant than before. I was skeptical at first but you have to try Olay Total Effects for yourself to see the benefits of the vitamin complexes used to help your skin look more younger and more appealing.

"This cream really replenishes moisture I used Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating cream for three weeks and I already felt a significant difference in my skin. It flt softer, smoother and better hydrated. Within weeks my fine lines were less noticeable. This is an awesome product that I would highly recommend. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Excellent Moisturizer At first it felt a bit greasy when I applied it on my face, but the product gets easily absorbed, leaving skin feeling supple and well moisturized. I could see that my skin visibly appear brighter. The smell is pleasant. The moisturizing effect lasted throughout the night and my skin feels great in the morning. I am usually not a big fan of play products but I definitely wouldn't mind purchasing it for myself or others. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I noticed a difference My skin is very sensitive, and I'm always worried about trying new moisturizers, but Olay has always been a trusted brand, so I was happy to try it out. I've only been using the product for about a week, but I've noticed a difference in how soft my skin is. I also noticed that my cheeks and forehead which are usually reddish - were not as bright as they normally are. So I'm thinking it's evening out my skin tone as well. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My Olay experience I actually liked the feeling of it once it was applied. Not greasy and easy to apply. I have combination skin, so certain parts of my face are very dry while others are very oily and acne prone, so if you're like me you may actually like this product. I didn't notice it making a drastic change so far though. Maybe it takes a bit more time for some. I'd want to know how well this works for combination skin before I buy it.

great facial cream I got this product ax a sample to try and I'm being using it for about 2 weeks now. The play total effect 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer left my face feeling smooth and fresh..I applied this facial cream in the morning and it's good all day long. The scent is pleasent too not too strong at all...once my sample is finished I'll buy the full.one for sure. I was always a fan of okay but this cream Is really good.thank you This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Feeling a little firmer I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer lives up to its promise of making skin feel firmer. I use facial moisturizers all the time and noticed a difference in my skin's firmness using this product, more so than the comparable brands I have tried in the past. I believe the unique vitamin complex contributed to making my skin feel younger, evening out my skin tone and reducing the look of fine lines. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great moisturizer I thought Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 moisturizer worked really well keeping my skin soft and moisturized. Over my duration of use I noticed a reduction in the fine lines and uneven skin tone on my face. I do have sensitive skin and my face had no negative reaction to the cream. My only issue with the cream and my reasoning for giving 4 stars was the scent was quite strong and I do prefer scent free products. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Very nice! I was so excited to receive the Oil of Play Total Effects sample and I was not disappointed. The cream feels luxurious, has a very nice mild scent and absorbs quickly. I felt like I was really pampering myself. So far after using the product daily for 5 days I have noticed that my skin tone appears more even, my skin looks smoother and it's not as dry as it usually is at this time of year. So far, total thumbs up!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Soft and smooth A great 7 in one cream from Olay! I loved the way it soaked into my skin. Not leaving it feeling dry or stiff. I took this product on vacation the first week of December and continue to use it now. I feel great (and my skin does too!) about using this cream by Olay!!! :) This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"It's a great moisturizer I have combination skin with the cheeks being quiet dry. I need a nourishing moisturizer and was happy to try this product. Firstly, it was a great moisturizer. It was easily absorbed by my skin and I was able to put my make up on right away. My skin felt firmer, even after the first use. After using it a few weeks, I found my skin tone was more even and brighter. I would recommend Olay Total Effects! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
A great moisturizer that really works I have been using Regenerist Deep Hydration Cream for years because I love it! I have tried over 6 different high end moisturizer's and always go back to this product because it works and hydrates my skin. Plain and simple this Cream rocks my world and I will always use it!

"Noticeable Difference I have been using this Olay product for almost 2 weeks and I have seen a noticeable difference in crows feet and other wrinkles, and the texture and tone of my skin. It feels smoother and softer, and I only had to apply it once a day. No time consuming routine, just real results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Slaughtered the eye wrinkles I actually took this campaign because I wanted to reduce a dark spot on my cheek which it hasn't done but....it killed the wrinkles around my eyes. I am not concerned about them but I have totally noticed a huge difference!! These pictures are take a week apart from each other. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Gentle and smooth The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a beautiful moisturizer. The scent is light and pleasant. It is moisturizing without being heavy. The pump dispenses the perfect amount of cream and my skin feels fresh and clean after application. It's a great product to help with the effects of aging. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"my beautifuk skin I found this product so effective. I wanted to reduce fine lines, and it helped me to look smooth and line free. I was surprised at the silky softness and the way I felt after..something I will try again and again. Feeling beautiful is easy with Olay 7 in one. My skin glows, nothing to show but clean This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good Face Cream I enjoyed using Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and it did not irritate it at all. It was light while still moisturizing. My skin tends to get really dry in the winter months and i found that this did the trick without being too heavy. I didn't notice a great difference in some of the fine line on my face, but that could be because it was not a full size bottle. Would recommend to others!

"Anti Aging I have to say, I have really enjoyed this product. This is the first time I have used an Olay product. I feel very confident in saying I will continue to use this product. My skin feels softy, healthier and I don't find it a hassel to use. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking to take care of their skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effect 7 days Pretty good product. Most product still kept my skin dry at time, but with Total effect 7 days, it stayed moisturized and not dry. I've notice that my face looks more refreshed. The fine lines on my face of decreased also. My husband even said I look refreshed these days. I would recommend this product to anyone. Even if you don't have signs of aging, it's great to use on a regular basis, so you stay looking young, no matter what age. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Lovely product I really liked using the Olay Total Effects moisturizer. I was so glad that it had a light sheer feel on my face. It wasn't greasy or heavy at all. I think I would prefer an unscented version though. I took the sample away with me on vacation. With all the sun I soaked up, this moisturizer kept my skin smooth and fresh. I really think it has smoothed out the tiny lines at the corner of my eyes too! Yay - speaking as a 52 year old! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Smooth and silky My mother stole my Olay Total Effects. She said I will let you know how it is. Well.......She has said that it has been the best anti-aging product she has used. She LOVES that it goes on smooth and the smell is great. Her only bad review about it was that it wasn't in a HUGE bottle that she could bath in. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Effective Moisturizer for Anti-Aging I think my skin looked so much better after using the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I slowly but surely noticed an even skin tone appearance, enhanced brightness, minimized look of pores, and replenished moisture on my skin. This is an amazing moisturizer for aging skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Best mosteriser The product no only smells good it feels good it even healed my face acne scars
"Olay at its Best I'm very excited to get invited to the Bzz Campaign for Olay Effects. I have used it in the past and it works great. Not greasy, no leftover residue. If you have sensitive skin like me, though, you may prefer the unscented version as there is scent in the sample we received. Other than that, it works great and I can see a difference in fine lines/winkles since I started using it in the last year. Would recommend. Great product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Real Results I, and other people, have noticed a change in my skin. The pores are less visible and so are the lines. My skin is brighter and much more even in tone. I have not noticed the reduction in age spots yet, but it hasn't been very long. The results are really visible and I have bought the regular size Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. The trial size is available in February and will go in my travel bag. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Improving skin My skin is definitely on its way to moving on up. With a usually uneven skin tone, it has been a pleasant surprise to see that things are looking more even and brighter. Fine lines also seem to be improving because of the unique vitamin complex that has been introduced to it recently. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Brand new skin I think this has been a very successful trial for me, I love using Olay Total Effects moisturizer! The lines around my eyes and mouth are diminished and I feel I have a more even skin tone. My skin feels moisturized and looks brighter, younger. Who doesn't want that! I love the way my skins feels after I clean and then apply Total Effects, it just feels and looks wonderful. Thanks for turning me onto this product!

"Great Moisturizer! I think since using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-Aging Moisturizer my skin feels softer and fine lines are less visible, plus it is a great moisturizer under my make-up. I would definitely recommend it to women who are looking for a effective skin-care product at a reasonable price. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So far so good! I just started using olay total effects daily, and I am impressed that as soon as my first application my face has felt smoother and softer, I have high hopes for this product now! The smell is better than most face products and it is so easy to apply! Very impressed and hope it keeps up with its word . This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So far so good I am really enjoying the Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti ageing moisturizer. It's silky smooth and smells nice. I have yet to really notice whether or not the anti ageing properties are working yet as its only been 2 weeks. However, I do know that my skin feels smooth and healthy. Only more time will tell!

Great for winter I think that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is just what I was looking for in winter moisturizer! It is a nice thick moisturizer but when applied goes on quite well. I find that it is very moisturizing and wonderful feeling on my dry skin. I have noticed that it helps to even out the redness in my skin as well. I am not sure how it would work in the summer but since I live in Canada... not much of an issue :) This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great skin product! I have to say I wasn't too sure what to expect with this product, since I usually don't use anti-aging products. However, this moisturizer leaves a clean feel and it is not greasy which is really surprising. It also improves skin texture, and you feel it after one week or so depending on your skin type. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love this product I love the smell of this product, it's thickness and how my skin doesn't feel greasy. It's hard to tell its anti-aging effects, the only thing I miss is an SPF. For that reason I will not wear it during the day, and only use it at night but that's fine. I gave it four stars for its lack of SPF. I will buy this product again. I have not used Oil of Olay products in a while since I felt they dried my skin but not this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great This product is good and also it has made my roseacea better
"Feels like heaven... This cream feels amazing when it is applied! It actually does a fantastic job at moisturizing my dry skin. The pump was hard to get moving initially, but it's way better than a screw off lid. No mess, no extra product. The cream smells great too! I can't wait to see how my skin will look in a few weeks time. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good Moisturizer I like this as a moisturizer. It absorbs well and doesn't leave my skin sticky. As for the fine lines, age spots and skin tone I don't notice anything different. But I don't feel that a couple of weeks if a fair time to assess those kinds of changes. I don't see big changes as promised but I won't take off stars because I haven't been using the product long enough to make a fair judgement. For now, it a great moisturizer.

"Will purchase in the future I am loving this moisturizer. I have very dry skin and rosecea. Not the best skin combo. I love how light this formula is, it isn't thick or oily. It has helped the lines around my eyes. It also keeps my face moisturized for hours. I do not have to reapply and reapply. i will purchase in the future.

"Looking good I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for weeks now and have noticed a change in my skins appearance. My skin is brighter,softer and smoother than before. I have noticed a reduction in fine lines on my face. I recently had someone guess my age as 25 and I'm 33. So its working for me I think. The product absorbed quickly and doesn't have a strong scent that a lot of face moisturizers have. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smoothest Cream I love the feel of putting on this cream. It is so velvety!! I really look forward to putting it on. My skin feels moisturized all day, but never feels greasy. I feel like I'm getting an intensive moisturizing experience, especially important for me in the winter. Although I usually prefer fragrance-free products, I actually liked the soft scent as well. My skin appears brighter and definitely has a more even tone. LOVE IT! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Soft and silky I love this product a lot. It moisturizes, minimizes pores, has SPF, evens out your skin, prevents wrinkles and more. One thing is that it does smell like sunscreen but it's barely noticeable. My skin is oily combination so greasy moisturizers are a no for me, but this one is light and not greasy at all. Everyone is different so results will be different, but I definitely recommend this product and I am definitely repurchasing This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Total Effects Bzz I've been using it for almost a month and did noticed some improvements in my face. It is moisturizing but without that greasy feeling that's usually apparent in night creams. I like the fact there are vitamins in it -- a somewhat new concept to me since the moisturizers I've used in the past had no such vitamins. I'm not too big with face moisturizers but I thought this Olay Total Effects went pretty well for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Terrific moisturizer I really enjoy Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 moisturizer, it goes on smooth, soaks into my skin fast and leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth. I've noticed an improvement in the glow of my skin, especially under my eyes where I tend to get dark circles. I'm 29 and want to prevent further wear of my skin, and I think this product will help a lot, as well as treat the issues I already see. The product itself feels smooth and smells refreshing.

Loving Olay! I really enjoyed the sample of Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It soaked in really quickly and wasn't greasy. It helped to even my skin tone which is great with the unique vitamin complex it has. It will help to fight the seven signs of aging. It is definitely a product I would consider buying. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
works great I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I have a really hard time with dry skin and starting to get wrinkles. After using this for a week I have already noticed a difference in how soft my skin seems to stay and my tone seems to be more even. I would definately recommend this product and will keep buying this myself. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This product produces great results. I use this product each morning immediately after getting up and washing my face. The result is immediate. In the morning my skin looks dry and tight. After smoothing on the Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream it looks moist and plump. The lines are softened and my face feels soft and moist to the touch.

"Olay is O KAY with me.... I have been using this since I received it in the mail. Looks like its working. I keep using it daily. I'm trying to see if it will help with my fine lines on my forehead and my neck. I will still keep reviewing it but am waiting to see results that I have confidence I will achieve. I will keep posting, so far so good!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effect I think it's a really good product and also that the price is good. It's good quality enough to think it's a good deal to buy it. The smell is nice and not too strong (if the smell is too strong, I can not use it), texture is smooth and the feeling of the skin right after is really comfortable. I recommande it to anyone who is looking for a good product for a cheap price. I also may buy some of it as a christmas gift for a friend of mine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Wow 7 in 1 I think Olay Total Effects is a permanent daily routine now and I'm going to keep it. I look younger. Even skin tone. Aging spots lighter or gone completely. Stress lines are looking happy. Makes you feel good that a product actually works. Got to try the product before spending money on something that may not work. It lasts so the price is worth it. Especially if it works! Thank you Bzz agent for giving me this awesome experience! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Olays New Moisturizer for Even and Balanced Skin I received a sample size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer to try for free from BzzAgent. While its difficult to say for sure how well the product works when only trying a trial size version I do like Olay's new moisturizer as its left my skin tone very even and balance particularly when using under make up. The product goes on smoothly and is not greasy nor does it make my skin oily. Smells good and seems to work well. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Olay Olay Total Effects Olay Total Effects feels really smooth going on my skin. I really do like the feel. It definitely moisturizes my skin without having that oily feeling. The good thing too is that you don't have to use much to cover your whole face. It didn't really smooth out my fine lines but I guess I need to use it for a longer period to see more results. Overall I do like this product and I will buy it to see what the longer term effects will result. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Loving this product Winter months are always very tough on my skin.. This moisturizer is great for keeping it hydrated. I'm currently pregnant and noticed more lines on my skin in the last month or so.. Which I'm sure just has to do with pregnancy. I'd like to give this another shot next year. Works even better when I exfoliate first. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturzier I think this product is very good. I am in my early 40's. I don't have a bunch of issues with my skin, so I don't usually buy this type of product. I was curious to try it though. It goes on like a light foundation/ moisturizer with a nice scent. I put it on my hand at first and let it seep into my skin. It was non-greasy and fast absorbing. After about a half hour I was surprised to feel my hand even softer than normal and the skin tone even out. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"olayfaithful I have been faithful to olay products my whole adult life ( lookin at 50 people) I have nice, not perfect but nice skin. I have never used or even considered using other products. I've always used basic age defying but recently started using total effects. I see increased smoothness. No miracles just good skin. Thanks Olay! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"anti-aging Although I have only used this product for a week, I have not really noticed any differences. My skin does feel smooth. I do not think it keeps my face moisturized all day long. I have noticed that my face gets a little dry by the end of the night. Maybe I need to use this product longer to notice any more effects of the product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Starting to see a change I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Mosturizer for one week now and I am starting to see and feel a difference. My skin seems more toned. I am starting to notice a cleaner look. There are fewer fine lines that I need to cover up with concealer. Overall, I am happy with the product. It doesn't feel heavy. There is a pleasant light odor and no residue. I really feel like I am doing something good for my face when I use the product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"love this! i use your regular olay complete daily moisturizer spf30 and your regenerist cream daily. the regenerist cream (the one in the red short bottle) feels silky smooth and very hydrating. however, i tried the total effects line recently and thought those products felt sticky on my face. will not buy those again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loving this product! I never use moisturizers or soap on my face and I have always had fairly youthful looking skin. I'm glad I was asked to participate in the Olay 7 in 1 challenge! I am loving this stuff! I am only about a week into the campaign, but I'm feeling a change to my skin already! Looking forward to the next few weeks and the end result!

week 2 of olay total effects 7 Well not much has changed on my face this past week. Well not that I have noticed. I still really like the feel of this cream and the smell. It is an easy pump to use and does give out the right amount for your face. When I look at my face it seems not so dull. So I guess somethings have changed. By the time Christmas rolls around I'm sure hoping that 10 years have gone off my face. What a Christmas gift that would be LOL I will keep you posted.

Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti - Aging Moisturizer I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is the product i have been looking for . Just in a few days of using the trial size i noticed a difference in my fine line which is a big concern for me . Hydration in my skin was also a very comforting sign as my skin was a little dry . Yaaa i feel this product is a win in my eyes and i am going to buy the full size to continue the results that i have started by using the trial size :) !!!!!

Even skin effect I really think my skin looks healthier and more radiant after using Olay even after a short while. The way it goes on and the way my skin feels is a testimony to this product. There is no after effects of putting it on like others that leave a sticky residue. This goes on clean. Leaves an all over nice effect on your skin. It doesn't have the overly powerful smell of perfume products which you don't want in your product to begin with. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"9126774284 The best ever I couldn't have got my skin back to normal without it. Why didn't someone tell me about Olay before, I feel so late on the matter right now."
Gooooooood on my skin as thi is a Olay product and because its reputation follows it this product is just delicious. I am 37 years old and beginning to see the importance of have wrinkle and or aging products to protect my skin. The smell is great. The texture is soft and soothing. I use it everyday and i do see the difference. I have been using it for the last 2 weeks and I have nothing negative (ok maybe the price to come) to say about this product. Thanks Buzz agent !

"Great Product I used this product until the bottle was empty and went to purchase. I took several pictures along the way and noticed a visible difference around my eyes and mouth. It was hard to find and expensive however a little does go a long way. As a consumer, I would want to know the potential benefits of the product. I would also like clear instruction on the best time of day to reap the most benefit. This was not explained on the package or instructions. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loved this moisturizer! I loved this product. I have sensitive skin and eczema on my face so have to use caution with new products. This one was great, it didn't burn my face like so many do. It also smelled great and evened out my skin tone fairly well for the short time the sample lasted me. I'm still relatively young but my face is definitely starting to show signs of age... Would definitely be interested in purchasing for longer term use to see the full results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So far so awesome! I am impressed with the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer after only a few uses so far. It goes on smooth, and has a scent that isn't too strong. If I were considering buying this product, I would want to ensure that it does what it claims to do. The product has already made my skin softer and has evened out my skin tone. Way to go, Olay! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Total Effects while I cant speak to the claim that it will make you look 10 years younger in 4 weeks...the trial size isn't large enough to last 4 weeks... I loved the moisturizer. I used it day and night. I love the way it feels on my skin. it is luxuriously smooth and nourishing without being heavy or greasy. It soaks in nicely and is great under my make up during the day. I guess I will have to buy the full size product to really test out the age-rewind properties. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Its good Its good cause it works and that's all that matters. .
it's really good It's really good because it helped me alot with my skin. It's really healthy now
"Smooth and silky! When I first tried this product, I found it to be non greasy, it went on smooth and made my skin feel very silky. Although this isn't the type of product I normally prefer to use (I prefer using natural products), I do like the way it makes my skin feel. I generally use 2 pumps per application and that's more than enough to do my face and neckline. While I can't speak to the results as I haven't particularly seen any yet, I do believe this is a great product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay 7 in 1 Total Effects As a person who shies away from skin products and moisturizers in general (I have sensitive skin prone to react), I was a little reluctant to try another but had heard good things. I was happy I tried it out as I have not had any breakouts and my skin is actually feeling soft. I am only just over a week in but my skin tone is looking good too. So far this one gets a solid vote for feeling on and scent as well. Hope that 10 years comes off in the next 3 weeks! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great product at a great price! I received this product as a free trail from Olay as a part of a Bzz Campaign. I've been using this product for about a week now. The moisturizer goes on smooth and the pump puts out just the right amount of moisturizer. It does feel a little thicker in my hand, but when I put it one, it doesn't feel heavy or thick at all. I think it's great for winter especially. I think for the price point, this is an excellent product that I would buy myself in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This is great for looking younger! I am not too old myself but after using this for just 1 week, I feel like i look younger and have even had people saying I look younger now. I used to have fine lines under both of my eyes and after using this for a week they have almost disappeared! I will definitely continue using this and will buy this product when it comes in stores.

"Great for uber sensitive skin I think it is a very good overall moisturizer. I have very sensitive and allergic skin, and this did not have any adverse reactions to my face, which truly surprised me. I've had lots of stress, so I don't notice change that way, like wrinkles being slightly diminished, but my skin was much softer, and hydrated, without being oily at all.

Olay 7-In-1 Moisturizer I got to try Olay 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer from BzzAgent and it going on really smooth and soaks into your skin real fast so it doesn't stay greasy and oily on your face after and it smells great just like a bar of Olay or Dove soap.

"I'm Sad That It's Almost Over! So, after using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for over a month, I have started seeing some nice results. My skin tone is even. My morning redness isn't as bad, and my face feels nice and smooth. My under eyes don't look quite as frightful as they did prior to using this moisturizer. I'm just sad that my sample is almost finished :( I wish the sample had been bigger, as now I have to wait until February before it's available again!

"Awesome skin care The moisturizer is great, its made my skin soft and my T zone has started to even out. I have a lot of freckles and I've noticed them lightening. As a busy mom I don't have a lot of time in the morning this is great. It pumps out just the right amount of moisturizer. It is light weight and the fragrance is fresh not perfumey. I will continue to use it!!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I wish there was more to try ! I've been using the sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a little over a week now. I think I might be seeing results but it's hard to say - I would of needed to try it for a month to really be certain. With the little sample I've received, I did notice my skin feeling more supple, looking less fatigued and healthy. Send me more so I can be sure that I should switch from my high-end brand to Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer ! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This product keeps my face mosisturized all day. I love using Regenerist Deep hydration Regenerating Cream. The product is priced within my budget and my skin tends to get dry. The cream isn't oily and keeps my face and neck well moisturized. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who tends to get dry skin but doesn't want an oily moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Surprisingly Light! I was surprised how light the cream is and how moisturized my skin was after. My skin felt silky smooth after every use. I was worried it would make my acne prone skin break out but this oil free formula did not make me break out and left me with smooth hydrated skin! Makin sure it was oil free was the first thing I looked into before I used this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Evens out my skin tone! Olay Total Effects 7in1 moisturizer made a difference in my complexion. I found that the unique vitamin complex improved my skin tone. My skin tone is appearing a lot more even and smooth. I found that some of my spots that I had been developing are disappearing, and fading. I am looking forward to continuing to use this product to determine its full benefits. I would also like to know a complete skin care routine to follow to get the most benefits of this product.

"Olay Total effects 7 in 1 moisturizer.. Amazing Olay total effects moisturizer is amazing! It has now become my go to brand to purchase. In only a few weeks of using it I have noticed changes in my skin. Those pesky fine lines are smoothing, my face is glowing with moisture, even a few of my dark spots have lightened. I have seen more benefits using this product than with my more expensive department store brands and at a fraction of the cost. Thank you buzz agent for introducing me to this great product!

"Soft, smooth skin! I was not sure what to expect from this product, as there are many similar products out there on the market. But after only using it only once, I noticed my skin was so soft and smooth. It did not have a strong scent either, which is good. After a few days of using this product, I noticed my pores were not as noticeable. Fine lines around my mouth seemed invisible. A must try! I really am impressed with this product. And olay is much more affordable than other brands. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"New lightweight creamy Olay face lotion I've been trying this product on a freebie trial. It's only been a few days but I'd say it does 1, 3, 4 and 7 in its claim to fame list with a quick turn around so far. I think the appearance and age spots might be a longer term result. It's more a light creamy lotion whereas I prefer the serum for my very sensitive skin as it usually irritates less. I am using after washing in the evening and under makeup in the am. We'll see how it continues... IGotItFree BzzAgent Olay This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Wonderful results! I have found that by using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, my wrinkles have become more invisible. I also got a friend to try it along with me and she had really deep wrinkles and we noticed how well it worked to make them not so deep. It didn't leave a greasy feeling on our face, that was a plus. It also has a nice scent. We are very satisfied with how well this anti-aging moisturizer works and will consider purchasing more for future use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Another Innovative Product from Olay Olay has been a staple in my beauty arsenal for as long as I can remember. As a teenager I used to buy it because it the soap smelled so wonderful. I am glad that as I have gotten older Olay has continued to provide products that match my skin's stage. The unique vitamin complex helped to fight the seven signs of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone. So now I can look like I still have young skin and be wise enough to know the secret to it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
what you need to know aboutOlay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I think that you need to know there is sunscreen in the moisturizer.You also need to know that it does lighten up dark spots .IT does make your pores appear smaller.IT does help a small bit on the fine line and wrinkles.IT does not remove redness of the pimples that it gave me .I liked the richness of the cream and it was not greasy feeling on your fingers or face.But big draw back was the 13 pimples that it gave me.So then i needed an acne cream to go with this cream.

The Best Night Cream EVER! I have been using this product for several years I have combo skin but this lotion is seriously luxurious! My skin is so smooth and soft after using it no other lotion I have tried has ever compared! My fine lines soften while using this and my skin looks flawless I hope they keep this lotion around forever! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"my new go to skin product I love the formula! Smooth, not overly scented and not oily. Goes on like a dream. Absorbs quickly and doesn't feel heavy. A perfect face cream. I also love the design of the packaging. 1-2 pumps of the lid and that's it. Don't have to dig in a jar or squeeze too much or too little. I love that! Leaves my skin feeling smooth, soft, fresh and confident! Finally a reputable brand that does what it says and then some! Everyone should try this product! You won't be let down!

"Winter Blues With the weather getting colder, my skin gets drier. I've used the last of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer sample I received over the last few days and my skin has been grateful. No more peeling, red skin. My skin is more even after four weeks and a few of my fine lines have disappeared. Age spots are still noticeable but look smoother. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Oil of Olay Total Effects Review I normally use Oil of Olay but usually buy the lesser expensive versions, simply because of cost. But this is a great, Ive been using my free trial! for a month and my skin is very soft, even in tone, but I'm not too sure about the reducing of lines though. It tingles slightly when I put it on, but not in a bad way. And, importantly, it doesn't have a chemical or perfumey smell to it. I can't stand products that smell strong, this is very nice and mild. Would recommend it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Can you see a difference I've been using my free sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging for 2 weeks now. This moisturizer absorbs quickly, leaves no irritation, is non-greasy has a very light scent. I haven't noticed my fine lines wrinkles diminishing, but my skin definitely look firmer! In all honesty, I am fairly impressed at this product - usually I stay away from the anti-aging products, thinking they are just hype - but so far I am liking Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smooth and silky I have been using my cream for three days now. My first impression is that the texture is really nice. Smooth and silky, the smell is the caracteristic smell of Olay products, it smells good. A synthetic but nice smell. I liked the product so far, my skin is hydrated, smooth, and luminous. Since I have used for three days I cannot say yet if it had any effect on my wrinkles. I have wrinkles mostly on my forehead and near my eyes. I am eager to rate the efficacity of the product !

Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I absolutely loved half this product! It was very light compared to other anti ageing moisturizers that i have tried. The texture was almost airy it was so light! Although it said it was unscented it did have a very very light scent to it that was pleasant. I used it everyday for at least a week and i enjoyed it. I did feel that it was not as moisturizing on some days where the weather and wind left my face feeling drier than usual. All in all i would purchase this product in a full size!

"This product is smooth on your skin It was great, after I used Olay my skin felt moisturizer and smooth."
"Another win for Oil of Olay It hasn't been a full four weeks yet since I started using this moisturizer, but I like what I see so far! It's another high-quality product from Oil of Olay, leaving my skin feeling really moisturized and generally healthier than before I started using it. I will be back to write more after four weeks. In the meantime, I would recommend picking up a bottle as soon as you can. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good for daily use- Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer I received the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer sample (Travel-sized) from bzzagent for free to try out and review. I shared it with a relative for around 5-6 days every morning after cleaning our faces. In my personal opinion, the sample size is perfect because it fits in to my palm and it has pump mechanism which means no twisting the cap. Nice! The fragrance is very light and nice which is good. It reminds me of baby products. The moisturizer has very light consistency so it does not feel heavy on the face. Infact, I completely forgot that my face was not bare after few seconds of application. The moisturizer has also creamy/pearly/off-white colour but it is almost transparent on the face. However, I did notice that if I applied too much, my facial tissue would stained yellowish as I wipe my face which is the only reason I took out a star. This almost transparent moisturizer does cover the uneven skin tone lightly which portrays my skin smoother and brighter. I did not see any lasting effects because I ran out of the sample as we were two people trying it. But me and my relative were sure that this one product could replace most of our routine products on daily basis. I have sensitive skin which burns, turns red and gets bumpy if I use any wrong product. But this product worked out nicely for me. I did not experience any redness or burning. And the hydration lasts so long that I do not need another application during the day. This does make my skin look healthier. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I really think this product might be the one for me from now on. I haven't used it as religiously as I should have, but the results so far are very promising. It has a pleasant scent, not overpowering and is silky smooth to the touch. It's very easy to apply and is absorbed quite quickly. It also comes in the cutest bottle ever. As it's not available yet in stores I can't say how good the value is, but Olay is generally very reasonably priced.

The bomb It's the bomb because it actually works and it smells amazing and it's very relaxing
Silky and smooth fast! Noticing tighter pores and softer skin even after just a couple days use. The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer is lightweight leaves no oily or sticky residue on my skin. The smell is strong but appealing. Very floral. My skin feels soo soft and firm. A noticeable difference in two days. A little goes a long way so im sure ill see significant results by the end of the bottle. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Impressive Anti-Aging Moisturizer First impression: I was happy it didn't make me break out! It felt nice on my skin, not heavy or greasy. I have a few fairly deep worry lines that I was paying close attention to with this product. They are not gone, but I do think I see an improvement, which is more than I expected in about a month worth of use. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is worth a shot! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great product with little packaging flaws Great product. Already had a similar product from Olay in the past. I like the texture and smell very much. My skin feels fresh and smooth afterwards. The only downside is the pump mechanism. It's not working properly and I had the same issue with the Total Effects Daily Anti-Aging UV Moisturizer Plus Touch of Foundation Cream that I used in the past. The pump get's stuck or doesn't pump. Additionally I am under the impression that half the product is still in the bottle after the pump stops working. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Pretty good but not for me. I don't think that its for my age range, but then again it's to prevent aging skin. For me it did great on evening my skin tone , as for those fine line I didn't notice a difference. The product moisturizes great and it's easy to apply, a little goes a long way. I did not like the feeling on my face after application, it felt like my skin was being stretched (maybe it's what it does). I think its a great product for someone that doesn't spend much time on makeup since it's like an all in one . This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I like the effects of total effects! I think that Olay total effects is a quality skincare product. It hydrates my skin and leaves it feeling smooth. I normally use aveeno but I really liked this Olay effects. I felt like my skin looked a bit better after about a few days it was more noticeable. It is fragrance free so good if you have sensitive skin. Going on vacation so I packed it with me and it is great that is has SPF in it. I think this is something I would use daily. Left my skin feeling soft, clean and refreshed and not oily. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A product well worth investing time money in!!! This product does exactly what it claims to Fight 7 signs of skin problem. Pros: - With regular use, results are visible within few days. - Can replace multiple products in our kit. - Has a very mild fragrance hence can be applied even during the day. - Smart packaging reduces wastage of the product. Cons: - For the price charged the quantity of product does not justify value for money. - Leaves the skin looking slightly oily shiny hence may not be suitable for people looking for mat finish.

"Good Results with Olay Total Effects I've been using this product since I received a trial sample and I have to say I like it for the most part. I notice a reduction in some fine lines and my skin is soft. The only negatives I have to report is that I find the lotion doesn't go well under makeup. Perhaps it's more for before bedtime. I'm also not a fan of the smell of the cream but I tend to be really sensitive to smells so that might be the reason. All in all, I would recommend it to people who are trying to smooth of their skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I have been using this product for several weeks now and I have to say it is a really good product with great value! I have noticed (and others have too!) that some of my fine lines have disappeared with the regular usage of this product. It works just as well as many of the more expensive creams and lotions out there. I have tried many, but this is great for the price paid. This is my new regular product and I am saving money not buying the more pricier ones. Thanks Oil of Olay!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 Really liked the Olay... the smell was great, the texture amazing, the application great, liked the short-term results in covering pores (not sure it covered fine lines)... not sure if it would help in the long-run of fine lines and pores but really did enjoy the product for the short-term results. Would definitely buy this product to try a larger sample and give it another go! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Prevent Wrinkles Now! The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a lovely nourishing cream, that will leave your skin feeling soft for hours! I really enjoyed using this product out over the past month. My skin feels and even looks firmer and brighter. The scent was a little strong at first, but I got used to it within a couple of days, and now I actually enjoy it. I may only be 30 now, but I believe this is the time to start taking care and taking some preventative action for my skin! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Excellent product! As with any Olay product you will get superior product that will moisturize your skin and also correct age issues. Do it!
"Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti Aging After getting my sample in the mail I started using it right away. The Olay Total Effects 7in1 Anti-Aging has a nice light scent and not too perfumey, but what I noticed right away was how well it blended into my skin. Most moisturizers I've tried have left behind a greasy feeling but the 7in1 left my skin feeling smooth and soft throughout the day. By the end of the first week my skin started to look brighter and more evened-out. While my only issue is the price, it is well worth it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice product! I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer very day and I enjoyed how it feels on my skin.

It has only been a few days but so far, so good. This product smells fresh, feels light weight and makes you feel great. I have also noticed that I look more awake and fresh since using it. Like my face has received a little radiance. I will continue to use it and see how it pans out. Super happy and excited with it so far!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A winter treat for my face I found that using the new Olay Total effects was very pleasant. On first impression, the package itself was recognizable, I could tell it was from Olay. The pump bottle was easy to use and non messy. The scent was nice and light. It felt light on my skin, and moisturized it right away. after a few days, my face felt smoother than usual. The only gripe I have about this product is when I wash my face after using it, my yes start to burn. I may just be sensitive to it, who knows. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Silky Smooth Skin What I know about this product so far is that it is inexpensive and comes in a trial size. Perfect for people wanting to trial without buying a full size bottle. I have just been trialing this for a short time but so far I am experiencing silky smooth skin. I look forward to the Anti-aging results. My skin no longer has the dry patches I usually get in the winter time. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Aging with Total Effects It is has been a wonderful experience to use an anti-aging product on my skin that works. Olay Total Effects comes in a container that allows you to apply the appropriate amount for your face. When applying, the lotion goes on very smooth and leaves my skin feeling very hydrated. I have notice that my skin tone and brightness is considerably better along with an improvement in firmness. If you have aging skin you definitely want to add Olay total Effects to your beauty routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Impressed! I wasn't sure about Oil of Olay products... the last time I used them ages ago I wasn't terribly impressed, but WOW! This changed my mind. With consistent use, I saw results. Noticeable results. I don't have many wrinkles, but I have one on my forehead that definitely lessened with consistent use. This product is definitely on my anti-aging radar!

"Really good, but I can't rate how effective it really is overall I was really happy to be able to try Olay Total Effects, and I've liked it a lot. To be honest, I haven't really noticed a difference in my skins appearance, but that could just be because I have young looking skin to start with. This is a very nice moisturizer though, it has a nice light scent, it feels nice and smooth on the skin, absorbs fast, leaving my face shine free. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I have used Olay products since 1960. I have used Olay products since 1960, and everyone says I look 15 years younger than my age! I highly recommend Olay products to all of my friends. I have tried other products, but Olay works best for me. I will continue to use Olay forever! Thank you, Olay, for giving me beautiful, flawless skin!

"Nice Glow Olay This face moisturizer is fantastic! I regularly use the original olay cream as a daily moisturizer so I was curious to try this product and see how it compared. It has a smooth silky texture and great smell. It also gives an overall glow to your face that the regular olay doesn't. While it may be too light for the winter, it is perfect for summer wear as it is light and protects your skin! I would recommend this product for people with oily skin or who like a light, weightless moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I have used Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for more than 21 days. I can tell you its absolutely creamy and smooth to apply. Not much of scent too which I Looove. My face feels soft and smooth. I use it twice a day on my face and neck. I always look out for SPF, type of skin use and whether it has any scent before buying any products. Except for SPF, everything fits the bill Rating 9/10.... since no SPF :( Will I buy this again : Yes Yes and Yes Would I recommend this to anyone : Absolutely This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love the product I have tried it for awhile now. I have to say I love how it makes my skin feel after I put on my face. I have very dry skin and my face feels so soft after I put it on. The only thing I would have to say is the scent of the cream is a little strong when first put on but does seem to fade after short bit. Other then the scent it works great. My skin is smooth and feels soft and looks better then ever This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Soothes dry skin - just wish it didn't feel so much like chemicals I really love putting on this cream. I put it on right when I get out of the shower, to keep my skin from drying out before putting on my makeup. I have fairly sensitive skin, but it's not bothered by it at all - even around my eyes. My skin feels smoother and less tired because of it. I do always wish things were made with more natural ingredients - especially because I'm a mom of a toddler who is always touching my face, putting his hands in his mouth, etc. Even the smell could be a little more 'natural' This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer Growing up I've always used Olay for my face wash and moisturizer. When I received this product in the mail to try I was really excited. I love the way that it goes on your skin, it's very smooth with a mild scent. I have a oily T zone and dry creeks, and I found that wearing the product for a while it made my skin a lot more oily than normal. But it did brighten up my skin and left it feeling smooth. If this product came in a oily/dry combination I would defiantly buy it. All in all it's a nice moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects This was a great product to try from BzzAgent! With all the stress mounting with the upcoming holidays, the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer came just in time! The product has a pleasant smell and does not leave any greasy feeling on your skin. A little goes a long way and it really helped even out my skin tone as I used it over the last few weeks. As someone with sensitive skin, I found that this product also worked for me and I did see an improvement on those darn fine lines creep up on us. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"It's Finally Here! I've been waiting for a while and it finally arrived. I have been using for 5 days now and I am surprised that i am actually getting questions about what I am using on my face. I will be honest I was a little skeptical when it first arrived as I was a loyal fan of my tried and true cream. Not sure if it's the change in product, the actual ingredients themselves or what but I am certainly noticing something happening and people have been commenting at work about it. Let's see what happens after a solid week! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A Really Pleasant Surprise When I was chosen as one of the BzzAgents to try the new Olay Total Effects 7 In One Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I was a little bit hesitant at first because I always thought of the Olay line of products as being very oily and creamy meant for very dry and weathered skin types. Since I have naturally oily skin, I thought that it was going to make me breakout. But after trying the product, I was truly pleasantly surprised. It wasn't extremely oily at all but rather very smooth and fast-absorbing. I read the information details on the packaging and saw the 7 benefits in 1 as well as the addition of the VitaNiacin Complex which sounded all so amazing. Because I have been extremely busy due to the holiday season, I have used the product for several weeks now before even writing this review so I have really tried the product and seen the effects on my face closeup. I used the Olay moisturizer twice daily, morning and night, and loved it. It was non-greasy and fast-absorbing like it stated. It never clogged my pores and didn't make me breakout like I thought it might. Instead, it really helped with my uneven skin tone and moisturized my skin without making it feeling oily or sticky. I noticed that it seemed to minimize my pores overall and worked well under my face powder. I really liked that it was oil-free and believe that this is the reason why it didn't make me breakout. Overall, I enjoyed using this moisturizer and think this could be a great replacement for all those overpriced moisturizers out in the market today. I plan to look for this product at my favourite stores in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer After using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer (a trial size given to me at no charge in exchange for my review) I found my skin to be well hydrated and comfortable. Winter is hard on my skin but while using this product my skin did not feel tight, skin tone was evened out, and there were no dry patches, which meant make up went on smooth and looked great! Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer claims to -Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles -Evens skin tone appearance -Enhances brightness -Minimizes the look of pores -Visibly reduces age spots -Restores firmness -Replenishes moisture I found it helped with my fine lines and skin tone, and I may have looked a little brighter :) I am not sure it helped with the look of my pores but it did replenish moisture, and in turn, firmness. As far as age spots go I do not have any noticeable ones on my face so I cannot comment on that point. I look for a product the has little to no scent, does not sting or cause redness to my sensitive skin, does not make my skin feel tight, does not leave dry patches but also does not make my skin feel or look greasy. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer covered all of that. Overall I believe this product to do what it claims to to some degree. Everyone has different skin and different degrees of issues but I think by using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer people will find it will address at least some, if not all, of their skin issues.

"The products rocks! I am 35 and have been a bit lazy with my skin until now. My skin has started aging and I could not ignore it anymore my pores seemed to be getting larger, fine lines and just a very ruddy looking complexion. Also I have a dry skin, so was very worried if this will work or not but the results were surprising. My skin looks so much more refined. Fines line are not that visible and my complexion has been more brighter. I really think this super fast skin care repair that works great. Surely this product rocks! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This cream really replenishes moisture I have extremely dry skin and in the past very costly to maintain. This line of Oil of Olay has really made a beautiful difference in my overall skin health. I had dry sun damaged skin and just after a few days I could feel an improvement. The price is very reasonable compared to other products. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Life Changing I love this stuff. I have been looking for something that won't leave my face sticky or feeling like there was too much product on my skin and this is it! It absorbs very well into the skin and leaves a really smooth feeling. It smells really good so I don't mind using it at all. After a few weeks I seee a huge difference in my skin and how it feels. I will def be making this an everyday product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay total effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I wasn't sure when I received this product. I've tried Olay products before and they're a little pricey. I also have issues with adult acne so I'm super careful with what I use. This product works great! I didn't have any breakouts, it wasn't heavy or sticky, just smooth and moisturizing. I would like to try to bigger size when it comes out to see if there are real changes in my uneven skin tone and age spots but so far I'm impressed and would consider buying the product when it comes out in February!

"Awesome moisturizer My skin has been pretty sensitive lately so I became more choosy with the products I pick up. But this Olay Total Effects product has been working out great for my skin. It's been working exactly the way I expected it to - it mosturizes and leaves my skin very soft. Now with the weather transitioning into the winter temperatures, my skin needs extra moisture, and I am having to put extra mosturizing serum, or what not underneath, but it you don't generally have dry skin that this should be good to go! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loving the feel .... Loving the feel of putting this lotion on, and of my face even once the lotion has been on for hours. It goes on SO SMOOTH. It's very pleasant to put on, encouraging me to use it daily. The fact that it contains SPF is a very important feature to someone with fair skin like I have. Okay is a trusted skin care brand in general, and this 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer is no slouch either. My skin feels great with it on, knowing its healthy for my skin feels great, and as a result- I feel more confident. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"2 Week Update I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer once a day for the last 2 weeks. While I haven't noticed any huge differences, I have noticed my skin feels softer and more supple. It also has more colour to it, more glow. I'm sad that I'm almost out, but I bet with a few more weeks use, there would be even more of a change. Another bonus - my husband has an allergy to scent and he's been able to get up close and personal, and he says it smells nice and doesn't bother him at all. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Delicately Smooth I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is amazing. My skin feels silky and looks visibly smooth after just a few days! I am so excited to see how my skin looks and feels after 4 weeks! The only thing I would recommend is the unscented cream versus the scented. As it does smell very nice it's a little to strong smelling for my face, in my opinion. Other than that, wonderful product that I recommend! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good facial mosturizer Claims that the Olay Total Effects makes 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - does make the lines and wrinkles less noticeable, could be due to the fact that this moisturizer does have a bit of a beige colour to it 2.Evens skin tone appearance - does appear to even out the skin tone again, this could be due to the colour in the moisturizer 3.Enhances brightness - does enhance the brightness, again, this could be due to the colour in the moisturizer 4.Minimizes the look of pores - does make the pores less noticeable, again, this could be due tot he colour in the moisturizer 5.Visibly reduces age spots - does not reduce the age spots, the sample size is small (although much larger than some other sample I've received) and might need to use it for a longer period of time 6.Restores firmness - skin did feel a bit firmer but only lasted for a short period of time 7.Replenishes moisture - definitely moisturized and there is less dry flaky skin on my face Other things I like about the moisturizer is that there is no scent and does not tingle when it's used. Works just as well as the Clinique moisturizer in the short term basis but don't know about long term. Moisturizers seems to work well for the first couple that I use then and then after that not as well. My face may have gotten used to the combination of moisturizers and might be missing a few other key ingredients. When then happens, I usually go back to the Clinique which has not failed me yet.

"Olay Total Effects I was pleasantly surprised by the lightness of this moisturizer. It seems that when companies make moisturizers for mature skin, they tend to create a very thick formula. Not the case with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It is light enough to wear for daily use. I have yet to visibly see any changes with my skin since I've only been using it since I received it maybe 10 days ago. I am also very scent aware and was pleased that this product has a nice, light scent. I'd buy this moisturizer in store. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Works Nicely I have to admit, I don't always follow a regular routine for my skin and it pays the price. I've had to hold off on my review in order to indicate some results that are fair to Olay Total Effects. I have definitely noticed some smoothing in my face which is fantastic. I spend a ton of time outdoors in the winter which causes some chaffing for sure. It's been nice to see some of that reversed especially under my eyes which gets really rough for some reason (maybe from my eyes watering in the wind!). I very much luck out with a lack of age spots, but I've certainly found the Olay Total Effects evening and brightening my skin tone in general. Another really fab feature here is the lack of perfume in the product. I love that, and it sure makes it nice around the eyes because it doesn't cause stinging. Now, I've spoken to both the group of ladies that I work with as well as a couple of friends about Olay Total Effects and I've had feedback from them saying that they see a difference too. Now some of that might be flattery on their part, but true friends always tell you when you look like the dog's breakfast and I've had no indication of that either lol. I'm adding a pic, but please don't blame Olay for the look! I'll admit I'm unsure what the retail cost is on the Olay Total Effects, but I honestly think it would be worth the purchase as long as you stick with a regular use routine. Apart from simply being good for your skin, it's just a good idea to be good to yourself. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Totally Different I think that the second you open the box you will be surprised with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Agning Moisturizer. The Total Effects lotion has a silk like feel. This lotion feels amazing as you put it on your face, your skin absorbs all the youthful vitamin complex that makes this product a front runner against the 7 signs of aging we are all looking to conquer. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Agning Moisturizer smooths on like no other face lotion that I have tired, You will be left with amazing youthful skin that never looks or feels greasy.

"Hydrates skin like no other Love how the texture of my skin has improved from using this product. My skin looks smoother and noticeably hydrated and the dry patches from irritation due to allergic reactions from other products has drastically been reduced. Use it on my neck, face and hands to make them appear more youthful. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smells and feels great! Fighting the seven signs of ageing like my fine lines and spots are even better when using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1! This cream smells AMAZING and feels great on my face. It isn't greasy or shiny. Goes on smooth and doesn't even look like I have cream on my face which is very different from other creams I've tried. I appreciate a cream that I can see the difference in within a few days and I honestly can say there is a difference after using this cream. Some lines are no as visible, and skin looks more even! I would definitely recommend to a friend! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So Far, So Good I have been using my Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for 1 week now and really enjoy it. The consistency is great, not too thick but not too runny either. It goes on nicely and I need exactly 1 pump per day. I have noticed some reduction of fine lines on my face and look forward to continuing to use this product to see even more results! This product is definitely better than a lot of other daily creams I have used and I am sure it would be good to use under foundation or other face makeups, although I do not personally use either. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 I think this moisturizer is good for all adult females because it is very light weight and non greasy. I do have mild sensitive skin but I have no issues using this moisturizer. I have only used it for a couple of days thus I think it's too early for me to comment if I have noticed any visible results just yet. But only after a short period of use, I noticed some improvement in my uneven skin tone. And after applying the moisturizer, I immediately feel that I have better skin tone. I would recommend this product to my friends. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 I think this product is awesome! It leaves my skin feeling so smooth and radiant, soft and bright! This unique vitamin complex is helping to fight the seven signs of aging which include fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone. I am excited to be a part of this campaign! Before you get this product you want to know if your skin is experiencing those fine lines and age spots. I have been using this for one week and there is a noticeable difference in the fine lines around my eyes! I am excited to share my knowledge with you! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Final thoughts on Olay Total Effects I think that the most noticeable difference I have seen since using Olay Total Effects is a more even skin tone. The darker areas seem lighter and the fine lines are smoother. The unique vitamin complex really does help fight the seven signs of aging. This product absorbed well into my skin without leaving it feeling oily or dry. Loved the trial size which is perfect when seeing if a product is right for you.

"Initial thoughts I have only been using the product for about a week now so I have not seen much of a difference in my skin yet, I keep telling myself that it is working it's magic slowly! I use the lotion every morning and so far I have been liking it. It absorbs well and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy at all, and it is definitely keeping my skin moisturized. I will continue to use it every morning and give an updated review in a couple weeks! As of right now I would say so far so good and I look forward to seeing the end result!

"I got it Yeah! This is the first day I try Olay total effects anti-aging moisturizer. This cream smell very good. It penetrates totally my skin. It replenishes moisture, give a soft skin. It contains VitaNiacin, with Vitamins C and E exfoliates to enhance skin's natural self-renewal process for healthier-looking skin in 4 weeks. My skin is sensitive. This cream is burning my face with itching. I will continue to try it during a few days. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I actually liked it! I usually have a very dry itchy face during the fall and winter months. After using the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer for only 7 days, I already noticed a vast difference! My face feels dewey and didn't get irritated one bit! It also helped to reduce the lines I've started to notice around my eyes and the laugh lines near my mouth. I'm usually very skeptical about these sort of products but this one actually works nicely on me! Very happy with this trial and have been recommending the product since!

"Good cream so far... I have been using the Olay Total Eefects face cream for a little over a couple of weeks now and so far it has been a good cream. I can't say I have seen any improvement in fine lines and wrinkles, but it says that won't start to show until 4 weeks of use. Unfortunately, with the trial size, it won't get me to 4 weeks. What I do notice is the soft and smooth texture of the cream that also goes on very smoothly. It has a light and pleasant fragrance, not at all overpowering or perfume like. I like the cream, but need more time to give a complete opinion. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effects I tried this product for seven days and I have to say I did not some results the main one was the moisture back in my face, I have really dry skin and so far this is the only product that helps. It defiantly reduced the look of pores and brightened my skin. However being in my thirties I don't have to many wrinkles or any age spots so I can't say what it does for them. What I can say is I am definitely going to continue using this product. Thank olay for the sample and thank you for restoring moisture back in my face and making feel a little bit younger.

This product feels amazing This product feels amazing because it softens my skin in a way no other products have before
"Olay 7 in 1 that it is a fantastic moisturizer, which in turn gives your face that bright fresh look that most people want!!! I am not exactly sure of its full effects on those fine lines and wrinkles, as I believe that to truly say would take a much longer time to form an opinion. I have lots of fine lines around my mouth and chin and am hopeful they will slowly begin to dissipate! I believe that it has the potential to improve or at least diminish those flaws even just by moisturizing and brightening your overall skin tone! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love this cream! This bzzkit came in the mail at the perfect time! My skin was just starting to get super dry due to the weather, but after only less than a week of using Olay total effects my skin is moisturized to the perfect level, firmer, and with way less visible pores! I also really love how quickly it absorbs, and how my makeup doesn't melt off my face when this cream is underneath it, like alot of the other creams I've used. I will definitely purchase this cream again. Once the trial size is finished. Thanks BzzAgent! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So far so good I've been using this for a couple of weeks now. I'm not so sure I see the anti aging benefits, but maybe it's because I am just so gloriously youthful already (ignore the grey hairs). But my skin definitely looks brighter and clearer. The texture of the lotion is perfect - a small pump is enough for my face. The texture is incredibly smooth, and the hydration is ideal - not greasy or heavy at all. It sits well under my foundation, and my face feels so soft. I am looking forward to continuing to use this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Silky Smooth A little goes a long way with this cream. The first time I tried it, I squirted far too much in my hand to use. I learned my lesson quickly. I only needed a small amount. One tiny, tiny squirt. It spread very easily and evenly. The cream didn't feel oily when I was done. Some times that can be a problem with face cream. I like how it didn't have a strong scent either. All in all, this has been good so far. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I see the difference! Well I've been using this product everyday for the past couple weeks and I definitely can see and feel the difference! Winters here in MB are cold and dry and really take a toll on your skin, after using this product my skin feels so mosturized, more brighter and my pores appear smaller. I'm very impressed with the results so far that I've already purchased this product for when my trial bottle runs out. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good product, so far! I love the consistency of this product not too runny or too thick. The fragrance is nice, yet very light - which is great. It goes on effortlessly and seems to do a good job moisturizing. I have combination skin and it doesn't seem to cause any pimples to show up on my face or anything, which is much appreciated. I don't agree with the claim that it evens skin tone appearance, unless that takes quite a while to happen. Is it a revolutionary product in my books Probably not. Is it still nice to have Sure.

"Working well My skin is fairly dry, so it takes a good product to help get it less dry. This product seems to be getting more moisture in to my skin and in turn, making it look less old. It's going on smooth, goes a long way (don't need to use a lot), lasting throughout the day and there is a lot more in the container than you would think. It's still going after a few weeks, so it goes a long way. All are positive aspects for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
first try I am 19 years old and i bought this product last night and after washing my face i put it on. I was seeking for some reviews to see if i actually made the right choose and to see if this was going to help reduce my main problem which is enlarged pores and uneven skin tone. After reading some of the reviews i have seen here i do think this product will help me. After one use i can tell that my face feels softer. I will come back in the following weeks and review this product again to see if it actually worked on me.
"Brighter, softer... Knowing how much I love Olay moisturizer and how gentle it's been on my skin (I've been using their original beauty fluid since the age of 15), I was very excited to try a FREE sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for review. This particular moisturizer in Olay's vast line of products purported to do the following: 1) Minimize the appearance of fine lines 2) Nourish the skin with rich moisturization 3) Enhance and even out skin tone 4) Gently exfoliate 5) Minimize and refine pores 6) Defense against free radicals 7) Subtle lifting of the skin for a more youthful appearance Upon initial use, I found the product to have a nice light scent and a smooth velvety texture. The consistency was a little thicker than the moisturizer I normally use so I was hesitant at first to use it as my skin is easily irritated. However, I found it absorbed very well. Like any woman, I scrutinize my face on a regular basis. I noticed right away that my face felt immediately softer. While the fine lines remained after 3 weeks of use, I did notice that my skin seemed brighter within a week. I imagine if I was able to test a full-sized sample for a longer period of time, I would have noticed a bigger different. Though not as strong as some of the more expensive products out there, this one has great value and gives you what you three or more products would give you, all in one package. Overall, a nice everyday moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"what a difference I was surprised by how well this product worked on my skin. At first I was a disbeliever on all the things that it promised it will do to my face/skin however, from the first time I've tried it ... WOW! my skin felt nice and smooth. I also liked the smell of the product and how the lotion went on my skin. As for the signs of aging...I think it worked. I noticed that my wrinkles looked less pronounced and that my skin looked more even. I have a bit of rosiness on my cheeks and it started to look less reddish and more like my natural skin tone.

Prime moisturizer This my favorite Olay product. Regenerist Deep Hydratation Regenerating Cream leaves my skin so soft and it is not greasy. I can feel the difference when I miss a day without this fabulous moisturizer. Great value beauty product!! Highly recommend and let me tell you I look ten years younger.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Before I tried this product, I was wondering if it would accomplish all its 7 claims. Only using it for a few days, I immediately feel that it evens skin tone appearance and enhances brightness I am confident that it will deliver all its 7 anti-aging effects, however, it is just a bit early for me to say right now as I have only used for a few days. But I like this moisturizer very much, I feel very comfortable using this. This is a product for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Okay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Mosturizer I think this product is amazing....I can not believe the difference in my skin!!! It brightens the look of my skin and my pores don't look as big. I have been trying a lot of different things and this product has made the difference!!! I am definitely going to continue to buy this product as it has changed my self asteem!!!! I have struggled for years to find the right product and through this free offer I have finally found it!!!!! Sooooo happy ) This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"A nice cream I like that that the cream is light and doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy . . It is quickly absorbed into the skin, which is nice. The bottle comes with a little pump and seems to give you just the right amount each time I have only been using it for a week but have already noticed that a bit of the redness I have had for many years has diminished.i look forward to seeing the full effects after using it for a while longer.based on the results I have gotten after I week I would definetly purchase this and recommend it to friends as well! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great This product is great. It truly smells amazing.i would recommend this product to anybody.
"Great moisturizer, not greasy I've tried numerous moisturizers in my life. I'm always on the lookout for the best anti-aging moisturizer. I'm not 100 this is it yet, but I've not finished the sample yet so I'll give it a couple of more weeks. It's a great moisturizer, the texture is amazing and it's not greasy like other moisturizers I've tried. Yet, it looks like it would be strong enough for our cold Canadian winter. I wouldn't say it's a favorite of mine yet, but I might repurchase since I know it takes a while to see if the anti-aging properties are actually working.

"Great product with proven results! After using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer for a little over a week, I started noticing the difference in my skin. My skin felt moist and smoother, and more importantly, brighter than usual. The only drawback for me was the smell of the product which I found a little strong and thus, gave this product review 4 stars . However, the visible effects on my skin far outweigh the perfumy scent therefore, I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a one step daily application to smoother, brighter, healthier looking skin!

Oil of Olay I have always been skeptical of products that promise to reduce your age appearance and such. I don't know if I look 10 years younger from using this product or not but I love how it definitely delivers on the promise to even out skintone and minimize pores. The small amount that needs to be used is great and it's not greasy or oily and goes on silky smooth. I will continue to use this and see if I can actually look 10 years younger.

Olay 7 in 1 I think this is a good product. I found it to make my skin break out a bit but as I used it longer the break outs were less. I am not sure it reduced any lines or brown spots but my skin felt soft and less dry than it was when I started using the product. I will continue to use Olay 7 in 1 to see if I get better results as time goes on. I really loved the light scent and how well it blended in with out a oily feeling.

"Evened out skin tone Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has a unique vitamin complex helped to fight the seven signs of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone. I have found that it has even out my skin and is not as dry anymore. I have not used it ever day but if I had I could see it working on the fine lines and age spots. I am going to personally buy another bottle and try it again for 4 weeks everyday. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Soft and bright skin I have really been liking this sample of olay anti aging 7 in 1. My skin is softer and brighter with use. My wrinkles while still there are less deep and less noticable. You can feel it slightly tightening your skin after apllication. I dont have age spots so I can't speak on those but overall my face is more even toned and my pores are less visiable. I also find that it works great as a makeup base. Good job Olay. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"PRETTY GOOD product seems to work well, I haven't noticed any major antiaging qualities but does seem to help the acne"
"This is an excellent product. I am very happy with this cream. It really works. I notice finer lines and less defined wrinkles. Also, my brown blotches are lighter and the facial pores are smaller. My skin is softer and is less ruddy. This is so nice to look in the mirror and see improvement. Thank you for a good product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
My trial of Olay I really enjoyed the smell and how smoothly the cream went on my skin. It left my skin feeling silky and non dry. My skin seemed less dry after two days of use. I have only been using it for three days now but I will keep watching for other signs of improvement. In my overall opinion on this product is that I do believe it works. I have tried many creams on my face to relieve my dry skin and this cream appears to work great on my dry skin. I have had no adverse affects. I have numerous allergies and this cream doesnt bother them. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Impressed! I'm totally impressed with this Olay product! I have not used an Olay product for a long time and didn't know what to expect from this. But to my surprised it exceeded my expectations. After just one nights use I already noticed my skin looking healthier the next morning. It is very easily absorbed and doesn't feel greasy (which is a pet peeve of mine)! My skin did look smoother and more even after more than a week of usage! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Reverse signs of aging! I am a skeptic when it comes to anti-aging claims, so I am interested to see if Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer lives up to its (long!) name. I'm looking for anything that will help smooth out the fine lines and even out my skin tone as well as keep my skin feeling hydrated. I used it this morning and checked back after 30 minutes but did not notice much of a difference right away. The product claims to make a noticeable difference in 4 weeks, though, so I will use the product for 28 consecutive days (or until I run out of sample product!) and report back with my results. For this review I'll just focus on my first thoughts: 1) I appreciate that my sample is fragrance-free. I am sensitive to fragrances and this one just left me smelling clean. 2) I LOVE the way the cream feels. It is like a cloud on your skin, seriously. Most moisturizers leave me feeling greasy and heavy but this one is so smooth and left my skin hydrated but dry. 3) This product comes with a pump which I like much better than the regular squeeze tops. But you probably don't need the whole pump! I used a whole one today and it was too much for my face and neck. Next time I'll use half a pump and add more if I need it. 4) My current moisturizer provides my skin with vitamins and nutrients so I was really happy to hear that Total Effects does the same, and that is what really helps fight the signs of aging. I am giving this a 4/5 today because I like the feeling of the cream but did not notice immediate effects. We'll see what happens in a month! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So far, so good So far I like the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer that I GotItFree from OlayUS and BuzzAgent. As of yet I haven't seen much for the anti-aging effects, but I've only been using it for about a week now. I have oily, but sensitive skin, so I find it a little difficult to find a moisturizer that works for me. I have had no problems with this moisturizer causing break-outs or skin redness. It feels light-weight and non-greasy and drys quickly. Looking forward to seeing the other benefits as I continue to use this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
OlayTotal7in1 The box has all the information you would need to know before purchasing this item. From the time you take the bottle out of the box I was impressed. I like the colours and the sleekness of the shape. When you squeeze the lotion onto your finger it feels so smooth. Goes onto your face so nice and has a nice smell. Does not feel greasy on your face at all. Would buy this product and will share my information with friends and family. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Does it work Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging What can I say about this product, well I am not sure if it works. I will say it does make my face moisturized and it feels good on my face. But I can't say if it reduce fine lines or even my skin tone. I think longer usage is require to know the affect or to notice the difference. I am glad that I found a product that works on my sensitive skin. As well, I feel that I got some glow. So, I will continue to use it and will recommended. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Very impressed The first thing I noticed was that my skin was very soft after using the entire sample. I didn't notice a significant impact on fine lines, but it did seem to blur them a bit. I'd be interested in getting a full bottle when it's available because I think it actually works. Olay is a brand I trust as well, so I'm pretty pleased overall. Luckily, I don't have age spots (yet!) but if I continue to use this, I'm sure I'll be set! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My skin looks fine Since i employ thie new Total Effects from Olay, to protect my skin has never be funny like that.. I enjoy the trial size, and 1 push from the pump is the good amount of the cream tu use... It's my first step the morning . Before buying it i would like to know if it's a night or day cream. The 7 in 1 moisturizer has a vitamin complex that help to fight the signs of aging.. My skin is more even and soft.. GotitfreefromOlayUS BzzAgent This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Soft cream and soft skin As a mid-30s women who still suffers from adult acne, I often look for moisturiZers to help with that and not quite ready for anti-aging products. That being said, I really enjoyed this product. I found it really soft and smooth on my skin and left my skin so soft. In the short time I've used it I can't really tell how much it helped aging and wrinkles but I did enjoy how it felt on my skin and didn't cause more breakouts which is usually my concern. definitely a product I will consider in the future when looking more at anti-aging products. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Best Moisterizer I think this is one of the best moisterizer ever that I have tried ( other than my regular one offcourse). I have been Olay customer for over a decade but they don't manufacture the white cream anymore so having a chance to try this Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer was a welcome gift for me. It not only feels great on my skin but blends so well as If I dont have any cream on my face. It also makes my skin soft and bright. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Couldn't go without it I ran out of the deep hydration regenerating cream and tried some that I had tried before that was left over and the immediate difference was so noticeable. My skin was not soft and smooth as it was when using this cream so went and bought more and haven't gone without it now for some time. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Best stuff ever Awesome stuff use daily for next results .............
"Softer, smoother skin I really like this product. I wish I had enough of a sample to finish the four weeks, but after 2.5 weeks my skin feels softer, smoother and firmer. My skin tone is more even and brighter. It goes on nicely, it's not sticky or greasy. It has a light, subtle scent which is great because I'm sensitive to over powering fragrances. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to make their skin look a little brighter, smoother and softer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice product ! I think this a good product for a late twenties gal ! At first I like the smell and the texture of the cream, but after finishing the bottle I saw a little difference in the wrinkle near my eyes and my forehead. I will not say it is spectacular, but still, I saw something. I gave it 4 stars because I thought that the product had a lot of qualities and a reasonnable price. My face was brigther, well hydrated, smelled nice, seemed silky and a little smoother. I liked it ! I think it can be a good essential too keep your skin healthy!

"Olay Total Effects I have used this product for 7 days now and I love it! I am always skeptical on anti-aging products and I was skeptical with this one too. The cream has a nice fragrance and consistency and definitely provided my skin with the moisture it required. Low and behold after a week of daily use, my fine lines have smoothed out and are not as noticeable. Especially in-between my eyes. My sample is almost done so I will be looking for this product.

Works great Works great because it helps reduce signs of aging
Olay 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer I have been using the moisturizer that I received from bzzagent for free to try for about a week so far. I find if I put it on at night my face seems to look fresher and brighter in the morning. the scent is a tad strong for me. it's not a bad smell just a little strong. It goes on really smooth and a little really does go a long way. I think I may let my mom give it a try after the 4 weeks is up. ( 4 weeks is the time frame it says you should notice a difference) This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"No Changes! I honestly didn't notice any changes. Nothing seemed to get firmer or have visible results. I was really hoping to fight uneven skin tone, but I really didn't notice anything. However, this moisturizer was good in a sense that it wasn't oily! This did not irritate my skin nor did it make my skin break out. Even though I didn't see any changes in the short term, I think I just might buy a bottle and use it for long term. It's hard to find a moisturizer that works, so if it doesn't give me anti-aging results, at least I can still use it as a moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Is the smell worth the results Overall the product works fairly well, it is hydrating although I am not sure that it actually make a difference in the fine lines and uneven skin tone but I don't think there are very many products currently on the market that do. However my major beef with the product is the smell. It is awful and chemically and I hate putting it on my face as a result. When there are so many other products that offer similar results but smell good I would tend use them instead. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Moisturizer We have very cold and dry winters where I live, and so I am used to using a very thick, moisturizing cream. Because of this, I began using this Olay moisturizer with my skin already soft and in good condition (not dry/patchy/oily). When first using the moisturizer, I found it to be very easy to spread (it isn't thick), and it dried quickly. However, I did notice that it left a bit of a sheen to my skin (kind of a slightly damp-skin look). It wasn't unpleasant, nor overly oily, but I do suspect this was what gave my skin a brighter look/youthful glow. Although this did work wonderfully as a moisturizer, I did not notice any difference to the laugh lines/fine lines on my face, but perhaps 3.5 weeks of use is too early to draw a conclusion about this. I don't yet have age spots, so I cannot speak to whether or not it is effective at minimizing their appearance. I have only ever used 1 other kind of anti-aging moisturizer (Meaningful Beauty), which I found left my skin scaley and oily. It was a miserable experience and took weeks to repair the damage it caused. This Olay moisturizer fares so much better. Because Olay has fared so well in terms of maintaining my skins moisture in our harsh climate, I have (and will continue) to recommend this moisturizer to others. Please note that I received this product as a free trail from Olay as a part of a Bzz Campaign, but all of my feedback is of my own, honest opinion. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Mpoisturized and clean scented I was surprised by how much i liked this product. The cream is very moisturizing and feels rich but absorbs quite quickly. I found that for me I dont have many wrinkles yet, but that my skin looked and felt very plump after using this cream. I cant really say forhte long term benefits as the sample size is quite small, but in the short term it really helps soothe dry skin and does give it quite a boost. I also really liked that the scent was not too strong. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Younger looking skin I used Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating cream for a week and I already felt a significant difference in my skin. It flt softer, smoother and better hydrated. Within weeks my fine lines were less noticeable. This is an awesome product that I would highly recommend. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Vanessa455 Having grown up with a mom that always used Olay products, I was really excited to try Olay Total Effects! After having used it for two weeks, I can definitely say that I am impressed so far. I have fairly dry skin and I can already notice a difference in how soft and smooth my skin feels, and maybe it is wishful thinking but I feel there is a difference in the lines around my eyes...It would be nice if it was a little larger bottle. I've been trying to ration it to make it last for 4 weeks. Looking forward to seeing any changes after the next two weeks! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Okay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Cream even though the main reason I was excited for this product was its claim on age spots, it it a nice light weight cream. I have very sensitive skin and I did not have any negative issues. I did not notice any difference in my age spot after 1 month of use. It looks the exact same. As a brightening cream it is beautiful. I use it under my foundation and my skin feels smoother and definitely looks brighter. I liked this cream so much I even purchased my own full size jar.

Olay Total Effects I was very excited to receive Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer as I typically don't use a moisturizer. And I was curious to see if it worked. Sadly between illness that circulated our home for several weeks I didn't use it consistentlyBUTI did love the fact you only need a very small pea-size amount to cover a large area and I LOVED that it took away the dryness feeling I typically have on my face after using my cleanser. I will continue to use the moisturizer and try to make it part of my every day routine and can't to see more lasting effects! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Intriguing product. I think that from the product size I was given to try that I will positively be following up with a purchase of the product. While the size may not have been large enough to see the long term effects I have alot of interest in it. I love everything about it. From the way it goes on so smooth and light, the packaging, it has a nice aroma , feels great just before applying make up as well. I would like to see how after more use it diminishes age spots and wrinkles This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects I think the Olay Totla Effects was pretty good. I don't really have many lines yet. But I did notice the few around my eyes were diminished, and it did make my skin feel good. I really liked the mild scent, and it's not a heavy cream that just sits on your skin. I liked how you don't have to use a lot of the product, a little seemed to go a long way. I would purchase this product, just because of how good the cream makes my skin feel, and who wants crepey looking eyes This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I think it's okay At the time of this review, I've used the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about 3 weeks now. One good thing, it smells great - a light floral scent without being too overpowering. The moisturizer is also very light and isn't creamy or greasy at all. My skin is quite sensitive and doesn't respond well to new lotions or creams. After using it for a good 3 weeks, I'm happy to report that my skin hasn't had any breakouts or red patches! It seems to have adjusted to the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer quite well. The husband and daughter also don't mind the smell which is a definite bonus. So, why the 4 stars and the lukewarm title Well, I guess it's because I haven't really noticed any significant changes to my skin. I mean, it feels great but it felt great even before I started using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Have I noticed fine lines and wrinkles being smoother or reduced Um, not sure, nothing noticeable and the hubby certainly hasn't mentioned anything. Does it even out my skin tone appearance, enhance brightness, reduce look of pores, age spots, restore firmness, or replenish moisture Again, not sure to all of the above except that I can say it continues to keep my skin moisturized. That much I have noticed. Does it replace my old moisturizer I don't think so. Do I think someone would love it Yep. I'm just on the fence about it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Miracle cream Okay Total Effects is amazing. It's a cult favourite. I know of this moisturizer because my mom uses it all the time. She is 65 and gets compliments about her skin every time. I have been using this for about a month, but since then my skin texture has been transformed. I use to have many dry patches, and dark spots. so I need a moisturizer that will also help with dullness and making it look energized and beautiful. After a month I see the differences. Olay is the only drugstore brand I find that actually works and is worth buying. I recommend this moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
A Staple I Can Count On... I've been using Olay products for years because of how effective they have been for my skin. The Total Effects was no exception. I used the lotion primarily at night as there was no SPF. The fairly thick lotion went on and was absorbed by my skin quickly and smoothly with no scent (a definite plus for me). It moisturized my face during the night leaving it smooth the following morning. It's definitely worth buying the next time I need a night time mositurizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Didn't like it at first but love it now! I have sensitive skin and i found the first 2 weeks it was worse but I wanted to tough it out. Now my skin looks awesome. My face is nice and evenly toned. I have noticed some of the smaller wrinkles are reducing. My face feels nice and smooth. But most of all it stays moisturized. I don't feel like I have to re apply during the day. In fact it still feels moisturized in the morning. I will be buying this cram when it runs out. Thanks for letting me try it bzzAgent! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great Moisturizeer I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the last 7 days. Overall I would say it's a pretty good moisturizer. My skin feels nice and soft. I can't really say I've noticed any visible difference in any fine lines but that being said, I don't really have many. My skin does appear to have a more even tone though which I really like. I think the best feature is the moisturizing. It's been a pretty dry winter and my skin feels quite moisturized. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Awesome Moisturiser The Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream is a great moisturizer for achieving youthful looking skin. When applied it gives a smooth finish to the skin and makes it look fresh. This is the only skin care product I use and I'm very satisfied with the results.

"Another hit for Olay! Olay Total Effects is a great moisturizer that improves skin texture, moisturizes without feeling greasy, evens skin tone, firms, and minimizes pores! Fortunately I am not yet faced with age spots and wrinkles but I will definitely continue to use the product to help slow the aging hands of time! My skin definitely looks brighter and smoother!! Next time I will try the fragrance free moisturizer as my skin has been more sensitive during the dry winter months! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This product is everything I need in one! As of late, I've been suffering from uneven skin tone, large pores, and the beginning states of fine lines. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has brightened and firmed my skin, and reduced the look of fine lines around my mouth and eyes. I have oily skin, and it reduces the look of my pores without feeling greasy or heavy: my skin is left moisturized and firm. This is an affordable alternative to expensive department store moisturizers it works!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Aging gracefully A good product took a little longer to see the results then my usual product, not that expensive still work."
"Best results Used for years and had great skin results in softening, moisturizing, and even tone with affordable cost and saving comparable to other products available. Smell of product is not overwhelming and very tolerant."
"Amazing moisturizer I've had issues with anti aging creams in the past. They are too perfume-y, too thick or make me break out. I'm 32 and have a few age spots around my eyes. I love how thick Olay Total Effects is and how quickly my skin absorbs it. I've been using it for a few weeks and no breakouts and I feel like my age spots are fading. I like that the trial size will be available for purchase as I like to try before I commit to a large regular size because I like to know if my skin likes it before I buy the full size product.

Awesome product. Recommended to obtain healthy skin. It's a great product.
"Smooth Application I love the smooth application of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer! Of the various moisturizers I've tried in the past, this 1 has the best bottle because of the perfect pump. 1 squeeze of the pump always dispenses the perfect amount of product so there's no mess, fuss, or waste. And the ease of use continues onto the application results, as it's so silky smooth to put on, leaves my skin smooth too! There's a bit of a shimmer to it though, so I wouldn't recommend using it in the morning if you're like me with combination to oily skin don't need any added glow during the day.

"my all-time favorite i've used many moisturizers before signing up for this campaign and they all promise the same thing but without the results. since trying the olay total effect 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer for the last 2 weeks (day and night) i have noticed an improvement to my skin. my skin tone definitely appears more even and less ashy. my fine lines seems to have minimalized and less visible. my pores and age spots are not as noticeable as before . my skin looks more bright and feels much firmer. i like the fact that the moisture absorbs quickly. when i finish this trial bottle, i will definitely be stocking up.

"Impressed with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 I received my sample from Olay the other day and I am so excited to give it a try. I am posting day 1, 2 and 3, and although I have used it daily for the past three days, I see no difference in the wrinkles. I do however feel like my skin is more moisturized, softer, nonoily, skin tone is brighter. I did not feel any burning, or any smell, I did feel some tightness about a half hour after applying the cream each time. This must mean it's working, we will have to wait and see. I love the vitamins, I love the feeling when applied. It will be nice to see if it helps close some of these 40 year old pores. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So Far, SOOOOO Good I got this pretty neat trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer awhile ago, but was nervous about using it because I have very sensitive skin. But I finally gave it a whirl last week, and after 4 days I already see a bit of a change WITH NO REACTIONS. I don't have any bumpy skin like I usually have on my forehead upper cheeks, and my skin is more even coloured. I put it on while I sleep, and clean it off when I get up and go about my day, so any dirt or sweat won't interact with the cream and make me break out.

"Works great! I've used Regenerist lotion for several years and loved it. As I've gotten older I've found I need a heavier moisturizer. I switched to the Regenerating Cream and it's fantastic. Just like home, but better. Absorbs well, leaves my skin feeling well moisturized and velvety smooth."
"Review of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I think that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a great product for women who have aging skin. It smoothed, brightened, clarified and hydrated my skin. I used it twice a day for the whole month and found that I had less breakouts, less fine dry lines and my complexion looked bright and smooth. I would recommend people try this product if they are searching for an effective antiaging moisturizer at a great price. My only issue with is the light scent. I prefer unscented products personally. Other than that, I loved the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer experience! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smooth appeal... I think the Olay Total Effects 7 in one Anti-Aging Moisterizer does a wonderful job of giving moisture and life in a non-greasy way to my skin. I can only comment for myself, as I really don't have wrinkles or any of the other signs of aging that this product is supposed to help. It does provide a youthful, fresh feel to my face, and I've only used it for the last five days, so I can't comment on the long term effects, but would I continue to use it Perhaps, but it is too soon to comment further. I do appreciate BzzAgent for providing this free sample size to comment on. Olay is a product line I have used for years, and I trust their products, and yes, I would encourage my friends to give it a try themselves...:) If I was my friends, I would want to know the 7 effects of aging and how Olay Total Effects in one could combat those aging issues. I would also want to know if it was safe and would it have cause and effects to prevent and protect by its usage the expediancy of those issues if I was to use it prematurely. Like I said, I love the product, it's mild fragrance, it's moisturizing appeal, with a non-greasy feel, it's unique vitamin complex which helps to fight the seven signs of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tones, to name a few, and how it lasts all day without having to reapply. This is a product to keep an eye out for in the coming months! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"seeing the signs of change I've always used Olay products but this is my first time with Total Effects 7 in 1, and I am noticing a very positive change. I'm only 31 and have tried to take good care of my skin so my skin hasn't shown much age but the laugh lines and - mommy eye lines have been making a more visual presence. I am impressed to so those lines softening any my pores closing again. When the bottle I have on the go for my usual Olay runs out I will be making this my first pick when I go to the store This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"New favorite! Personally I have never used a moisturizer for my face in my life, and was very surprised at how soft my skin felt after using this moisturizer for the first time! I have found a new love for this product, and will now be using it daily! I've also always had a problem with my uneven skin tone and a few wrinkles under my eyes and it made me very self-conscious about my appearance. But, with this new product from Olay, Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer my skin tone looks more even and it has even gotten rid of some of my wrinkles! I am so amazed by the results!

"It's a keeper I know I like a product if I purchase it after my trial sample is over. I really liked the Olay total 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer. It went on silky smooth. I didn't feel like I had too much on my face. I REALLY liked the pump dispenser. It seemed do much more hygienic than dipping your finger in a tub of cream. I think my skin looked well hydrated. The reason I didn't give it a 5 out of 5 was because it didn't really fade dark spots. I had a few on my cheekbones and they did not fade much if at all. I do think my skin tone looked more even which in turn, looked brighter. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I like it... I'm just not sure if I love it yet This product felt great on my very dry skin, absorbing quickly and leaving my skin looking refreshed. I have sensitive skin (meaning I can get hives from heavy perfumes etc) and while I don't love the smell of this cream, it didn't cause any negative reaction in my skin so I was very pleased. While I've been using it for a couple of weeks, I haven't seen an impact on my age spots and uneven skin tone, but I'm hoping further use will see the promised results. I'd like to try the fragrance-free and I think the SPF option would be great to skip an extra step in my skin care. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Noticeable Skin improvement I was so excited to try Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer. I have a few sun spots on my face and have been trying to find a product that will help fade their dark colour. I am also prone to extreme dry patches. I used the sample twice daily until the sample was gone. I loved the light scent as well as the smooth feeling it left underneath my makeup. After just a short time my skin felt moisturized and smoother. While it did not fade sun spots as much as I had hoped they did fade a bit. I'm looking forward to purchasing this product to see if the benefits continue. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Good Moisturizer, Not Sure About The Anti-Aging Using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the first time was exciting! Who doesn't want to look younger I was particular interested in the wrinkle and fine line smoothing, and the reducing the look of pores. I've officially used it every day since receiving it, annnnnd... sad to say, I can't see much of a difference. In terms of anti-aging, I'm not sure it did much for me that my regular moisturizer doesn't already do, I suppose. Nothing on my face really changed. My forehead wrinkles remained small crevasses, my pores are still as visible as ever, and my skin tone is unchanged. I've attached a picture of my forehead lines before and after I'd used Olay Total Effects for awhile. As you can see, not much of a change. However! I give it an A+ for being a moisturizer! It's smooth, it's soft, it's light. It spreads across the skin nicely, it moisturizes like a boss, and it has a really nice scent. It doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy at all. Usually I'm not a fan of putting on moisturizer on before I go to bed, since it leaves my skin feeling kind of gross (and often leads to a breakout), but when I felt how light it was, I wanted to give it a try. Four weeks of moisturizing before bed, no greasiness, no acne. I have a strangely mixed review for this product, unfortunately. While it fell short (for me) in the anti-aging department, I'd still say it's a great moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Really evens skin tone I suffer from an uneven skin tone. My skin unfortunately is blotchy in areas that are very noticeable. It's embarrassing. I was hoping to see improvement in my skin tone with this product and IT DELIVERED!! My skin is now more even in tone and people have made positive comments on how my skin now looks. The cream is beige in color and has a light fresh scent, it glides on the skin evenly and quickly. After rubbing the lotion into the skin, it instantly hydrates the skin leaving the area silky and smooth to the touch. There is no harsh smell with the lotion. It has a fresh, clean smell. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loving It! It has been awhile since I have used Olay and now I am converted back! I love this new Olay anti-aging moisturizer. It comes in a pump so the rest of the cream does not get contaminated. It is a thick cream that is perfect for this winter season. I love to use it in the evenings. It absorbs fast and I could feel immediate hydration. Non greasy and no bad odor. I could see myself purchasing a full size of the Olay anti-aging moisturizer. I have no idea if it does anything to my fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tones. I guess I would need a few months to see if the cream does anything. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Product smells amazing. Haven't used but I hear this item is very good. May use in the future.
"My New Moisturizer! After trying this product through a free trial from BzzAgent, I will be purchasing this as my new daily moisturizer. Very smooth texture, no greasy feel even at the end of the day, my skin looked more even all over and no scent was a bonus for my sensitive skin. I'm not sure it made any difference with my little lines and wrinkles but maybe over time I will see a noticeable improvement. I was also pleased to learn that they also have this same lotion available with sunscreen. Thanks Olay BzzAgent! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Very good for a drugstore brand I have been using it for a week in the morning. I have tried many high end brands and always go back to Olay as they are drugstore but better than a lot of the expensive brands. I have oily combination skin and always thought anti-aging moisturizer always makes my skin extra oily. But not with this one. This one hydrates my skin but not making it oily. Notice a slight blurring of fine lines around my eyes after a week use. Not so much with age spots. Guess will have to keep using it for longer period of time. Very happy that I got to try this and will buy this once I have used up my bottle. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Olay - so far so good I tried Olay seven signs of aging cream. I find that it goes on smoothly and instantly becomes dry. Ideal to apply make up shortly after the cream. It has a very faint smell to it which is really nice. I feel it would not be a great product for someone with dry skin as I felt that my skin got a bit dry (I have combination skin.) I did use a moisturizing serum before putting on the cream and that seemed to help keep my skin hydrated. I have yet to see a difference in the aspect of my skin as I have only been using it for two weeks. I received a sample product for free to test and review.

"Amazing results!! I think this new Oil Of Olay product is amazing! I've been using it since I got it free fromBuzzAgent and all I have to do is use it and review it!! I've noticed in the last 14 days that my pores are so much smaller, as well as the tiny lines around my eyes have almost disappeared! My skin is soft and bright and just perfectly moisturized. No more dry skin. I've tried so many different products on my face and this is the one I'll be sticking to and using forever! I absolutely LOVE this product!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love This Product! I've been using this for a couple of weeks now, and I've seen great improvement in my skin. My pores are looking smaller, and it's helping with those dark 'age spots' that we all seem to get as we start getting older. The lotion is nice and fresh, and isn't heavily perfumed like some other lotions that I have tried. It doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy, it just leaves you feeling soft and full of moisture. Very satisfied with this product and would recommend to friends, in fact I have! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Softer, smoother skin I think the Olay total effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging moisturizer is a great product. I have used the entire sample I received free from Olay and BzzAgent and I'm pleased with the results. The moisturizer goes on nicely, it's not greasy or sticky like some I have used in the past. I have noticed a diffenece in the tone of my skin. My complexion seems more even, dark spots seem a little lighter and my face feels smoother overall. I'm not stuck on the scent, it's a bit overpowering. I work in a scent free environment so I can't wear this everyday. An unscented option would be great. Overall, it's another great Olay product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love it Best stuff Eva. Smooth creamy goes on effortless love how it stays underneath my foundation without making me feel greasy.
"Improves skin tone and fine lines I have now been using this cream for over a month and wanted to update on the changes that I have seen in my skin. I noticed some differences right away using this cream with the tone and texture of my face. Mostly this had to do with my skin being much more moisturized and feeling a lot softer. This cream continues to deliver in these areas, and even with the winter cold my skin has stayed moisturized and I have not had as many of the rough, dry patches that I usually get when the cold weather hits. However, now that I have been suing the Olay Total Effects for longer I have seen small changes in the fine lines and appearance of my skin as well. I am fortunate to have good genes but I do have a number of areas where age is creeping in and I am staring to get small lines or a change in the tone of my skin. The Olay Total Effects has helped with decreasing the appearance of the lines and making them less notices. I have also noticed that over time my skin is much more supple and there is an improvement in the tone and evenness of my skin. I do struggle with having uneven skin tone and the Olay has helped with keeping my face much more balanced and ensuring that there are not as dramatic changes in the colour and texture of my face overall. I am happy with this product and feel like it is making a difference for my skin and helping with a more youthful appearance. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Quite Pleased I received a free sample of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturier from Olay via BzzAgent. The product makes 7 promises and for me personally I think it did all of them, although not in as huge of a way as I was hoping for. The one I noticed the most though was how it made my skin brighter and evened my skin tone. I was, however, very pleased with the product and in addition to fulfilling its promises, it also has a really nice delicate fragrance to it and is light and fast-absorbing and not at all greasy.

Total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer I have completed my free trial of Oil of Olay and wanted to update my results. I have notice some fine lines around my lips have seem to become unnoticeable however not much more of a difference overall. I really liked this moisturizer because it didn't make my face oily. Most other types of moisturizer make me oily and breakout. I am going to actually keep up with this brand and purchase my first bottle tomorrow. I am now a lover of Oil of Olay 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer ! Thanks for my free trial or else I would have never knew that there was a moisturizer out there that doesnt make me oily or breakout!

"Younger Looking Skin! I've been using Olay products since I was in my 20's, as my mom always used them. I especially love the younger, firmer, results that daily use of Regenerist Cream. I look younger and my skin is amazingly firm. At 68, I look like I'm in my 50's! Thanks Olay Regenersit! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Pleasant results I received the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer to try out as a BzzAgent, and wanted to use it for a few weeks before giving an opinion, since it usually takes at least that long for my skin to adjust to a new product or regime. My first thoughts on this product were very positive: 1-texture and formula: One of my favorite things about the product is how light and silky it is. It feels very smooth and light, even though it packs a punch in terms of performance. I find sometimes products that claim the same as this are very heavy, thick and sticky, and this is not like that at all. It also spreads very nicely and is easily absorbed. 2-scent: This product has a very mild sweet scent, which I really like, because products that smell too strongly or perfumed are not pleasant to use. This has a mild scent which fades within minutes of application. Now, as for actual performance, I give this product a solid 4 out of 5 stars. I didn't notice much of a difference in my fine lines overall, however, I do see a big difference in my complexion. My skintone is more even and looks healthier. I'm not sure this product is heavy enough for how dry my skin gets in the dead of winter, but it's a wonderful cream so far that has kept my face adequately moisturized. I think it's a fantastic solution for anyone with normal to mildly dry skin for overall improvement. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Visible difference in a short time. I have been using Olay products for years. Until receiving this trial for Total Effects, I thought my skin was getting all the moisture it needed. I find this moisturizer so creamy and penetrating. For minutes after application, I can feel the soft moisture soaking into my skin. I do have 'thick' skin and I get oily in my t-zone throughout the day. This still happens, but I am not having mini break outs like I did before. I notice my skin is brighter, definitely more clear and I believe my pores appear smaller too. Would highly recommend this product and will be buying the full size version once it's available. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Still A Great Product I used to use Total Effects years ago and it's nice to see that nothing if anything much has changed in the product. It still goes on well, isn't too heavy and it makes my skin feel replenished. I do find that it evens out my complexion, which is nice on days when I forget to wear makeup. I don't have many wrinkles and no age spots, so I can't comment on whether or not it helped on those fronts. But my skin almost looks dewy now. The weather lately has really played havoc with my skin and I find that everything is dry, except for my face! I wonder if Total Effects makes body lotion... It's also a good product at a good price.

"Great product! I think that the olay anti aging effects 7 in 1 Moisturizer is a great product. I have combo oil/dry skin and have been using this for approx. 6 weeks. I have noticed my skin isn't as dry in this Terrible winter weather, have not noticed any more fine lines, and don't have any wrinkles! I recieved a FULL SIZE bottle for my free trial thanks to Bzzagent, and still have lots left after daily usage. It looks like a small amount, but it really goes far. Such a great value! This moisturizer is lightweight and goes on smooth. I really feel it fills in all the small lines in my face. No need for a primer when I have this product!

"Olay total effects 7 Ok so I decided to try the product. It's been roughly a week since I've been using it. I put it on at night when I wash and go to bed. I was a bit iffy about trying the product as my skin is very picky. (I have only found one other product that I can use) well I must say the product is awesome. I didn't break out, as I have skin issues psoriasis! My is so soft I can not tell about the wrinkles yet as I only have a few fine lines but I think if I keep using it, it could help. My skin tone has changed for the better, my face feels and looks more youthful. I will be using this product again for sure. Ooooh did I say it is non oily!!

"Love this line. In the nearly approaching year, I will be 45. I have been using total effects anti aging products for over 10 years now. As I am blonde with pale skin, I like to use the sunless tanner one. I have minimal wrinkles and fine lines and look more like I am in my 30's than 40's. This product felt velvety smooth on my hand and applied smoothly to my face. I did not mind the scent. I would love to see this product in a sunless tanner with an spf as well. Then I would have everything I need in one moisturizer. Not sure what this product would be priced at, but if along the same pricing as the other similar products, I would buy it.

Silky smooth This product feels great on your skin and gives a glow after applied
"Very nice moisturizer I think this moisturizer is going to be a staple product for me. I love the light fresh fragrance,and by day 2 my skin looked brighter and smoother. Also there does seem to be a reduction in pore size. Concerning age spots I can't comment,luckily I don't have any. Yet. Although if I continue using Olay total effects maybe it won't ever become a problem. From what I've seen at my local pharmacy Olay appears to be fairly priced,I feel like a small amount goes along way in application so a full sized bottle should last fairly long. Also, my teenage daughter commented on day 4 of the trial that your skin looks really good mom! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I really like this moisturizer! I am a skeptical person by nature. I generally don't believe things I read or hear, unless I see some kind of proof, especially when it comes to marketing of products. So, when I received a freebie of the new trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I was not going to leave a review until I had actually tried it for the recommended time and could offer concrete opinions to other women. I am a busy working mom of two, and honestly, moisturizing daily sometimes gets forgotten. I really noticed how my skin drank in the Olay 7 in 1. I took a close-up selfie before I started, and then again 3 weeks later, and I definitely can see a few improvements. For example, the lines near my eyes are fainter, I cannot deny. Overall, my skin is brighter and feels firmer. My skin tone is more even, and I've noticed that my makeup goes on more smoothly and evenly, which is a definite plus. I can't say that my red spots have faded all that much perhaps more time is needed for that. For a cream, though, I'm impressed with the effects it has had. I am not into invasive procedures like surgery or Botox, so for me, a moisturizer that does what it claims to do is important. I do wish the trial size had a little bit more product in it, though. Olay says we can see the full effects after 4 weeks, but I found that I was only able to get 3 weeks out of the trial size, using it once daily. For that reason, I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars.

"Not a miracle, but what is So of course I am always expecting some miracle cream that will magically make the wrinkles disappear and cure my red cheeks. This is not that magical cream, however, compared to all other creams out there, I think it is good. I have dry skin and it has helped moisturize my face. So far, the slight wrinkles are still the same, and the uneven appearance (reddness) is still there. Since I have found nothing to fix those things, I suppose there is no fix and therefore compared to all competitors, I think this is about the same. I continue to try for a longer period of time to see if the effects come with consistency and time. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
The only cream needed I'm a person that does not use makeup. I wash my face and apply Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream. My face feels and looks hydrated and I am often asked what is my secret. I never hesitate to say that I only use Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream.

"Review of Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer The cream went on smooth and did not feel sticky.I felt like I had no cream on which is good in the summer time. The cream does make your skin appear more even and brighter. I have large pores so the cream did help to make them less noticeable. I do like that the cream is not contaminated when trying to use it because it uses a pump instead of consumers using their fingers,makeup brush etc. Not crazy about the cream's fragrance. Did not notice a difference with wrinkles because I was already using a good cream before I tried the 7-in-1. Would I buy this Yes, I liked what it did for skin brightness and pore concealment. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Make sure you do your research! It is a good product but not for everyone. It is to heavy for some and you don't have enough information about the product before you buy to know this. Olay is a good company I just feel that it is very difficult to decide which one of there face lotions to use.
Week One Complete Very happy with my results so far after the first week using the new trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. The unique combination of vitamins in this product is starting to make a noticeable difference in my skin tone and fine lines. The product is nice and thick so a little goes a long way. My skin stays very moisturized all day. I think I would prefer the unscented version as the scented seems to make my eyes run for a while after applying in the morning. I am hopeful it will help with fading a couple of age spots I have after the trial is finished. Love trying my Olay from BzzAgent GotItFree. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Spa quality product! Well I've used Olay total effects for a while now, and have noticed pretty good results! I first want to start by saying I love the the pump style bottle it comes in. I'm an esthetician and know how you can contaminate your products by putting your fingers into a container! Well I am a pretty tuff critic because I have used a lot of exspensive spa line products because I'm in the esthetic indusrty. I have to say that the smell of total effects is very light and pleasant and not at all potent. The texture of the cream is silky smooth and is not to watery or to heavy on the skin. It absorbs nicely and gives your skin a smooth hydrated feeling! I notice a slight tint to the lotion which is probably what gives my skin a nice glow! Love all the high quality performance ingredients in total effects. My skin tone looks much more even and hydrated since using it, I have a healthy looking glow and my fine lines seem a bit smoother. Although I haven't noticed much toning in my jaw line which I was hoping for! I am very happy with this product and I told my husband how much I was loving this product and he had got me total effects as a stocking stuffer! Show now I get to continue to take care of my skin thanks to olay total effects! Mayb now that I will be using it for an even longer period of time I may see even more results! Oh and love the price for such a high quality moisterizer! Thanks Olay for giving me the opportunity to try this great product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Definitely recommend trying this product! So..... I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer for about three weeks. I use it every morning after my shower to moisturize my face. I have never tried an anti aging product before, and wasn't sure what to expect. I started out just applying, and not really giving it a second thought. The first week, I noticed a subtle evening of skin tone. The second week it became more pronounced. Now at the end of week three, I am noticing that my sun spots are fading, and that my skin is looking fabulous, smooth and even. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I see the difference!! Well, I must say, I really do think that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has changed the appearance of my face for the better. My face has a softness and a bit more of a glow to it and do I say that I think my fine lines around my eyes are less!! It will be interesting to see in a few months or so how much more of the fine lines are gone. The seven benefits in one product claim to intensely moisturize skin, reduce wrinkles, enhance skin tone and color, minimize pores, provide free-radical defense, and lift skin. I am seeing a few of these benefits and hopefully will see more with continued use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Soft Smooth Since starting Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I have noticed a visible difference. I have less redness and more even tone now than 5 weeks ago. I also have smooth skin. I do not notice any fewer wrinkles or fine lines. I do not notice a difference in firmness. Overall, I am happy with this product and recommend it to those who want a light moisturizer with a pleasant fragrance, I especially recommend it to those wishing to improve their skin tone. I love the convenient one pump dispenser and how the product smooths onto skin nicely and totally with no residue. It absorbs well and is not oily at all!

Olay 7 In One Anti- Aging Moisturizer I was very excited to be able to give this moisturizer a try. Unfortunately... after applying it sparingly to my face and neck as the directions state I ended up having a bad reaction to it. It caused some red blotches and appeared to clog my pores. I suspected this to be the cause because after I stopped using it within a couple days my skin cleared up in the areas where I had started to break out and have red blotches appear. I don't blame or want to talk negatively about this product. These things just happen sometimes and I would still use and potentially purchase had the results turned out on positive side.

"moisturizing and affordable For the last couple of weeks, Ive had the opportunity to test the Olay Total Effects 7 in one anti-aging moisturizer for free thanks to BzzAgent. I LOVE this moisturizer. This moisturizer claims to: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles Evens skin tone appearance Enhances brightness Minimizes the look of pores Visibly reduces age spots Restores firmness Replenishes moisture Ive definitely noticed by skin looking and feeling better but the most important thing for me is that this has kept my face moisturized during the current harsh winter. Its affordable and it works! A definite must buy! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Still not done with it So far, so good! I am still using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. So until my final result, I wont give it a five star. But its a solid four anyway! This product and Olay in general is beyond a dream come true for women. My skin is smoother, softer, and yes younger. The lines are beginning to fade and my crows feet are starting to diminish. I am happy to say you have found a permanent buyer who will swear by this product! I cant thank bzzagent and olay enough for giving me this product for FREE!

this product does everything it says it will I have used oil of olay since I was in my 20's. The regenerist line has done great things for my skin. it keeps it smooth and moist. I use it morning and night. It is one product that actually lives up to its reputation. I will never use any other brand. I love olay. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Heaven sent! This cream is almost perfect! It leaves my skin so soft, and bright, and so perfect looking! No more rough dry patches, this cream smoothed my skin out in a matter of days! My only complaint is the smell. It reminds me of my mother, and it makes me feel old. Maybe a lighter, fresher scent would be better. Other than that Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 is perfection! I don't have any age spots, or wrinkles, but the transformation in my complexion and skin tone is phenomenal. It is so light, and not greasy at all. I am ever so thankful to Bzzagent for sending me this wonderful magic cream in exchange for my review! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Anti-aging moisturizer wins me over I turned 30 a few months ago and thought it might be time to start using an anti-aging moisturizer but didn't really want to spend money trialing one. Good thing I didn't have to. Bzzz agent managed to read my mind and offered me this campaign. I have been using Olay anti-aging moisturizer for a few nights now and it smells great and makes my skin feel silky smooth. Thanks Olay and thanks bzzz agent for sending me this gem for free so that I don't get more wrinkles, stressing over which moisturizer is best for me. Now I just have to make sure the product is affordable before I start using it on my own..... This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Never too early to start the anti- aging regime! I'm only 28, however skin care is important at any age. There are many pros to this product. I feel that it was gentle on my skin, and didn't leave any big build-up. Still feels clean. In the small supply I had I did notice that it improved the texture of my skin. For the dry winter months it was a great moisturizer. However with my oily completion in the summer I could see it being too oily, and causing blemishes. I would try the fragrance-free and see if that might be a better choice for the summer months. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I didn't notice much difference, but its a great light- weight moisturizer I have been using this product consistently for a few weeks and havent noticed any real improvement or difference in my skin. I did rate this product at a 4 because, in general, its a nice product. I find this product keeps my skin moisturized all day, but its light and fresh. It goes on very smooth and doesnt feel heavy at all. I was really hoping for some better results as far as evening out my skin tone, but I will continue to use the product to see if more time helps. In general, the product is a great day time moisturizer - I have combination skin and really like that it keeps my skin from getting dried out without leaving me greasy.

"Great Moisturizer! I am very grateful to Olay BuzzAgent because I love Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer! I GotItFree to try. While I really haven't noticed any big difference in my skins appearance, I can't blame that on the product. I am lucky enough to age well naturally (people can't believe when I tell them I am 31, or that I am 7 years older then my sister). What I love about this moisturizer is that it doesn't cause me any problems with my oily yet sensitive skin! No breakouts, no rashes, no greasy feeling. Just the right amount is dispensed from the container and it goes on very nicely. Would definitely buy this product again! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Pleasantly Surprised I was skeptical when I first put the cream on. I have tried creams like this in the past every once in a while and never noticed a difference. I have only been using the cream for a week or two (every night before bed) and have noticed that the unique vitamin complex actually helps with my uneven skin tone quite well! I haven't noticed any change with fine lines yet and the moisturizer is a little bit greasy feeling when first applied, but that greasy feeling only lasts a couple of minutes. Overall, I am enjoying this product and would likely purchase it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Test drove during Canadian winter! I had written an earlier review about this product but wanted to just do a quick follow up review. When I had written my first review, we hadn't had a proper winter yet (which is when I usually change moisturizers). I decided to test drive Oil of Olay Total Effects now that the colder weather has set in and see if it would fit the bill. I am happy to report that it passed-with flying colours! The creamy texture spread easily all over my face and kept me hydrated from sun up to sun down. I didn't see a reduction in fine lines or dark spots, but with continued use that may be a possibility. I loved the healthy glow it gave my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a FANTASTIC skin product! I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Moisturizer for about 3 weeks now, and noticed a DRAMATIC difference in my smile wrinkles. I recently started wearing foundation as part of my make up routineI was never a makeup person until a couple months ago, and noticed that my smile lines left a wrinkle when I am not smiling (which is obviously not desired by me). This was my target area for this cream, and I have to say the cream did its job. IT IS AMAZING. Those smile wrinkles are almost non-existent now. I can feel a world of a difference in my face. Overall my skin is smoother, richer, firmer, brighter and glowing! I cannot believe what a difference using the right cream will do to your face! However, there is one thing I would work on with the formula, and that is to make it absorb into the face more easily, because if you do not work it in yourself, you are left with little white clumps of cream that did not absorb. But, that can be solved by working in the cream yourself. By the way, I forgot to mention, in addition to improving my smile wrinkles, the pores on my cheeks and nose were also minimized, which ultimately made this a fantastic product to use because I truly feel years younger :) If you have a smile wrinkle problem and large pore problem, I would really suggest you trying this out and putting it on at bedtime every night, and see if it works for you. I wish I could get more bottles of this stuff! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Easy Makeover I have a few friendsthat have commented on how I look great since I have be losing weight you can really see it on my face. I told them it was not because of losing weight (because I havent) it was because I am using Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer that I had received as a buzz agent. I had been using it now for the past several weeks. I was skeptical but it is awesome,easy pump, smooth, creamy and goes on very nice. At first there is a scent which I did not like but it does disappear. My skin has always been dry, but not now. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Surprised, but pleased I have been looking for a moisturizer that goes on light, has SPF, lasts all day and improves the look and feel of my skin. I was pleasantly surprised after using Olay Total Effects that all those boxes were checked. After a few days I noticed an improvement in the look and feel of my skin. The formula goes on lightly and a little goes a long way. It lasts all day as I wear it under foundation. While it is winter, I spend lots of time outside and I like that it offers sun protection. I feel I need to give the product the full four weeks then review again to see if the unique vitamin complex really fights the seven signs of aging. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I love Olay products! I love all of the Olay products but, being on Social Security, I can't afford to buy them so I ask my daughter and my husband to buy them for me for birthday and Christmas gifts. When people say my skin doesn't look like I'm 66 years old, I tell them to thank Olay. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 Review I used this product alone on my face, at night, until it ran out. I didn't want any other product to skew my review. My skin, especially in the winter, is very dry. Of the seven claims, I'm not sure it holds up to all of them but my skin was certainly very moist and appeared brighter, as it left a nice healthy sheen to my skin. I do think this is a great product. I love the smell as it is a light, clean scent. The consistency creamy but not heavy on the skin. However, it provided enough moisture to my very, dry skin. Overall it was a product I would purchase again and recommend to friends. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"LOVE olay 7 in 1 I received a sample of Olay 7 in 1 moisturizer from BzzAgent over a month ago. I have been using the product and have recently purchased a new bottle, since i loved it so much :) The cream goes on smooth is not greasy and absorbs into the skin quite quickly! The fine lines in the corner of my eyes have diminished and my skin appears brighter more awake and firmer. I have had quite a few compliments from friends family and co-workers about my appearance and the fact my eyes look brighter and my skin looks more refreshed. As I am entering my fourties, i am certainly beaming with pride that I have finally found a cream that certainly lives up to its promise of younger and firmer looking skin! I highly recommend this product to friends and family and any women out there looking for a moisturizer that is easy to use and creates many wonderful benefits! The product is also formulated with numerous vitamins which are certainly an added bonus to Olay's new found freedom to as they say fighting the signs of aging. Unfortunately, aging bodies and skin is one thing we can never control, but thank to Olay's 7 in 1 moisturizing cream - we can slow down the process and look many years younger than our actual real birth age! Try it for yourself you and your face will be glad you did :) Thanks Olay for this amazing cream and to BzzAgent for the opportunity to test and review the product!

I'm impressed I was apprehensive at first but in the end I was impressed with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. My perception of Olay was its something my grandmother would use and I didn't feel like I was old enough to need an anti aging creme. But after using it now for 2 weeks I can see an improvement in my skin. It feels softer and more elastic. We've had a harsh cold snap and using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has definitely helped keep it moisturizer during the winter. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Olay Total Effects 7 Well....even though I still have 2 days left in the campaign my sample size of Olay Total Effects 7 Moisturizer has been used up. I used it daily usually in the morning before putting on my makeup. It adsorbed well. I would buy a full size bottle of this as a moisturizer as I loved that it evened my skin tone and eliminated the dryness in my T zone area. I didn't have any lines so couldn't judge on that. It didn't really do much for my age spots (sun damage spots) however they are a little lighter. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"young looking skin yes you can still benefit! To start off, My face isn't in any deep trouble with uneven skin tone, age spots or major wrinkles, but I have had ever since I can remember forehead wrinkles that have always been there. I thought that they weren't anything I could deal with, boy was I wrong! After a WEEK of using this cream I have noticed a difference. I have been marketed many creams claiming to do the same for literally twenty times the price of this one. I cannot tell you how excited I am that I have found this and it is not a gimmick and a pocket breaker! Does the job, decent price and no sitting through presentations! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Perfect for my Asian Sensitive Brown Skin :) This would be the seventh year that I did not change my moisturizer because this works for my Asian sensitive brown skin. I've tried many moisturizers out there and I am happy that I found the one that matches my skin needs. The only reason for the 4 as overall rating is the price.
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer is AOK I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks now. I have not noticed any anti aging effects, but the cream is light and non irritating. I have been using Olay products for the past decade and am in my late 30's now, people do often don't believe me when I tell them how old I am, perhaps it's genetics, perhaps it's from using olay creams. I would give Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer a 4 out of 5 since it doesn't seem to be making a noticeable difference, but does seem to be a very moisturizing non irritating cream. Which is a bonus. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Another great product from Olay! I got this product to try just before I went on a trip to Cuba and decided it would be the cream to take along and test for 7 days of sun, heat, sweat, water dryness. I am so happy that I took it! I used it twice a day - once in the morning and once in the evening after showering. It is not greasy at all (something I look for in a face product), it soaks in very nicely and it kept me moisturized. I liked how it made my skin feel soft and didn't leave my skin feeling tight. I was a regular user of Oil of Olay (my grandmother swore by it) but I think now, I will be switching to this Olay :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"LOVED it!!!! I am ALL about moisturizers, and even though I'm only 25, anti-aging products and their properties go a long way in long-term skin care. This being said, let me first talk about the packaging. It's an easy dispenser that gives the right amount of product so that you don't overwhelm your skin with an excess. And the travel size is just adorable. If Olay came out with a travel sized product line I would be ALL OVER IT. The smell is great and the consistency is fantastic. I have yet to see long term effects on my skin but I'm sure I would be amazed. All in all, 10/10 product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Someone stole it! This hand cream is so nice that I had it on my desk at work and someone stole it after just two days! Broke my heart a little
This product is an oldie but goodie! I would recommend this product to those who don't have the money to spend on expensive lotions daily facial products. As we all know older we get we start showing signs of our real age. Olay has products for your every day concerns and cares. I've used Olay products off on for years.
"Makes your face feel young Love this product, after using it, it makes my face feel smooth and young looking and it doesn't dry out your skin throughout the day that's what I love about it. I have used other products and about an hour later my face feels dry and it doesn't have the shine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Super skin This product offers a great value for your money and is available most everywhere making not only affordable but super easy to find. The trial size will be in stores by February.....so watch for it I think that olays total effects is totally amazing. The 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer has improved the fine lines around my lips and around my brow bone. I had my first age spot and with consistent application it has all but vanished. With the unique vitamin complex to rejuvenate those lost from everyday lifestyles we are extremely lucky to have Olay products available to us. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Face Makeover I like this cream it goes on really light and does not feel greasy. I have used other Olay products (not anti-aging creams) and did not like them as they were really thick and heavy on my face. I usually double up on my face cream but with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer I dont have to which is awesome. I have less wrinkles and smoother skin and it has tightened up my skin that people tell me I am looking great. My only comment is the scent as it took me awhile to get used to it, but they do offer fragrance free so I would use that in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Early results are promising I was impressed at how smoothly the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer went on my skin. It just glided on. I had a little trouble getting out the amount I needed at first, but have now managed to. I waited a few days to see if I could see a differencein my skin . I pass a mirror in my hallway and have looked closely at my skin in the daylight. It often looked dry and I felt that I should slather on some lotion, but that is not happening now. My skin is much brighter looking and looks smoother because of the moisturizing. Can't wait for the next few weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"It works!! I have been trying Olay Total Effects 7 for several weeks now and have been pleasantly surprised by its effectiveness. The true test for me was that as the cold weather returns, I always have dry red patches near my nose. I have tried countless numbers of creams which never worked. I must admit, I was quite skeptic at first. To my amazement, the patches disappeared and have not returned since! I also noticed how the fine lines near my eyes seem smoother and my overall appearance seems brighter.At one point, my husband told me he noticed my skin looked firmer and smoother. So if other people notice, tnen Olay Total Effects 7 , your work is done! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Light weight moisturizer I do not think I have many fine lines or wrinkles to be worried about yet, and I haven't used it for long enough to notice anything. However, this is a very light weight moisturizer, and being oil free, I think it would be a very nice summer night cream for people in their 30's. For very mature skin, it may not be rich enough. Also, I think it is not rich enough for people with dry skin either. My skin turns dry in winter, and I find myself waking up in the morning feeling my cheeks are not hydrated enough. With that said, I am fairly certain I'll like it in summer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"specialy with sunscreen making it more awesome ! Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti aging mositurizer has unique 7 Aspects . Reduce fine line and age spots ,the necessary thing for an anti agging mostrizer. Special is to even the face skin tone which is the basic problem most of us facing. as well as restores firmness of skin with skin deep moistrizing. On top of that all Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 has SPF 15 ,so no worries for an extra layer of sunscreen, which gives it an Extra point! With all this information about this product i wanted to include it in my daily routine,In my late 30s i am more serious for an Anti Aging routine now , it s Working for me and its Awesome ! Better give it a chance! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Total Effects is a great moisturizer! I have been using this product since I received it about a month ago. I love the SPF because it helps shield my face from the harmful rays of the sun. It truly is a great moisturizer and the vitamin complex in the 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer works! I will be turning 40 next week and my co-workers all guessed that I was still in my late 20's. They are aware that I have replaced my regular moisturizer with Total Effects, but I won't reveal to them my real actual age! Love this and will continue to use it because it helps with fine lines and evens out my skin tone. Most days I don't even put on any foundation, just this lotion and that's it!

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the past few weeks, thanks to BzzAgent igotitfree. I have sensitive skin and I'm always a little bit reluctant when trying a new product. I must say that I really like it. The smell isn't too strong although i do usually prefer unscented products, it goes on smoothly and doesn't leave your skin greasy. Being almost 30 now I am becoming more aware of the little lines and groves in my skin that are starting to form. Now My skin feels more firm, skin tone is bright and my pores are smaller. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes younger, youthful and healthy looking and feeling skin! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So far...really like it...but I still have wrinkles In a face cream, I am looking for something to smooth out the tiny little wrinkles I have, reduce the combination skin issues I have (oily in some places and dry in others) and no residue!! I love the bottle, how easy it is to use, the removal of the top and the amount dispensed. For the product itself, love the feel of it, not a strong smell, no residue on skin and could apply make up almost immediately after. So far it has reduced the oiliness around my T zone and the dryness in my checks, but has not tightened or strengthened my skin or changed the color appearance or reduced wrinkles. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Light and Nourishing My main concern with any moisturizer is whether it causes acne as I have dry-oily combination skin and choosing the right moisturizer can be tricky. After a few weeks of using the Olay Total Effects I'm mostly quite impressed. My skin handled it better than it does Cetaphil, and that's supposedly the best for acne-prone skin. I did get a few very tiny white heads a week in, but that may also have been the after effects of sleeping with foundation, so I'm not going to hold it against this product. I also found it very light and quick absorbing so it didn't feel like I had moisturizer on my face for a half-hour like some moisturizers do, but still did the job of nourishing. I felt like my skin looked healthy with even a more notably peachy blush on my cheeks a few weeks into application, but I'm not sure if that was what is meant by the brightening effect Olay 7 in 1 claims to have. I wouldnt say my skin looked brighter, just healthier. I don't have wrinkles so I can't say I noticed any skin smoothing effect either. My only criticism is that the cream is scented. While it smells pleasant, I prefer putting the least amount of chemicals on my face and it makes me worry about the ingredients more than I may have otherwise. Overall, I like the product and would use it again. I would also recommend it to friends. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Absolutely love the hydration! Never oily! My eyes are very sensitive! Every moisturizer I tried made my eyes water. I am 57 years old and my skin needs the hydration and it gets it with Regenerist! It never bothers my eyes and it never feels oily. It makes your skin feel renewed! Love my Oil of Olay! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great product, good value for money Olay Total Effects is a great value for a brand that is easily accessible at a supermarket or drugstore. I used this in place of my regular moisturizer for a week, and was pleased with the results. I have fairly sensitive skin, so I'm always a little nervous that new products will make me break out. This moisturizer did not cause any problems for my skin. It was not greasy - it felt clean and my skin was noticeably moisturized after use. As a woman in my mid-30s, I have started to seek out products to help with fine lines, and Olay Total Effects did help with those concerns. Olay is a well-known brand that is accessible to everyone. I would purchase this again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Skin going Strong! I am turning 30 in a couple months and this campaign could not have come at a better time because I told myself I really need to take better care of my skin and get into a good routine. I am new to skincare but this moisturizer looks like it could really pack a punch especially with its unique vitamin complex helped to fight the seven signs of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone. I have now been using this cream daily for several weeks and I have noticed my skin tone getting more even and my skin is radiant after I apply it. I really like the bottle with the pump because it lets out the perfect amount for each application. The formula has a faint scent but not bother me in the slightest. I also find that the formula is not at all greasy so my skin drinks it in quickly and I can apply my make up shortly after. The only downside I would have to say it that I wish it was a little bit thicker or I would need to use in addition another eye cream because my skin gets very dry, especially in the winter time and I enjoy using a richer denser cream around my under eye at nighttime. That being said I would definitely use this daily in the morning as my go to cream because I really love using this moisturizer. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has totally exceeded my expectations. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Total Effects 7 Been using this product for just over a week now. Using it morning and before bed. I like how light feels going. I suffer from dry skin so I am always looking for a good moisturizer that keeps my face feeling from feeling dyed out all the time and this product has done the trick for the last week. I feel it is still to early to tell if it helping fight the signs of aging but will continue to use to find out. The one thing I would like to see in this product would be and PHF so you then don't have to think about remembering to out on when your out doors. I believe this is a good moisturizer and would differently recommend to anyone looking for a good moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Nice moisturizer I have always enjoyed Olay products and this moisturizer lives up to the brand. It goes on nice and smooth and you don't need to use very much to cover your entire face and neck. I love that it gets completely absorbed into your skin and doesn't leave you feeling like you need to wipe it off because it's too thick or greasy (my experience with many moisturizers. As for the anti-aging I haven't noticed a difference, that being said I am only 25 and only have minimal wrinkles around my eyes. I will continue to apply it around that area and see if I notice a difference in the next couple weeks! Overall I am very happy with this product and would purchase it again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I actually like this product. I received the Olay 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer from bzzagent. At 25 years old, I don't have a crazy amount of fine lines or wrinkles, but they are definately there. I was excited to try this as my beauty routine is simple and doesn't even usually include a moisturizer. (I know, I'm terrible!) I actually really like this product a lot. Its not greasy or sticky at all and gives me a great base for my foundation. My skin does look noticeably better after about a week or 2. As for fine lines and wrinkles, I'm going to have to try this product for the full amount of time before I can say, but I would definately buy this product even just as a regular moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Hurray for Olay!! I must say I am impressed with the product. I have prior to this that any olay products I have used are a hit and miss for me due to the sensitivity of my skins. One product of a brand may suit me but another may not. So starting with my skepticism I was very pleasantly surprised that I did not break out after using this. It glides on to skin very smoothly and applies perfectly. the absorption is also great. I do find that if I do not use a serum prior to the moisturizer my skin does feel a trifle dry. Despite this I love it and also that the fragrance is mild and not to overpowering. So overall a thumbs up for Olay. Thank you for reviving my trust in Olay.

Great Looking Skin I had the opportunity to try the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for free. What a great product. I loved the scent and how it made my skin feel. the best part is my face didn't feel oily. I am really happy with the results I have been having so far. I find my skin has a brightness to it and coworkers have asked if I have been using something new. I shared with them the product name that I was using. I found that after use the cream has visibly smoothed my fine lines and seems to have restored some firmness. I will continue to use it as I am absolutely sure it will continue to meet my needs. Thank you for this opportunity. gotitfree olay This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Another Amazing Product from Olay I think Olay Total Effects is awesome. I didn't at first because it took a few weeks to start noticing a difference. I like that it was a light moisturiser that I did not feel on my face once applied. It doesn't have much of a scent which is great and you need very little. I started noticing a difference after about 2-3 weeks and that is also when I started getting compliments from friends and family on how young I looked and what I was doing to make that much of a difference. I also purchased a full size of this since and use it daily! Thanks Olay! GotItFree This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great Moisturizer Ive been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer every morning as my daily moisturizer for 3 weeks now. Every time I applied my skin feels silky and smooth. As the matter of fact, it has minimize the visibility of my pores. During the 3 week trial I have not notice much difference in the evenness of my skin tone, maybe I have not used long enough. Overall, Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has restore my skins moisture. Finally, it works great under my makeup. I will continue to use to enjoy the benefits of this product This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay magic I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 moisturizer for well over a month, once a day in the morning after I wash my face and apply a serum. The first non-mineral sunscreen I've used that hasn't irritated my skin! Yippee. I'm also very pleased with the formula and how my skin has been looking. It keeps my skin moisturizer without feeling heavy and keeps my skin moisturizer all day. It does take a few minutes to sink in, but by the time I dry my hair in the morning my face is ready for makeup application. No pilling or balling. Usually by mid-day when wearing other SPF lotions I start to see fine lines on my cheeks (from dryness) and sometimes rough patches and enlarged pores, but not with this! The SPF 15 is obviously not high enough for a day in the sun, but it's my new go-to winter/ office daily moisturizer. It's a bit pricey for a drugstore product however, the fact that it's SPF, fragrance-free, actually moisturizing, and has niacinimide and other good skin ingredients make this a buy again product for me One thing I didn't like is packaging because you can't see how much product is remaining. Although I do likeannoying, the pump-style packaging, as it's hygienic and the ingredients aren't exposed to light or air. I've had no trouble with the pump- it dispenses product well and I can control how much product I get get. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Moisturizes and leaves skin soft! Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream is the facial lotion that makes my skin feel deeply hydrated and fresh each day.

"Love that it's not oily I haven't used Olay products in awhile because they used to be quite oily, thick and the smell reminded me of my grandma. Pleasantly surprised that the Total Effects is hydrating and not oily at all. Best part is the fragrance is completely different from the previous products I've tried and it's only lightly scented. I use Total Effects before bed and the absorption is good my skin doesn't feel overly oily in the morning. My skin however, does feel a little sticky initially after I put it on not sure if it's because I used too much. Been using this for almost 2 weeks and haven't seen visible results on smoothing of fine lines and wrinkles. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Absorbs quickly and i like the scent I am always worried about creams causing my skin to break out with acne or feeling to heavy. Well to my surprize this cream is very light-weight and absorbs very quickly. It has a nice light scent to it which I do enjoy. I have been using it at night and also under my makeup as a base,which it seems to work well as also. I notice my skin is moisturized and more glowing and soft. I think I would have to use It longer than a week to see more results. But I will most likely be buying it so I can use it for a longer period of time to get all the anti-aging results.

"Glowing for the Holidays This Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer came just as my other private label brand face cream ran out. I usually find myself buying higher end face care products so I was hesitant about switching to a less expensive brand. So far I've been pleasantly surprised. The cream is the perfect texture, not too heavy or greasy and a little bit goes a long way. It has a subtle glow to it to which is nice, especially in the winter months when the sun disappears. I am prone to breakouts especially when I switch face product brands but so far my skin has stayed bump free. The cream also has a nice light fragrance, not too strong or heavy. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Surprised in a good way! I must say I was a little apprehensive to try is product as over the years had heard that Oil Of Olay puffs out your skin. I also have very sensitive skin so I wasn't sure how my face would react. I was surprised after applying it how moisturizer my skin felt and by the end of the day it still felt that way. The other good thing was that I had no reaction! I also found that it did give my skin a slight glow, which is important this time of year when you feel pale. It also helped with the wrinkles around my mouth making them less pronounced. Overall I would say that I would buy this product again. Well done! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7in1 Anti Aging Moisturizer Im on my third week of using 'Olay Total Effects 7in 1Moisturizer 'and I have seen great improvement on my skin. I use it in the morning as my daytime moisturizer. What I love about it is that it doesn't have the greasy feel when you apply it. I feel that it keeps my face moisturized all throughout the day. Prior to using it, some areas of my face used to be dry and flaky but on my 2nd week I noticed a big improvement. However, as for my fine lines I haven't seen much improvement. Im thinking maybe I should use it a bit longer to see better results. I received the 15ml bottle and I think it would last me another month or so. Overall, I think its a good product for women my age. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Moisturizer :)) Thanks for letting me try this cream. I love anything that allows me to feel and look younger, for free or for a price I can afford. Since using this cream I have been pretty impressed. I have the type of skin (very dry) that requires cream after every wash, i have been picky with the kind of creams I use, some way to greasy and some I break out, and of coarse some are just way to over priced. My face feels perfect right now, clean fresh and not oily at all, also this cream smells good :). For a cream that is not going to break the bank, I would totally recommend trying this cream as it's different than the kinds I have used in the past, and can be found at a good price.

"TOTAL-LY EFFECT-IVE I absolutely love the Olay brand, and this product definitely makes me love it even more. I've been using this moisturizer for about a month now and I see so many amazing changes within my skin. I've noticed that there is less fine lines around my forehead, eyes, and mouth, I've also notices that the pores around my nose and forehead appear much smaller which was definitely my problem area. Although I don't have many sings of aging, I've always believed that working to fight them before hand makes the battle that much easier, and so with using this product I'm sure to be able to achieve my end result!

Smooth silky I have used Olay products many years ago but due to my acne-proned skin I started using products specifically for that. Now that my acne is under control I wanted to go back to using a more affordable and easy to find product. Having the opportunity to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer was perfect timing. I still use my special acne products at night but use Olay in the morning. I love how light and smooth it goes on. The only dislike is I would prefer a non-perfume cream. The unique vitamin complex has helped even my skin tone and I find I don't worry about using foundation anymore. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Awesome cream! I've only been using the cream for a couple weeks now but I'm already starting to feel my skin become smoother. I did not see any difference in my age spots or skin tone yet. I was shocked with the silky feeling of the cream as I put it on my face the first time, what a great feeling cream! I have acne issues, dry and oily skin as well as the beginning signs of aging so finding a cream that helps with one issue and doesn't make my other issues worse is difficult to find... Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has moisturized my skin and made my skin noticably smoother without affecting my other skin issues! I will be buying this product and highly recommend it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good moisturizer! I've used Olay since I was a teen, starting with their moisturizer with spf. Now that I'm in my 30s, it's time to amp up the routine with Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I used this for a few weeks on my neck and have noticed my necklace lines becoming slightly fainter and my neck feeling well moisturized. The unique formula definitely helped the signed of aging and I noticed my skintone evening out and any hyper pigmentation spots fading away. Since it's an anti-aging product, I feel I will need to give it a bit more time to really reap the full benefits. But so far, it's a good start! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This product is really good . Since I started to use this product, I really feel good in my skin because I use the soap, body wash, cleanser and regenerist cream. I tell my relatives to buy and use the Olay products, because I feel it in my face. Everyone in my family use this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Softer, Glowing Skin! I have been using this for the past few weeks. I love the lotion, it goes on so nicely, and you definitely do not need a whole lot to cover your whole face. I usually do half of a pump and it is covers all of my face with a bit on my neck. The only thing that I don't like, but its not enough to change my rate is there is a bit of a scent to it. It is not a horrible scent, but I just don't like scented face lotion. I have noticed a difference in the softness of my skin, and it seems to be more rejuvenated and not so dry....which is nice in the winter time! So far, I am loving this product and look forward to be able to start to see more results and changes! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Moisturizer left skin red I really like this moisturizer. It smells lovely and did make my skin feel and look better. However, I used this mostly at nighttime after I washed my face. I found when I woke up in the morning my face, right out to my hair line where I would rub the lotion in, was slightly pinkish-red. I did stop for a couple of days to see if it would go away and it took no time to fade, but once I started using again it did the same thing. I would put my make-up on in the morning (trying to hide or fade the redness), it covered okay, I could still see some of the redness under though. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Truly remarkable!!!! I think this is a fantastic product. I tried it for seven days and then broke out with severe acne. I do tend to have somewhat sensitive skin however I still continued using the product and eventually my skin got used to it and The acne cleared up. I really do enjoy the smell of this product I tend to go with fragrance free options but in this case it's such a subtle fragrance and it's really enjoyable. The cream is not too thick and not too thin, it's really the perfect consistency and it leaves your skin feeling smooth and well hydrated. After using it for months now I have noticed visibly reduced fine lines on my face it really is a miracle cream! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay 7 in 1 I think that this moisturizer is ok so far. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and have not noticed a huge change but I am hoping in the next few weeks to see more. It is a really nice light weight not greasy great smelling cream. It dries quickly and does not leave a greasy film on my skin. I have not yet noticed any change in the fine lines on my skin but skin is on a 52 day cycle so I should notice change closer to the 52 days. I also would say that it is a nice small sized amount you use not a large amount like some products so a regular size bottle should last a decent amount of time. I am sure the trial size is going to last me awhile longer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Totally Effective My opinion on the Olay Moisturizer is that it's quite good. I have very dry flaky skin on my face so for that reason only I probably wouldn't purchase this product unless I can remedy that first. That being said I would recommend this to all my female friends and family. A little product goes a long way and with a dime size squirt covered my whole face and neck. It did feel very moisturizing. As for anti aging effects I would have to look at it long term. For someone with normal to slightly dry skin this cream would work wonders. It seems to be at a very affordable price point and has no strong scent. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Wonderful Nighttime Moisture for All Ages Olay is such a classic brand. This moisturizer works well, and definitely leaves my skin feeling nourished. For my combination skin, this is a nighttime product since makeup would not sit well over top. (It probably works even better on dry skin!) I did not notice major results from this moisturizer, since I already have a pretty active skincare routine - salicylic acid, lactic acid, tea tree oil. I prefer mild products since I have sensitive skin, and I know that my grandmother is a huge fan of this facial moisturizer in the fragrance free version. A little goes a long way, and be sure to keep it capped so that the product doesn't dry out in the pump to create a clump! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer This cats' curiosity was satisfied thanks to a free trial sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer that I was given in exchange for my honest feedback of the product. I really wanted to try I surely had at least 4 of the seven signs of aging ! The unique vitamin complex is said to help with that ,I am glad now i did! I love Olay products especially the original body wash and moisturizer they are wonderful! I have hesitated lately spending money because of disappointment and waste when I get it wrong. On receiving my sample of Olay Total Effects 7 I immediately opened the package,and took a sniff , the scent was clean and light, the lotion creamy soft to the touch,the pump easy to use. That can be very helpful when your hands are wet or you have arthritis. I washed my face ,rinsed in cool water,gently dried my face then applied as directed the Olay Total Effects 7. I enjoyed the way it spread easily ,very little went a long way,fully disappearing leaving behind softer skin with no film. After a few days I began to notice some improved tone ,smoother lines and less dryness. Two weeks later there is still more improvement to all areas,even my husband noticed,new makeup lol Nope I intend to purchase a full size in order to get the full experience . I am really loving it so far and feel good spending my precious money on something that gives results. Go Olay! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"If you want moisture... I have been a user of Olay products for a while the Regeneration line being a personal favorite. I was expecting that same type of product in the Total Effects line. I love the feel of the lotion. It is thick, and smooth, and goes on nice and evenly. I have very sensitive skin, and didn't have the least bit of reaction to the elements of this lotion. After using it for a few days, I felt like I had over lotioned, and my skin started to feel a bit greasy, even after washing my face twice daily. I think that in drier climates, and certainly during the colder winter months, this would be an excellent moisturizer, but I'm not sure that I would ever use it in the summer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer works! I've been using this moisturizer for a few week now and I'm really seeing a difference in my skin. It is smoother and fine lines appear to be smaller. I think a good moisturizer is important, especially since we are now into the winter months and I think this Olay product has paid off. I have an annoying age spot on my cheek and even that is starting to look better. This is a great product. My only criticism is the smell which I don't like. I am especially sensitive to scents and the smell of this product turns me off. For most people I think it would be fine but for me it's a negative. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Happy Skin When I receive my sample I was excited to start using it right away. I have been using it for over 2 weeks now, and I am happy with the results. I have combination skin so heavy creams aren't right for me. This is nice and light and non greasy, which makes sure my skin isn't greasy. I use it every morning and it leaves my skin nice and soft and moisturizer all day. It has diminished the look of my fine lines a bit. My skin is left a bit more even toned and pores aren't as visible. I am happy with this lotion and will remain using it until done to see if their are any more results after even longer use. I will most likely purchase this product after my sample runs out. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
the best face lotion! This is the best lotion for deep hydration! My skin feels so smooth after applying it in the morning. But the 2 best features are: it does not clog my pores it has never caused an allergic reaction (which is why this is the only lotion I use on my face!)

"I use it day and night I have been using the product for 6 days now and although I was skeptical I have to be honest and actually am really enjoying how my skni is looking. I am a product junkie but usually when it comes to skin creams I am loyal to the Lancome brand. I usually swear by Lancome visionnaire and have been using it religiously and love the results. However when I was given the tester to try I did not think I would love it and thought to myself I will give it a fair trial ad then go back to Lancome. My first day I put it on after my shower and immediately did not like the thickness of the cream. I thought to myself - no big deal let's see how it stands the test of the rest of the day. To my surprise I noticed my skin looked softer and the dry spots I had around my nose were gone. After the next few days a friend of mine mentioned that my skin was glowing and asked me what product I was using. Fast Forward to 6 days later and I think I will retire my Lancome products and give my wallet a break and switch to Oil of Olay 7 in 1 anti aging Moisturizer. I am a convert and can't stop looking at my skin. It has not looked better. I use it in the morning and right before bed in the evening. My skin is smooth, the under eye wrinkles have diminished and I feel as thought I look refreshed. I don't Even notice the thickness of the cream anymore. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay is definitely okay Great product, although not typically not my usual preference, I think I would continue to use for the following reasons: gave me a great refreshing look, a more even skin tone, minimized my dark circles, definitely gave me moisture back, I usually get dry skin regardless the product I use, but this product stayed longer then most moisturizers I use, also felt like it minimized the size of my pores on my face... I would recommend for the general audience who have a more tired looking face it definitely boosts your look and gives u a glow by giving you the moisture back, also bonus points for even skin tone and putting firmness back in your face. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Visible Results My skin can be sensitive and react with a burning sensation if products are overly scented. Olay total effects does not have an overpowering scent. So right of the bat it was OK to use on my skin. I have been using the cream on my face every morning and some nights (not all). My skin is prone to dryness in the winter, but I have had no dryness since using this cream. I have noticed that my complexion is looking more even than it did before., and my skin feels smooth. I will probably buy this cream in the future as it seems to work well for my skin, and does not make it oily or greasy. I am surprised to see results in such a short period of time! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Trial is great intro The trial size is a great way to try out this product to see if you like it. I like Olay products and was excited to try this one. I think if you are serious about seeing the results stated, you need to continue to use as I saw softer skin and possibly softer fine lines but I used all the product after 2 and half weeks. Would liked to have tried it longer to see if the results were more pronounced after a longer period of time. I noticed my skin was nicely moisturized while using the product and when I stopped it was noticeably drier than when I began. I think my skin got used to it and is in a bit of shock now that I have stopped. I would recommend to family and friends to see the results over the long term. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Make a great first Impression! I have been using the Olay moisturizer for about 2 weeks now, and I am so far pleased with it. It goes on very easily, nice and smooth. What I worried about the most is that it would leave a greasy feel or look to my face and this product definitely does neither of those. When the colder weather comes my face tends to get very dry and I have a hard time finding something to help with this, so far as this Olay product puts moisture back in my face and have noticed my dryness is gone. I have also noticed my lines reducing and my skin tone much more even. I will continue to use this product and hope it continues to work as well as it is so far! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"After finishing the product.. Well I finished the sample product.. and immediately went out to buy a full size! I was pleasantly surprised to find there was an unscented version of this, as the perfume was really the only thing that bothered me. So after finishing the trial it was about 4 weeks, unfortunately I have to say all my fine lines aren't as different as I had hoped they would be, HOWEVER the unique vitamin complex has definitely helped even my skin tone, I have much softer skin, and I just absolutely love this cream. As I've said before goes on light, feels immediately dry and soft after applying. Still for sure hoping for more reduction of fine lines, but this product is definitely staying in my daily routine either way! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"2 weeks in.. I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 product for about 2 weeks now. I'm anticipating I will see more of a difference after the 4 weeks as stated by the product, and I'm very hopeful! As far as the 'unique vitamin complex' that is fighting the seven signs of aging goes, my main concerns are fine lines and reducing appearance of pores! I haven't noticed much of a difference in this respect - yet! I've only just started with the product. However my skin is very sensitive and picky and so far this moisturizer has been wonderful. The only thing I will say - and this is just a personal preference - is that it seems very perfume-y! Now keep in mind, with my sensitive skin I usually go the unscented route, so it's probably not even that perfume-y, I'm likely just not used to it. I also wear a mask at work, so for the first half of the day I'm directly inhaling it - haha! By the afternoon there isn't much scent left which is nice for me. As far as just compared to any moisturizer I love how light it feels putting it on and throughout the day, not thick or sticky or anything, instantly dry - for this reason alone (regardless of how much it ends up helping with the anti aging) I'm already planning on buying the full size of this product to add to my regular routine!

One Month of Using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer After one month of using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I am a fan! I'm almost done my trial size and it's on my list to purchase. I see that it comes in a form that includes sunscreen so I'm even more of a fan now! Prior to using this I always used plain vitamin E cream. It worked well but I see fine lines creeping up when I look very closely in the mirror. My face feels great when I wear the Olay and I love how light it feels and it absorbs so quickly compared to my old cream. I'm fairly red skinned and find that my redness isn't as pronounced now. I'm not one to spend a fortune on skin creams because my skin is relatively good so the price is just at my high end of what I would buy. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great moisturizer I feel like this is a fantastic product. It has worked well on my dry skin (I do still use my serum underneath). I feel like it has improved the texture overall. I first tried the product only on my forehead to make sure I wasn't sensitive to it. After a week of the trial, I used this on my whole face. I did find it a bit greasy as I am used to gel moisturizers. It is very gentle and lightweight. I could easily apply at bedtime and go straight to bed without feels like a sticky mess. I don't know if I would purchase this again as I feel I need a better suited moisturizer for my cold and dry winters in Canada. This might be a great summer purchase. Overall I liked the feel of it on my face and I did notice a bit of improvement in the texture of my skin This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"An Impressive Moisturizer I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer consistently now for about 4 weeks and can honestly say that I am quite impressed with it. I know for sure that my skin looks brighter and is well moisturized. I even had a comment from a friend who I haven't seen in weeks. She said that my skin looks great and it looks like I had a good night's sleep. However, I haven't seen a reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles around or between my eyes and mouth or a reduction in the size of my pores. I will continue to use it until it is all gone and may even buy another bottle when it becomes available in 2016, just to see if I can see more improvements to my skin. I have a few freckles or age spots on my cheeks and I haven't seen them lighten either. Overall though, I do like the moisturizing effect of Olay and the fact that it absorbs into my skin quickly in the morning before I put on my foundation and in the evening before going to sleep. I would still recommend Olay to others saying that it is a good all-round moisturizer and if I see a difference in the next few weeks or after using a second bottle, I will extol the virtues of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer to anyone who will listen!

"Keeps me looking younger I have used this for many years now. My skin is sensitive and many products irritate it, but I can trust that the cream is safe for my skin and won't dry it out or make it blotchy. I know it works because I am 56 and most people think I am only in my 40's! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My skin is so smooth and youthful! So I've been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks now and I can honestly say I don't think my skin has felt so smooth and soft in a while! My complexion is much more youthful now and the few lines that were starting to appear around my mouth and eyes are practically gone! I'm so impressed with this product that I have recommended it to all of my friends and family! My sister commented the other day that I must be getting a lot of rest lately because I don't look like my usual tired self from working full-time and taking part-time distance courses, to which I replied that I had only made one little change, the Olay moisturizer! She was pretty impressed and is already scouting out where she can get her own bottle! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Good product Works well. Does what it says. Too expensive. Though. Not everyone is rich.
"Not too bad.... I was super excited to try the Oil of Olay 7 in 1 anti aging, i have a few dark spots on my face that i have been trying for years to get rid of, with no luck i must say! I have tried several creams that say they brighten your face, ect,.... and nothing works. Its been about month since i started using this, and i can honestly say i do see and feel an amazing difference with my face. It has a nice light scent, absorbs nicely into my skin, and doesn't leave my skin feeling oily after i put it on. I can say that yes, i have seen my face brighten up and the dark spots have faded some what. I feel that if i continue the routine every day, that i will see the full results of my dark spots fading away! I really do like this cream! Thank-You Bzzz agent!

"youthful feelings. I am a bzz agent and mostly get the chance to try new product which I have not try before, recently when I sign for the new campaign of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I was curiously waiting for it to come. I would really like to tell the effects on my skins,I liked the way it made my skin feel. Soft and smooth, not greasy. I trusty Olay because they have been around forever and their products usually work. After using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer , I always get compliments on how my skin looks great, even when I have no make-up on whatsoever. I turned 38 last year, and it is awesome to have such young looking skin by using this products. it shows its results in days u don't have to wait for months :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay after 2 weeks I've been using this product for the last two weeks since I received it. The first week, I was applying it at night as a bedtime moisturizer to see what effects if would have on my skin the following morning. It did make my skin feel tighter, but in the first week I didn't notice any improvement in skin tone, age spots or fine lines. It did, however, cause a few breakouts. By the second week, I switched it to a morning day moisturizer, to see if the effects would change. By the second week I think my skin was more used to a new product and I have not had anymore breakouts, my skin feels smooth and silky and I do notice my skin tone evening out. I look forward to see what week 3 brings. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A TotOlay complete Classic Olay continues to be a classic for good reason. Their products always stand up to the reputation of a brand that you can rely on. Here are some of the reasons why I enjoyed using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. The pump dispenses just the right amount of product. The light scent of the moisturizer is refreshing and not over-powering. My skin feels hydrated and fresh all day long. My skin looks brighter and feels smoother. I have very dry skin on my nose and this time of year is worst for me with the cold dry weather. My skin felt great, not tight at all. I really enjoyed using this moisturizer and I would consider adding it to my current skin care regimen. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great cream! I've always seen this mositurizer in the stores, but never tried it bc it was a bit pricy for not knowing how it would work.... When this campaign came up I jumped at the chance to try! It's great! the cream smells nice and isn't overpowering. It goes on smooth and a small amount covers my whole face, which is nice... Lasts longer! I didnt notice fine lines or age spots disappear but I think overall my skin has evened out. I think with continual use, it may do what it says! That's exciting. Now that I see how long the cream will last, I'm seeing the value in the higher price. Overall. I would recommend it. I've bought another bottle to get ready for when my trial size finishes! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"fantastic all in one This a great moisturizer. It is in a easy to use pump bottle that dispenses only the exact amount that you need. No waste or unsanitary finger dipping. Packaging looks great. There is only a subtle, tolerable fragrance. I actually really like the smell, smells clean. The product itself is non greasy, easy to apply, its absorbs slowly (you need to really rub it in), and goes on with minimal effort. The results are almost instant. My larger pores minimized before my eyes, my skin texture was smoother making my makeup application flawless. Having acne prone, sensitive skin I was worried about inflammation and redness, it actually calmed my redness and did not cause further breakouts. I can't really comment on the moisturizing aspect as i use a serum underneath any moisturizer, but i can stay it didn't cause any flaky or visible dryness. My only con is that its awfully thick. I prefer a gel type face cream which lathers on easily. I would definitely purchase this item, again in the handy trial size, as it does not take up a lot of counter space and easy to travel with. There is a lot of added bonus in the vitamins, SPF, etc, which is fantastic for your skins aging process. Love this stuff and its a great addition to my morning routine.

Great Moisturiser for Daily Use! I received the trail size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer in the mail. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now. I love that it has a pump to dispense the perfect amount each time reducing waste! I have not noticed much difference in my skin tone but it did leave my skin moisturized throughout the whole day which is something my current moisturizer did not do. I did not notice that it reduced any of my fine lines or reduced the look of age spots but it did make my skin appear brighter and minimized the look of pores. I am looking forward to continuing with this trial and see if it helps with anything else. Overall so far I think its a great moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great Moisturizer...not sure of other effects I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about a month now and I do like it. The texture is nice, not watery but not too thick or creamy either. It hasn't made me break out which some creams can do. I do find it nicely moisturizing, especially in this winter weather which can often dry my skin out like crazy, but I haven't found that happening this year! It does have a strong perfume-y scent, so I will be purchasing the Fragrance-Free version as I can't take the smell. As regards the other benefits touted by Olay, I'm really not sure I see them happening. Overall a good moisturizer for a good price. A friend noticed my skin was better and not as dry so she went out and bought the full size to try herself :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
So much moisture! This is an exception product. I have tried so many moisturizers that leave my skin feeling like I haven't moisturized at all. But Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream really does the job with leaving any oily/greasy residue on my skin - I love it! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Notice a difference in my fine lines and wrinkles. I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about 2 weeks now. I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin. Also any fine lines or wrinkles. Under my eye there has been some fine lines. The moisturizer seems to have lessened or diminished the appearance of my fine lines. I also like the smoothness and radiancy of my skin. I do notice a difference and would recommend others to try it. This is the first time I have ac. noticed a visible difference with a moisturizer. It goes on light and non-greasy. My skin feels light and airy. Finally if you are looking a quality product that ac. does what it says. Then this mosturizer is for you. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"First impressions I've been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for almost a week now. I use it morning and night on clean skin, as indicated and have found it to be hydrating and it has left my skin smooth and moisturized. I like that it absorbs well and doesn't affect my make-up application in the mornings. It doesn't leave the skin tacky and smoothes in right away. As for the promises it makes, after only the first week I can see how smoothing it could be to someone who has a lot of fine lines. I still haven't seen an improvement on dark spots or a more even skin tone, but I assume that will take a little more than a week to take effect. Overall, this moisturizer so far performs as well and even better than much pricier options. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"my experience I've used Olay total effects for a while now, and have noticed pretty good results. I loved the pump style packaging - made for just the right amount of product each time and no waste. I noticed that the product gave my skin a nice glow and i felt it made my skin look brighter. It absorbed nicely into my skin and didn't make my skin break out. I believe it made my skin look more even and well hydrated .. I had hoped that it would lighten my age spots on my face but so far i haven't seen a difference in them .

"I'm seeing results! I have been using Oil of Olay now for two weeks and I am seeing the results! I am not a regular make up wearer so my pores are exposed to the elements daily. As I age, my skin shows larger pores and some dryness. This product has evened out my tone, reduced the size of my pores and moisturized my face perfectly! I feel fresh faced and younger! There is no sticky residue and the smell is light and pleasant. The small bottle fits nicely into my overnight bag and takes up minimal space in my medicine cabinet where I keep my daily must-haves. With the cold weather approaching I'm glad to have found a multi-purpose product to keep my face hydrated as well as younger looking. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Helps with the fine lines I have used it daily for over a week now and I like the results so far. I am middle aged, so the wrinkles and fine lines are there but the do seem less deep and my skin feels more hydrated. The product has a slight but pleasant scent which was not strong enough to irritate my skin, but could do if you have really sensitive skin. Because my skin is so dry I am used to slathering on the lotion, I didn't have to do this with the Olay, and I liked the pump because a little does go a long way. I will say that it does leave a film after applying, this isn't a bad thing but it is something I noticed. All in all I do like the product and will buy it when it comes on the market.

"What moisturizer do bullfighters use Olay! .... this is definitely not just for bullfighters. After only a couple days of using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I've already noticed an enhancement in my skin tone, complexion, and overall feel of my skin. Although I'm only 27, I have been following a skin care regimen since my teens - including cleanser, toner and moisturizer everyday. I have combination skin - dry in some areas, while oily around my T zone. The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has a wonderful texture. It is quickly absorbed, and not at all greasy. It doesn't add any oiliness to my skin, but it relieves the dried out patches around my nose and mouth. I haven't noticed any change to my pore size, but that's never been a concern of mine. I can vouch for the fact that this cream brightens my skin, and evens the tone while moisturizing and firming. I'm not sure who would be interested in purchasing such a small container of moisturizer, as I go through products like this quickly and would prefer buying more such that it'd last longer. I suppose it would be good for travel or to try it for the first time, yet personally I'd go for the larger size. At the end of the day, it's a good product and seems to live up to its 7-in-1 claim!

Olay moisturizer leaves your skin feeling great! So I was a bit skeptical before trying this product. First of all I am not one to use moisturizers as in the past they haven't really worked and secondly anti aging was something I refused to think I needed to use. But I thought why not give this product a chance it won't hurt. After using this moisturizer I was impressed as I noticed a positive change in the way my skin felt. My skin was left looking brighter and my pores were not so noticeable. The moisturizer did not leave my skin feeling greasy which I was very happy with. As for smoothing fine lines and wrinkles and reducing age spots I can't really speak to that as I do not have any. I am glad I tried this product and will continue using it as it has worked wonders on my face. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Effective product, I noticed a difference! Right away after the first use i noticed the skin on my neck and face was softer and smoother. There is definitely a plumping agent in this product, which i liked. I have a few fine lines around my mouth and eyes and it lessened them enough that i noticed. I used it for a week straight for a day cream and enjoyed it until it started to make my face a bit red. I continued to use it on my neck for the rest of the 4 weeks and it did not bother the skin on my neck at all. My face can be a bit sensitive and as soon as i stopped using it on my face, the skin was no longer red. Overall, I really enjoyed this product, the texture, even the scent didn't bother me but it is definitely heavily scented. An unscented option would be great.

"Good for what it is, but not what I need right now Because it just got cold here in Windsor Ontario this week and just began snowing this weekend, my skin is crazy itchy! I use Eucerin on a normal basis and have even had to consult a dermatologist for medicated creams. Although I like this product, it is not what I need for the winter. I have used it all weekend in addition to my normal routine, but it probably won't replace anything I currently use. I do like the smell though. It is not overpowering. This is good because I work in a scent-free environment. The consistency is also great and the pump is easy to manage. I apply it to my t-zone in the morning after showering, mainly on my nose which gets the driest. I did not love having to pick this product up at the Purolator depot.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer I have only been using Olay's Total Effects Moisturizer for a little over a week but so far, I am pretty impressed. It goes on smoothly and you only need a little bit of product as it goes a long way. Upon immediate use, I found that my skin was much smoother and it provided a nice base for my makeup. I haven't noticed a difference in my fine lines yet but I think it is too early to tell. I can definitely say that my skin tone is much more even and my skin looks hydrated, which is hard to combat with the heating in the house. The only slight issue I have with this cream is the smell. I applied it liberally around my nose area where I had a lot of dryness and the smell was very overpowering. If you keep it away from your nose it's not as bad but I still would prefer a fragrance free option. I think that Olay products consistently have high reviews because they actually do work. I like that this Moistirizer has a vitamin complex and it makes me feel good about using it. I find that it works best when you apply it directly after your shower or washing your face so that it can absorb deeper into your skin. I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I will be sure to give an update once I have used to for a longer period of time. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great product for normal skin I think this is a great product. I was offered to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer for free as a BzzAgent, and I really like it. It helped smooth the fine lines on my face. It lasting moisture for whole day, which is really good for winter. It also helped improve the skin tone and minimize pores, so the skin looks younger and healthier. After finished the product I received from BzzAgent, I feel my skin a little firmer. I think if I keep using this product I may get better result in the future. The other reason I like this product is the price. The price is affordable, but the result is amazing. I think I will stay with this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Anti- aging Olay Total Effects 7in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer is all is claims to be and do it is fantastic . I have extremely dry skin on my face and it is very dull and was not very supple . I have used the Olay moisturizer for two weeks now and I'm can see a difference in the tone of my skin and I have more elasticity to my face skin in and around my eyes , I have not had a problem with dry skin since I started using it , the cream sinks into the skin right away it is so light and silky to the touch and has a very light pleasant fragrance . The fine lines around my eyes are still the same but I think with prolonged use the results will de great . I like this product a lot and totally recommend you try it you won't be disappointed .

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer may be your answer! Thanks to BzzAgent and Olay Total Effects, I had the opportunity to try this for a week and I liked it! However, shortly after I discovered it was too rich for me, and my skin broke out. I was so disappointed. My Mother in law is a long time loyal user of Olay products. So since the product didn't work for me - I gave it to her to use.. it worked great on my MIL (who is 70 by the way). Some of the positive things she had to say.... The lotion goes on smoothly, has a light scent, it made her skin feel good. And the pump was a bonus. I would recommend this for those that are 50+ and for anyone wanting to reduce or help prevent the signs of aging. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"After 4 weeks... I took a photo of my face before starting to use olay's total effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer, and then took another one 4 weeks later to see if I could see a noticeable difference... the product claims a unique vitamin complex fights 7 signs of aging. The verdict I have definitely noticed more even skin tone, enhanced brightness, and minimized pores! I used one pump in the morning and it was more than enough to cover my entire face. I found it took about an hour for the stickiness of the moisturizer to fade, but once it did, my face was left quite soft for the duration of the day. Definitely worth buying just for the extra glow in the face! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great but not as expected When I try a new product on my face, I usually like to wait about 3-4 weeks before I can really judge it, because I have sensitive skin. So I like to see how my face reacts on a long term basis. When I first tried Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I loved the scent, the texture and the fact that after applying I don't have to wait long for it to dry before I can put on makeup. I loved the effect it had on my face, it felt really soft. But maybe because of the name, I expected so much more. And it was just great for me. I expected it to be amazing. But nonetheless, I bought one more tube and am religiously using it every day. After 3-4 weeks, my skin didn't break out which is a big deal. Go for it!

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer I've been using my Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer for 2 weeks now. Previously to receiving this bzzkit, I never would have purchased this product due to the fact that I am very sensitive to moisturizers and lotions. In most cases they cause itching and rashes if I use them on my face so I avoid using them. However, Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer did not cause any itching or rash! I was happily surprised! Besides that, I have also noticed my skin is smoother, and the tone more even. My face doesn't feel dry and my kids have commented that my face looks brighter. All in all I'm very pleased with the results so far. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Feeling Young and Moisturized! I recently received Olay Total Effects Moisturizer and it is absolutely amazing. Love how soft and smooth my skin has been feeling. I use it every night after cleansing and my skin feels fabulous. Even with this cold winter weather we've been having, I haven't had the tightness associated with dry skin. Feels great and looks just as good. I've also noticed a lot more smoothness and less bumps, wrinkles, age spots. Love this product and will definitely be checking it out in the stores soon - I'm still using my sample as I need very little. It smoothes on the skin so nice and evenly and I only need one small dab (the equivalent of one pump) for my entire face. Definitely worth the buy! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good Moisturizer!! I have been using this moisturizer once a day and haven't noticed a difference in my skin tone so far. I don't have any wrinkles and the really fine lines I do have are under the inner corners of my eyes. I think the slack is naturally there (they didn't show up with age) for closing the eyes so I can't comment about how the moisturizer affects any lines or wrinkles. I do like the feel of it and have a temporary glow after I apply it. It goes on very smoothly spreads nicely where a little dab goes a long way, it absorbs instantly, doesn't feel greasy or heavy and keeps my face feeling soft and looking hydrated for the entire day, the dispenser is great keeping the product clean and dispenses easily so 4 stars for these points. The only thing I don't like about it is that the fragrance is a bit strong for me. I like the scent, but would prefer if it wasn't so strong so I would get the fragrance-free version of this. I only notice the scent for a few seconds of applying it and can only smell it again if I have something around my face like a scarf but I would still get the fragrance-free version - the less chemicals on you, the better! -1 for the strong fragrance. I would continue to use this as a summer, autumn, spring daytime moisturizer but only as an overnight moisturizer during the winter. I think a heavier cream would be better for the winter cold and wind. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Was not sure what to expect When I receive the invitation to this campaign I was excited as I was in the market for a new moisturizer. I have used Olay products in the past but not within the last ten years so my first thought was that this could be a excellent substitute for the expensive high end moisturizer I have been using. The first thing I noticed is that the moisturizer sunk into my skin quickly and did not leave a greasy feel. After about a week I noticed a reduction in the redness/unevenness of my skin and the dark circles under my eyes appeared less dark. I did not see any effect on the fine lines/wrinkles I have. All in all, I would recommend this for people looking for a moisturizer that could help even skin tone. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Olay gets a Yay I just turned 30 this year, and I've kind of been in denial about aging. This is the time when the smile lines don't disappear like they used too, age spots start showing up, and moisturizing becomes more important than ever. Enter the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Total Effects claims to help fight the seven signs of aging with it's vitamin rich formula. I'm not quite at the stage of fighting wrinkles and age spots, but as far as moisturizing, firming and brightening, Olay did as promised. The cream itself is light weight. It doesn't feel heavy or sticky on my skin, nor does it give an unwanted shine. I also found the 'a little dab'll do ya' rule applied as well. I would consider my skin normal to dry, leaning more to the dry side, especially around my nose. I noticed a difference for the better within about 10-14 days. I'm also someone who has post acne scars. Not a lot of them, just mostly from recent pimples that are taking their time to clear up. With Olay I noticed the spots clearing up, my skin tone evening out, and just feeling more fresh faced. Over all I was pretty happy with Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer and will definitely be looking for the trial sized package to add to my travel bag when it hits stores in February!

"Velvety Smooth Skin As someone who has sensitive skin, I was apprehensive to say the least about trying a new moisturizer. After using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for one week straight morning and night, I was blown away with the results! Not only does my skin feel smooth and soft, but it is not oily and I have had no breakouts or blemishes to speak of! After applying the moisturizer my skin feels so smooth, and I really feel as though it glows. I thought that all products at this level were very expensive so I am very excited to find one that will fit into my budget and I do not have to give up on quality to do so. All in all a big thumbs up for Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects I have been using Olay Total Effects for a few weeks now as part of a bzzagent campaign. I have enjoyed using this product. I believe that this product does work well at replenishing moisture. I have dry skin and I found that I only needed to use a small amount to make my skin feel quite soft. I loved that it did not leave my skin feeling greasy. I believe it does work at smoothing fine lines. I feel that it make a difference with the little lines by my eyes, but I am unsure if it would be helpful with deeper wrinkles. I guess it could be helpful over a longer period of time on age spots and wrinkles. I did not mind the scent of this mosturizer, but I would have preferred a scent free product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Fabulous moisturizer I gotta admit, I figured that a moisturizer is moisturizer, boy was I wrong! Olay Total Effects really works! Since I started using the sample 2 weeks ago I my skin is not dry, it really moisturizes. Also, my skin tone is more even and looks creamier and healthier. The only thing I did not see was a shrinkage in pores, but with everything else it does I'm definitely going to keep using it. The trial size is a perfect way to test the product yourself without breaking the bank, but with how wonderful and soft my skin note looks and feels, I'd say you're better off just getting the full size one because you'll end up loving it!

now i see them now ...not so much I so dropped the ball on this trial I really wish I had taken before and after pics because I swear the age spots on my face have gotten much lighter!! I am 45 and noticed age spots on my right cheek about 2 years ago and HATED them they make me very self conscious but I swear after using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I see a real improvement!! Not only are my age spots lighter but my over all skin tone has evened out and my skin is much softer to the touch. I was trying very hard not to get to excited about getting to try this product but I really liked it and will definelty buy it so I can see if the improvement continues I love that the formula is non greasy and unscented This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Awesome product. I have been using Olay total effects 7 in 1 age fighting moisturizer for a couple of weeks now, and I have noticed a nice change in my skin. My complexion has evened out more, my skin does not feel as dry, and it also feels a lot softer and younger. I use it at least once a day when I wash my face, and I really like that it does not leave a greasy residue on my skin. The formula comes out very easily and spreads over the skin very smoothly as well. My only issue with the product is the strong perfume smell that it has. I prefer unscented products for my face. However it does not completely deter me from using the product. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new product to try. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Bright and soft. So I received the trial size of Total Effects and was leary. Don't get me wrong, I love Oil of Olay, have used the face moisturiser daily for decades. But did I need and anti ageing one Yes it seems I did! I have been using it for 2 weeks and I have already noticed the fine lines have gotten smoother and less noticeable. My skin tone has evened out, less circles around my eyes. It has been great in keeping my face nice and soft. My face hasn't had any dry spots or roughness. I have been very happy with it. Only thing I noticed was the scent. I prefer not to have any scents on my face. However once it's on the smell does not last long. I will be very interested in the fragrance free version.

"Olay Total Effects I started using Olay Total Effects approximately 2 weeks ago as a product tester for Bzzagent! I have been a long time user of Clinque in the past, so I was interested in trying something new. At this time of year my skin seems to change with the changing weather, it seems to always feel tighter and gets dry easily. Not this year! Since I started using Olay Total Effects my skin feels good, and looks good too. I think that it's 'unique vitamin complex' has actually helped 'fight the signs of aging' and my skin tone is much more even. My overall experience with Olay Total Effects has been great, I cannot honestly remember the last time my face felt and looked so good during the winter months!

It's so simple As a new mom I find I barely have time to get ready in the morning The moisturizer was quick and easy. I just need one quick pump and rubbed it in as i moved on to my next task. I really liked that I did not have to use handfuls and handfuls of it or reapply it through out the day. It has a scent to it which I'm not usually fond of but it's refreshing and I found that it did not last long. I can't tell if it helped with wrinkles or fine lines but my salon is soft and smooth. It's helped with my dry skin. My mom even asked to try to! One thing I wonder that's not on the bottle is its spf. I like using a lotion with spd of 15 usually. I would continue to use it daily and purchase in the future This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Liquid Gold I love this product and have made it an integral part of my everyday beauty routine. It goes on very smooth has a light inviting scent and is non greasy. After just a few short weeks Ive already noticed a reduction in my laugh lines ands and I have a natural glow (BYE BYE BRONZER). I use it before I go to bed at night after a gental cleanser and first thing in the morning before my makeup application. The small bottle makes it easy to transport for overnight travel and stays at my BF's house, without cluttering the counter too much (BONUS points) The consistency is not gummy or thick and its application is very even and quite light. Great job OLAY I am hooked! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Product Feeling a difference with a one time use sample, WOW! Great Product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"You CAN see the difference! What do smooth application, non-greasy formula, smooths out minor lines and is hydrating have in common Three words: Olay Total Effects! I have to admit that I was somewhat skeptical of the claims made by Olay. Wrinkle and pore reduction are not easy as you get older... add in some sun spots and you really have an uphill battle! I have used Olay Total Effects for about three weeks now and I admit I see the total effect! Winter and cold weather have been thrust upon us. I am in a snowy and cold part of the Country which really effects my skin. In the winter my lines are amplified and my skin feels very dry. Since I have been using Olay Total Effects this winter has been different! No longer does my skin feel taught and dry. My face feels moisturized and well nourished. I find that Olay lasts throughout the day so I do not have to keep reapplying and reapplying. I also have found that a little goes a long way. This means that you don't have to put globs and globs of product all over! The only con I can say is that I did not really like about the product is its dispenser. The pump is nice that it measures out a small amount but I feel as though there is a lot of product left behind in the container. This is obviously wasteful and costly. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Better with Use I've been using the Olay 7 in 1 for about 3 weeks with only a few days missed when I forgot to pack it to go away over New Years. The cream itself is nice. Not greasy. No perfume smell. Soaks in nicely. To say I've noticed a difference would be an overstatement, at this point. I do have sun spots that don't show too much in winter. A summer trial may have been better for me. I'll make a plan to do so. It does replenish dryness, without a doubt. And winter is the perfect test for this! I do have fine lines, but no wrinkles...yet. Hopefully with continued use this too will improve. I'm not certain what retail price will be once it arrives on the shelves but can see myself purchasing the product if it's in the competitive market.

Totally Effective When I first received Olay Total Effects I was sceptical of how it could differ from any other moisturizer. After using it for two days I still was not sure if I would see any improvement on my face. Though after using Olay Total Effects for a full week I coukd see and feel the difference! My face was not only moisturized well it gad a nice glow and firmness that was very noticeable. I have always had blotchy and uneven skin tones and was very pleased to see that Olay Total Effects reaaly helped even iut my akin after using it over time. The key is to apply everyday. It takes a little bit to start seeing results but you will be very impressed if you stick with it! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great for on the go significant results yet to be seen I started using Olay TotalEffects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer for several days now, havent seen anything major on my skin, however will say a little drop goes a VERY long way, I have quite dry skin so need to use a significant amount to feel like my skin is moisturized, only having to use a little bit is a bonus to my skin and wallet. I like how it has a little bit of a tint as well. I quite like the very light scent of the cream. Might have been able to report with bigger results to my actual skin but considering the size of the sample wont last too long. I like that being a 7 in 1, takes care of the need to use multiple products. For busy women on the go like me, this product is definitely great for my morning routine.

"This product works It feels and smells great.I liked using it every day. The value is exceptional.I would recommend it and plan to keep using Olay products. This cream does what it advertises.This cream is the best. Very ,very VERY GOOD .IT HAS MANY beneficial QUALITIES.I REALLY LIKED IT."
"Anti-aging moisturizer believer I received the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer from BzzAgent for free to try out and review. After trying it for a few weeks I've been happy with the results. I love it's smooth, fast absorbing cream and the smell is light and agreeable too. My skin looks smoother and brighter, but not greasy-looking. I think my skin now has an even tone, and some of the fine lines have minimized, but I'm sad to say that the wrinkles under my eyes are still there. I don't have age spots so I can't report on whether or not it works on that particular sign of aging. The non-greasy moisturizer has not caused me to breakout, which I tend to do with most moisturizers. For the most part, I am now an Olay Total Effects believer!

"So Soft Silky I have been using this product for over a week now and I absolutely LOVE how soft and silky my skin feels! I have been very skeptical of face creams in the past. I find a lot of the greasy or they cause me to break out. Not only has the Olay Total Effects moisturizer made my face more soft, but it in non greasy and my complexion seems to actually be clearing up:) That is a huge relief! I have been using the Olay brand for quite some time as I have combination skin. Although their products seemed to take care of the dryness in some spots, it seemed to make other spots more oily. This one offers the perfect balance and I want to shout my love from the rooftops! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"First impression I got to try this free from bzzagent and I was pretty impressed! After my shower and getting dressed I pumped a few times in my palm and applied to my neck and face. The texture was so smooth and so simple to apply! Such an even application and the dryness was instantly relieved! I felt that even after I applied play total effects 7 and then applied my daily makeup there were no issues! It applied so easily as if I had nothing on my skin! No clumsiness, unevenness and tightness! I've tried other moisturizers in the past and none have made me feel like there's nothing on my skin and nothing made makeup application as easily as this! So far I'm very impressed! After all, first impressions are the most important in my opinion! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great moisturizer I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks now before bed. I have always enjoyed using Olay products since they are very gentle on my skin and this product is no different. I am thirty and starting to consider using anti-aging products preemptively to slow down aging, this is the first product I have used that is specifically designed for anti-aging and I have been pleased with the product. While I have not seen any noticeable difference in my fine lines, I was pleased with other aspects of the moisturizer. I began using it at the beginning of winter. My skin often gets quite dry, but Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer did a very good job of keeping my skin moisturized. It moisturized well, yet still felt lightweight on my skin and absorbed well. I only apply moisturizer with SPF as my day moisturizer. Since the trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I received did not contain SPF I chose to apply the moisturizer at night only. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer does come with SPF 15 as well, and I would like to purchase that to use during the day and see if using the Total Effects moisturizers both morning and night would make a difference on my fine lines.

"Great product! When I was selected to sample this product I was really excited but never thought I would like it as much as I did! For starters, the product comes in a nice pump format which makes it easy to apply. I found the formula to spread easily and cover a lot of surface area and best of all, diminished the amount of acne I had on a daily basis! I also found that this product seemed to brighten the tone of my skin which helped it to look younger. I really liked this product but did not give it the full 5 stars because I did not notice a decrease in the appearance of wrinkles which was one thing I was really looking forward to. This is a great product and I will be buying it in the future if the price is right! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
smell good smell good because it has a good smell and it should be put in more stores so people can buy it
"Fantastice Product to Use 10 years ago I began using Regenerist because I wanted a softer and younger looks to my skin. I also had a large brown spot on the side of my face from sun damage. I bought the cream and used it everyday. Withing six to ten months the large brown spot disappeared, and I was very happy. I am an avid user of the Olay products.

"Olay total effects Well I just received my total effects yesterday! I was expecting a very small trial sized bottle but was pleasantly surprised I received a 15ml size bottle! Now at least I know I will be able to use it for a few weeks to see weather or not my skin will get results from the product! When I tried it I noticed that is was a very light weight cream and not greasy at all, just as it states on the box ! It also has a nice light scent not like some other creams I've tried which were to potent! Can't really judge however yet on any results I may have because I just used it once. I'm looking forward to seeing if my fine lines and skin tone and my overall skins appearance improves! I will bzz back in a few weeks! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Anti-aging I tried the product the first night it came in, it does what it says on the seven benefits. I don't have many wrinkles but it did smooth out the lines under my eyes I always had a problem with dark circles under my eyes and it fixed most of the problem I still have some dark circles but there smoother looking then they were before. It added more moisture to my skin which is even better now that the cold weather has started my face doesn't look as dry and dull. There's a shine and healthier looking skin. I always check reviews on products before I buy them to see if its worth the money or the time to try it. Im glad this is product stands by what it says I haven't tried it yet for the four weeks only on the second week but I have notice a difference already.

"Soft skin! I'm very particular about what I put on my face. I used this cream at night before bed. I do have to say I really liked the results. Things you need to know... *Skin felt soft *Skin was not irritated *Product smelled great! *Non-greasy- felt great on skin after application *Brightened my skin- skin was dull and uneven *Winter has made my skin dry so it helped to hydrate overnight *Fine lines did minimize Over all I really liked this product. I normally don't buy Olay face products, but would consider purchasing this one. My past experience with face creams have left me with a bad impression due to bad reactions, and turned me off of most products. However am very happy I tried Olay Total Effects!

"Magic in a bottle! As someone who is lothe to give in to the idea that I am aging, this product is perfect! It moisturizes without leaving your skin greasy, my skin is bright, and so healthy looking. I get awful dry patches on my face from my diabetes and they are gone! I look like myself again! I don't have to worry about makeup, because my skin looks great all on its own now! This is hands down the best moisturizer I have ever tried, with the added benefits of fighting fine lines and so much more! The only down side is the scent. I find it quite strong, and a little off putting. Something lighter, crisper would be preferable to me. I will be buying the unscented version. Thank you BzzAgent for allowing me to try this amazing miracle cream for nothing but my honest review! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
I like this brand I like the brand but it is a little high if you use all the recommended products. I probably need to over the choices in the brand.
"Olay has grown up My first face cream was the classic pink jar with the black top. It now looks like Olay has grown up! The first thing I noticed was how moist my skin was the next morning! I guess my face was needing some intense hydration! I started out trying it at night, wasn't too sure if it was too rich for daytime. But after a couple of weeks I liked what I saw in the morning. My skin didn't look as dry and not as tired. With the moisture my wrinkles looked like they were smoothing out. My co workers were giving me good feedback on how my skin was looking. They noticed that I didn't look as tired. The weather is getting colder so I may try it as my day cream as well. So far so good. Pretty impressed. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A Very Effective Face Cream Due to having very sensitive skin, I was a bit hesitant at first to try my new sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in one moisturizer. The next day I decided to use this cream for at least 1 week straight to see its effects. Firstly I was pleasantly impressed that it did not in any way affect my skin sensitivity. It went on very smooth and the light scent was very calming and refreshing. It amazingly kept my skin moisturized all day long while at the same time it smoothed out my uneven skin tone, reduced the appearance of my age spots, and overall, just brightened my face with a bit of a glow. I am very pleased with Olay Total Effects 7 in on moisturizer and will be purchasing a larger bottle shortly. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Younger smoother skin I wanted to try this for awhile before making a review. I always love Olay products and this is no exception. The texture and smell of it is wonderful and I am really liking the results so far. Nothing yet like looking 10 years younger, but it says you need 4 weeks for that. I haven't noticed a huge difference in my skin yet but it is definitely softer and more moisturized than before. My husband even said my skin felt really soft the other day to me. And when the husbands notice, that's big! I have noticed my skin tone is a bit brighter as well which is one problem I have that bothers me. I think it would be a product that I would buy once it comes out in February. I'll keep on using it till my sample runs out and i'm sure i'll get even better results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Younger look Luckily, with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, skin can look up to 10 years younger in just four weeks. I was lucky to try it for free from BuzzAgent and I am loving the results. My skin is so soft and I like the scent also. I have been using it for 10 days now and even my kids notice a difference. Before trying this I was looking for a product that wont make my face all oily or take lots of time to apply and remove. So you can imagine how excited I was. No more wasting money looking for a good product to use. I let my mom and sister try it and they also like the results. I sure cant wait till it comes to the stores in February 2016 I will be one of the first to be buying it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good moisturizer I have been using Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer for about 3 weeks now and I definitely notice a positive difference in my skin. Just to give you an idea of my skin type - I'm 26 and my skin is just starting to become dryer, it has always been very oily, so I was hesitant about using a moisturizer (almost EVERY moisturizer makes me break out) and adding more moisture to my skin. I get breakouts in my t zone often and I regularly use spot treatments and acne products. I've been using this moisturizer every morning before putting on makeup and it has made my skin feel softer and more supple. I feel like it has more of a 'glow' that it used to and my skin appears more firm and moisturized. In regards to the other effects of this cream, I don't feel like I've noticed a difference in my pore size, fine lines, or skin tone. I still have about half the bottle left so I'll have to wait and see if this cream improves with continued use. All in all I'm happy with the effects of this cream and I'm THRILLED that it hasn't made me break out! I'm hoping to see effects on fine lines in the future but I'm pleased with the improved condition of my skin already :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Soft as a Babys Bottom Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has taken over my moisturizing routine. I was a little put off from the quality of the pump at first but after a few squirts the product comes out smoothly. The product is gentle enough that it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin which is very important to me when looking for skin products. The formula doesn't have a strong scent and goes on smoothly leaving my skin so soft. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and have not noticed the anti aging properties making much of a difference but I am SO impressed with how well it evens out my skin. I had some dark blemishes on my face and after just 2 weeks they appear less dark and noticeable. For the moisturizing and skin tone evening I rate this a 4/5!

"The product is so smoothing I always had dry skin and I would try different types of lotions and I didn't really liked any of them until I saw this one. It's so smooth, keeps your skin soft. Plus it smells good too"
"Olay Works!! I have tried the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about 4 weeks now, when I first put it on I enjoyed the silky non-greasy texture, however my cheeks went red, I think I might have sensitive skin. I did continue to use it( twice a day actually) and after a few applications the redness in my cheeks did not appear( maybe Olay can make one for sensitive skin). I find my skin tone to be more even, my face has a slight glow and even today my Mom said you look beautiful, I told her that I was using OlayTotal Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. She said keep it up which I intend to do, now I did not notice any difference in my fine lines and wrinkles but the results I did get I am 100 satisfied. Olay is now part of my morning and evening routines. I feel better and I look better. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I love Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I got to try this product in a generous sample size which lsted me for several weeks. I was very pleasantly surprised by the product, and will absolutely purchase it in the future. I am in my early-mid thirties, and this is just the type of product I have been looking for. Often I find anti-aging creams can be much to rich for my normal/combination skin, but this is light and absorbs quickly, while still providing just the right amount of moisture. Aside from being a lovely moisturizer, the most noticable results of this product on my skin were increased brightness and evenness of skin tone. It made my skin look and feel fabulous, and I know this because several friends commented that my skin looked glowy, and asked what I was doing differently. I was initially a little disappointed that there was no SPF in this product, but apparently there is one that has an SPF (15 I think), and I am also interested in trying that product for day and sticking with this one as a night. If you are in your mid-thirties with normal/combination skin and are looking for a moisturizer with anti-agin properties, you should definitely give the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer a try.

"Olay total effects daily moisturizer review I really like this daily moisturizer, I think I might purchase one for my mother when I need to restock. I like the smell and texture. It definately leaves my face feeling moisturized. Although it probably isn't a good choice for those with greasy or oils skin. Works well for those with a dry face, as it helped my dry patches clear up. It is a little pricey for face moisturizer, but I think it's worth the price. I had a line forming on my forehead at the front of my eyebrow, I noticed that a couple days before my sample arrived in the mail, so once I got it I put it to use right away, and a week later I noticed the line had faded or smoothed out. Its still there but the moisturizer helped smooth it out, I think if I used the face wash before the moisturizer it could have made a greater difference.

Smooth Moisturized Skin Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer absorbed into my skin instantly. The smell is light and the lotion feels non greasy on my skin. I am really happy with the results I've experienced so far. I have sensitive skin and this lotion did not cause any irritation-which is a huge plus for me. It keeps my skin so well moisturized that by the end of the day I do not have the tight dry skin I normally end my work day with. Fine lines are not visible through the moisture. I really am enjoying the benefits that were immediate and the long term ones I have noticed like a brighter complexion and a more even skin tone. I would recommend Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging for anyone looking for a consistently great moisturizer to add to their beauty and skin care regime.

"Olay Total Effects I remember trying the Olay product line when I was 18, before all the new and improved products had come out. I always needed to find some type of facial cleaners, and moisturizers that wouldn't burn my skin as I have sensitive skin. So when I was picked to receive this product to base my review on I was pleasantly surprise, because I thought that it would burn like the last time I tried the product many moons ago, but that didn't happy this time and so I was quite happy with it. I can honestly say that this will be a must have product for me because it did leave my skin feeling soft and silky. Mind you I wasn't able to see if any of my crows feet diminished but would love to use the product again to help with the hydration of my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Got to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer and I was pleasantly surprised. I found the fragrance or lack thereof nice. I hate getting a cream that feels good but the smell just bothers me so. This both felt good and smelled fine. My skin felt smooth after putting it on. I liked that it didn't feel greasy but I thought it could be a little bit more moisturizing as my skin is more dry/normal type. Directions said to use daily so I only used it at night. My skin tone isn't really uneven so it was hard to tell if there was any change. Although I think my skin seems to be quite smooth when I wake up in the morning. I do have sun damage but I didn't notice much fading there. All in all I felt this to be a pretty good product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Amazing benefits in one bottle. Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a lightweight moisturizer that holds a good amount of niacinamide and silicones for a silky finish. This moisturizer also contains some good antioxidants. The moisturizer claim to intensely moisturize skin, reduce wrinkles, enhance skin tone and color, minimize pores, provide free-radical defense, and lift skin. Wow, all this in one bottle. it can improve the appearance and health of skin at any age. Use daily under makeup. I love it so much, it feels great to my skin. It gives glow to my skin. I am not disappointed with this product. I would prefer that I could purchase in a larger size.This is a good option for normal to oily skin. Thank you Olay and Bzz Agent for letting me try Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effects 7 is very effective I have had the opportunity to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer thanks to Olay and must admit I was skeptical at first as I don't often use moisturizers because it makes my face feel oily and heavy. I was wrong and really like this product. I have modified how I use it however, because I have noticed in the areas where my face tends to be oilier it has caused break outs (my nose and chin). For the areas where my face is drier (forehead and cheeks), this has given some great moisture to these areas and helped prevent such a dry chapped look. On my cheeks my pores are not as noticeable with the added moisture. It does not feel oily, it goes on light, smooth and absorbs quickly into the skin. I will certainly look to continue using Olay on a regular basis. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Okay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer I just completed my trial of the new olay 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer. The first evening I tried it, I felt as though it was pretty similar to all the other olay moisturizers I had used in the past. It's a pretty heavy, thick cream compared to my usual Clinique. BUT on day 5 I really had grown to like its thicker texture and heavy moisturizing agents. As a winter moisturizer, I would definitely buy this again (I live in a very dry climate where the heat is blasting from October to February) While I didn't notice a drastic difference in my two week trial, it did keep my skin well hydrated and not overly greasy. I do feel as a spring/summer moisturizer this would be a bit too heavy for me (combination skin) but over all, I'd definitely purchase it for the dry winter months. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great The best stuff I have ever used please everyone try this out you will love it this smells great
"Good packaged moisturizer I've always liked Olay's Total Effects line. It's a hassle to put on different creme and lotion for different things. This 7 in 1 moisturizer saved me a lot of time and made me feel like I am getting everything done in one bottle. The bottle is packaged in a pump so it is easy to dispense. Also, it is hygienic because you don't need to constantly dip your finger in a jar to take out the product. The texture is light and smooth. My skin feels well moisturized and the creme absorbs into the skin nicely and does not leave a residue. I don't really have enough time to tell whether it made a difference yet in reducing my age/sun spots or wrinkles. However, overall it is a well priced moisturizer and a brand that I trust.

"Helped with fine lines and skin tone I've been trying this moisturizer for about 10 days now, and I'm glad I waited a while to be able give this product the review that it deserves. When I first tried this product on my skin, I noticed that it's creamier than the moisturizers I typically use and it has a slight fragrance which I don't mind. I have sensitive combination skin and was worried that this would make my skin feel greasier than it already was. I was pleasantly surprised with the texture on my skin. My skin feels smooth and moisturized and protected with this product. Over several days of use, I started to notice how my skin tone was more even - even my husband noticed the difference! I'll need to purchase the full size bottle of this moisturizer, to really reap the anti-aging benefits longer-term! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I have very sensitive and allergic skin, so I was a little hesitant to use a facial moisturizer for fear that I would have a reaction to it. I work in a very dry and dirty environment, which further aggravates my sensitive skin, but I'm not getting any younger so I thought I'd give it a try. I've only been using it once a day, but I've been pleasantly surprised! The moisturizer is so light and airy, I don't even notice it. No heavy, greasy feeling at all! The small dry patches disappeared after the first day, and my complexion looks healthier overall. I haven't had any allergic reaction to it, so I'm thrilled to say I've found a product that is both effective and safe for me to use. I will definitely purchase Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer from now on! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects cream I received a free sample of Olay Total Effects facial cream last week and been using it every morning since it arrived. So what I really like about this cream: THe container is so convenient for many reasons. One push and you get the right amount of cream to apply to your face + it avoids contamination since you don't dip your fingers in a jar. THat is a big bonus. THe texture is really light smooth. It would not be good as a night cream, but wonderful as a day cream (not sure about cold months though as its very thin and dries out really quick. But I love it). The scent is so mild and fresh. I feel my skin being smooth and already notice reduced fine lines which is great! What I don't like as much about this cream: well after using it for a week now my face is breaking out... So I am not sure this specific cream is the right match for me, but it could be for you. Seems to clog my pores. Same happened before when I used other Olay products for my face. Don't let this keep you from buying it as we all have different type of skin. I rated it a 4 stars because I really like everything about it that I described above, just not the right combination for my skin. Still recommend it. You should try it out!

"Great product! I'm a big fan of keeping my skin moisturized and apply it daily. I am outside a lot and in this cold weather I need something that will work overtime on creating nice, smooth, even skin. The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer did just that. My cheeks can get rosey and because of the cold, I get small patches of dryness. After two days of using this product, I could already tell a difference. I apply it after I shower and it absorbs right away. It's very light. At first I wasn't a fan of the smell but it's definitely grown on me now and the results are worth it. I'm able to apply this moisturizer and then my makeup with no problems at all. I will definitely be buying his product again! And I can't wait to buy a trial size as well, perfect for vacations!

"Would definitely use again I can't honestly say I notice a visible difference in my skin, but I have received some compliments on my complexion, and how youthful it looks, from those who see me regularly in my neighbourhood, but don't know me well. I think, for me, it's more realistic to say that the product can help me maintain a youthful look rather than reverse signs of aging. I say this because, I think I have a bit of an advantage in the gene department, and already look quite young for my age. It feels good on the skin, and a little goes a long way, which is nice. I would buy this product myself, but I would opt for the unscented version. The scent is not bad, and did not irritate my skin, but there are days when I find anything scented annoying, which is why I would opt for no scent.

"Olay Total Effects 7 Moisturizer I have been using this moisturizer twice a day for about a month now. I have a fairly large sun spot, about 1/3 inch in diameter on my upper left cheek. After a couple of weeks I did not notice any effect on this spot but after a month I noticed it was quite a bit lighter in color and not as prominent. It takes less concealer and it is faster to cover it up. This product is a good overall facial moisturizer, it absorbs quickly and leaves no residue. It leaves my complexion looking bright and radiant. I did not notice any smoothing of larger wrinkles, but I did notice an improvement in smaller wrinkles and fine lines. These look less severe and less prominent. I rate this product 4 out of 5 stars and will be looking for it on the shelves of my local drug store. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not what I expected I was hesitant when I first recieved my trial of Olay 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer. I've never really tried a anti aging product before and the ones I have tended to be heavy and greasy. This was not the case with Olay 7 in 1. I was pleasantly surprised by how silky and light the moisturizer was, it went on smooth and covered alot of skin in one pump. Although I didn't notice a difference in clarity or wrinkles, I did notice that my skin apeared brighter and younger. It had a warm glow and was very soft to the touch. I'm not sure if I will pay full price for this product yet, as I'm in my 30s and not quite too concerned with my youthful appearance, but I would definitely grab it when it's on sale as a pretty darn good night/morning moisturizer. God job Olay! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The regenerating cream does miracles for me. I am 62 years of age. The regenerating cream gives me the look of a new teenage soft shiny face. I have dry skin and the cream makes my skin softer and makes me feel like I am a teenager again. I am single, so I can hold my head up high when I go dancing. Everyone woman needs this product, if they want to look young again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My review of olay total effect I enjoy trying new skin products, as I'm getting older I'm noticing my skin is not as youthful as it once was. As I age I realize I need to protect my skin more now then ever and am glad to be given the chance to try the new olay total effect face cream. The travel size bottle in which I recieved was the perfect size, and distrubited the perfect amount of cream for each use. I've gotten the chance to use this product for about five days now once when I wake up and once before bed or after showers and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised by it. The formula left my skin feeling silky smooth with every use, never too oily it soaked into my skin leaving it visibly brighter and rejuvenated. I even used it as a moisturizer under my makeup and it worked wonders. I look forward to purchasing this product in full size for my every day beauty routine in the future.

"Olay total effects moisturizer I love trying new moisturisers, they give me a great opportunity to compare my usual moisturisers against a new one to see if my regular routine should be changed up. While I can contest to the smoothing and skin evening properties of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I'm also able to say I saw some improvement in my skin tone ( it helped reduce my skin discolouration due to acne scarring) and I defiantly saw a reduction in pore size. So from that prospective I would deficiently recommend the . Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I sadly struggle to see any improvement on the anti aging front so I can not speak to that. However given how good it is at the other claims it makes I see no reason why it wouldn't help. So overall a big thumbs up. Olay as usual doesn't disappoint. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great moisturizer! I have been using this for a few weeks now and feel like it's definitely helped with my issues with dryness. I've been using it after washing my face and before going to bed, on my face and neck. The scent is nice and light and the formula is light as well. In the morning find that it doesn't leave a greasy feeling on my skin unlike some other products I have used before. I think it has helped with the brightness and evening my skin-tone a bit too which is an added bonus (and also happens to be listed as one of its benefits) as I primarily use these products to help with dryness. What I didn't notice was any difference in firmness, minimizing my pores, smoothing fine lines or wrinkles or with reducing age spots. That said, perhaps the longer I use it the more benefits I will notice some of these things. On the other hand I don't really have any age spots yet so that's a moot benefit for me and I only use it in the evening. I would use this in my morning ritual if it offered sun protection. I will continue to use this product and probably buy a full-size once this trial finishes. I definitely recommend giving it a try! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not quite 10 years, but i do look younger! I do like the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I have been using it for about 4 weeks and although I don't think that I look 10 years younger, I didn't expect to. It has really helped a problem that I have had for about four years an age spot on my left cheek. I really hate that thing and this has definitely helped reduce its appearance. I really like that you can get the product with sunscreen broad spectrum SPF 15, since I believe that the sun is the source of some spots on my pale skin. I don't feel that it has reduced the appearance of the fine lines on my forehead, but I expect that it would with continued use. Overall my skin tone looks more even, and my dry spots have been diminished. This allows me to wear less makeup, which I really like because it saves me time. Thanks Olay, I think this is a great product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great moisturizer I have been using Olay moisturizers for years. I was given a sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer through BzzAgent to review. As far as a moisturizer goes, it is fantastic. I live in a very cold and dry climate and it successfully tackled my dry skin! I am nearly 40 and do have a few sun spots and definitely a few wrinkles. I didn't notice a difference in my sun spots but with consistent use my wrinkles seemed less defined. I would definitely recommend this product as a great every day moisturizer. My only issue with my sample was that it didn't have an SPF, which is one the most important components to help fight aging. After a little more research, when Olay Total Effects is available in February, you will be able to get an SPF 15 version. That's the one I will buy! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"EFFECTIVE CHANGE I was pleasantly surprised after using Olay Total Effects for a week. I have used Olay products in the past and they have irritated my sensitive skin. This product has been very gentle and I have had no irritation. I have been using it as a night cream. as I need to wear a product with SPF during the day time. The product sample I was generously provided with, was not the SPF version. This was a generous product sample as you certainly do not need a lot of product for coverage. After a week, I am surprised as to how much is left. While I have not noticed much change in my fine lines or skin tone, I am delighted to see a fading of my age spots. I have also been using the product on my hands, and the fading is most noticeable on them. I would expect that the benefits of this product, reduced fine lines, smaller pores and evening of skin tone would be gradual and more noticeable after one week of use. As of now, I am very impressed with this product, and plan to continue to use it. I also plan to purchase it in the future if I find it on sale or have a coupon. I will be loaning it to a friend to try for a few days as she had seen this product in a magazine and really wanted to try it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay total effects 7 in 1 I was so excited to receive the trial size Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer from bzzagent. After trying the product for 2 weeks it has its pros and cons which is why I rated it 4 out of 5. The trial size product didn't last the whole 4 weeks like promised so a little disappointed as well as not 100 full results. The product also has a strong smell when first applying but does slowly fade. I was blown away by the results I did see! After the first usage my face instantly felt silky smooth and much softer!! The product blends very well and quickly that being said it's great under makeup!! After a week I noticed it evened out my skin tone as well as minimized my pores and cleared up my acne prone skin!! Who wouldn't want a moisturizer that does that!!! It doesn't roll or crumble like some moisturizers do! The packaging was cute and functional and I like the pump dosage it covered my whole face-a little goes a long way here!! I'm excited to find a product that will fit into my budget that I don't have to give up on quality! It's also easily attainable. I strongly recommend the 50ml bottle and not the 15ml trial as it did not last as promised. However big thumbs up Olay!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"A great all around moisturizer I really like this moisturtizer! I broke out a little at first, as I have dry, sensitive skin, but it cleared up quickly and I was on to radient skin. After a few weeks, my skin is more supple and brighter, a sun spot on my nose has lessened noticeably and my fine lines are virtually non existent! I do have one line above my lip that has been the bane of my existence, but it too has lessened and I'm really looking forward to seeing if I get more results as I continue to use the product. I would have given Total Effects 5 stars, but it does leave me a little shiny, which doesn't work so well with my makeup. That just means more thoughtful timing though and it's nothing a little blotting doesn't take care of. It definitely won't deter me from purchasing it again in the future. Love it!

Maxing packaging with awesome result Feels like 30 in my 45. Most recommended product for all the ladies out there
"Difference Noted I was please to find that it is a light product that does not leave your skin feeling greasy and is very easy to apply as the bottle has a pump on the top and dispenses I would say, just the right amount. It is quickly absorbed into the skin, has a light pleasant smell and does not put colour on your face. I have noticed that the redness that is on my skin has definitely reduced since using this moisturizer and that some of the fine lines I have, have been smoothed out. I don't seem to notice a difference in the size of the pores but my skin does feel a little firmer and less dull looking. Would I buy this product again, yes. I would recommend that everyone who tries it gives it at least 3-4 weeks so you can see the effects This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Amazing Best product I have ever used and never felt so satisfied and it is amazing amazing amazing product!!!!!!! I recommend everyone to try this product
"3012685147 I love oley products, they smell good,clean and fresh."
"OLAY, You Made My Skin Soft What do you need to know about Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is that it takes your combination skin and reforms it to your soft and silky adolescent years! No more fine lines and wrinkles after two weeks of continuous use. Those pores that always pop out at you in the mirror are now so small that you barely notice they are there. Using this moisture has changed my way of thinking that there was no hope for my face. The only downfall is the price point which is a little to expensive and the fragrance is not my cup of tea, however it does not last more than a few minutes. Should you buy this product Heck Ya you should! Who wouldn't want to make those 7 signs of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone disappear You would be crazy not to -) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects I am really excited to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. For myself, I would like to see an improvement in fine lines, age spots AND uneven skin tone, so this really seems like a product for me. I have been using the product for about a week now. My first impressions are that it has a pleasant smell (I hate overly perfumed products and the chemical smell of fragrance-free products), it has a smooth and light texture, and that it leaves my face looking shiny but not feeling oily (not sure how I feel about this last part yet). I have noticed some breakouts since yesterday but am reserving judgement as to whether it is caused by the cream or not. I will definitely continue to use the product for the next few weeks to see if any improvements in fine lines and skin tone are noticeable. Will keep you posted!

"10 years younger So I wanted to use the Olay 7 signs of aging product for a good amount of time before writing a review. I really like the Olay brand. I have sensitive skin and they're the one company that I've never had an issue with. Let's start with the good: It's Olay! Already a benefit right there. A well known, trusted company with decent products for my skin type. Also, the product moisturized my skin without making my skin look or feel greasy or slick. Now as for the 10 years younger claim Not so sure about that one. But then again I don't have age spots and don't think I have any noticeable fine lines so maybe I wasn't the targeted skin type However, that being said I WOULD keep using it because it made my skin soft and has a great smell and maybe when I really start to age it won't be noticeable since I've been using Olay ) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Pleasantly surprised! I have to say that I am actually really surprised how much I like this cream! It has a really nice light scent and goes only really light and does not feel greasy. I have used other Olay products (not anti-aging creams) and was not impressed, I found them really heavy and they usually make me breakout. This stuff is really nice. I have a whole host of skin issues like rosacea and mask of pregnancy on my forehead that never went away. This cream appears to calm the redness of the rosacea and appears to have lessened the appearance of the mask of pregnancy. As for wrinkles I never really paid attention to that before and never realized how many I actually have, so thanks for that! I have not noticed a huge change with the wrinkles but I have not used the cream for a full 4 weeks yet. So here's to hoping for less wrinkles!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A good moisturizer Olay Total Effects claims the following: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles Evens skin tone appearance Enhances brightness Minimizes the look of pores Visibly reduces age spots Restores firmness Replenishes moisture If I was asked to describe in one word what this cream is doing for my skin, I would say providing moisturization. I have been using it for the four weeks, in the morning. I have slighyly dry skin and the cream absorbs on my face quickly. There is neither any whitish cast nor any greasy feeling. It has a medium consistency, neither runny nor too thick, something between a lotion and a cream. It has a very soft feel to it, as in the texture is very smooth. It has a strong floral fragrance, which remains for quite some time. I did not notice any difference in the firmness of my skin nor any visible difference in my pore size. I don't think I have any noticeable lines or wrinkles, so I cannot comment on that. I will say that my skin seemed bright and even but this also has never been a problem for me. I also don't have any age spots so I cannot comment on that either. Overall I liked this product as a moisturizer. My skin feels more supple and nourished and looks even and bright.

"I like it better the longer I use it I received a sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and have been using it for the last month or so. I think this is a good product and I will purchase it in the future. It says it helps to fight things like age spots, uneven skin tone and fine lines. I think my skin looks fresher and feels great after using it but can't say if it is preventing things from getting worse or not. I have rosacea and think it may have helped my skin to be a little less red. I have the beginning of age spots but didn't notice any significant improvement with them. It feels nice going on and blends in quickly. It doesn't feel or look oily. It doesn't add any sort of colour to my skin and doesn't look like I'm wearing make-up or cover-up. It comes in a pump container that dispenses a pre-set amount. It takes me 3 pumps to cover my face and I was pleasantly surprised by how long the small sample I received has lasted. When I purchase this product I will look for the non-scented version but have to say that after using it for a few weeks I don't notice the scent in the scented version. The longer I use it, the more I like it and I would recommend it to others. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Hydrated and healthy looking skin! The Olay total effects 7 in one anti-aging moisturizer is very good to gives my skin the perfect amount of moisture. It leaves my skin looking and feeling hydrated and healthy. This moisturizer is not to greasy and will not leave your skin feeling sticky. I have been using this moisturizer daily for several weeks now and I find that it does not clear away any of my darks spots and it did not smooth out my fine lines. This moisturizer did improve my skin tone and helped my skin tone look more even and brighter. I like how this moisturizer has a beautiful light scent to it. I also like the pump of the bottle because one pump lets out a perfect amount of moisturizer to use all over my face. Overall, this moisturizer does not do very much for the signs of my aging skin like fine line and dark spots but it does an awesome job at hydrating and gives my skin a nice dewy glow. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Results after only 2 weeks! I have been looking forward to trying this Oil of Olay 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer to see if it really works. I am 36 years old and don't have a lot of wrinkles and lines, however, I have seen results already after only using the product for two weeks. When I opened the little sample bottle and pumped some product on my fingertips I was worried that it would be too oily for my skin and cause breakouts - this was not the case at all. It is a little heavier than my regular daytime oil-free lotion and a little lighter than my night time cream. The product has a light sense which I really enjoy and applies with little to no effort. My skin has been glowing , my dry patches have disappeared and overall my skin looks healthier and feels really soft. Also, I have had no breakouts from using the product which is such a relief! ( I have sensitive skin and usually can't handle any scented moisturizers or ones that are not oil-free). I really enjoy using this product so far and can't wait to see what the results will be after another two weeks. Thanks for the sample Oil of Olay! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I Can Deny My Age Thanks to Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I'm not aging...I'm young and always will be! Well, now I can live in my denial thanks to Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer! This amazing Olay product has a unique vitamin complex that helps with 7 signs of aging. Of course, I don't have any of those...well, maybe I do have some of those fine lines and wrinkles, and some larger pores, and my skin doesn't have as much moisture as it used to. Thanks to Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, these problems have been made a whole lot better! This moisturizer goes on really nice. It feels smooth and it's not oily at all. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling amazing! After using for an entire week, my skin definitely feels smoother, and has a nice glow about it! As for the wrinkles...I'm not sure that it's done a lot for that, but I do plan on using the product on a regular basis now, so hopefully after little more time, I'll notice a change. Overall, I highly recommend Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for everyday use. It'll make you feel younger and your skin will thank you.

"will buy this when my skin looks older I recently received Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer. From Bzzagent to test for free. I found this product was super smooth. I was nervous to put on my face as I have pretty sensitive skin and have been allergic to different products on the past. I tried this on my hand first and felt great so I tried on my face. Here are 7 things this product claims to do... Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles* I don't have a problem with this yet, so I personally didn't notice anything different. Evens skin tone appearance *It did smooth my skin, not sure I would say it evened my skin tone. Enhances brightness *my skin did look really good after. Minimizes the look of pores* I personally have pretty small pores to begin with, so I didn't notice this much. Visibly reduces age spots* I'm not at the point where I have age spots. At almost 30 people still ask if I'm 20 yet. Restores firmness* I did notice my skin was more firm. Almost as if I did a face mask. Replenishes moisture* this has help with the dry skin during the winter. Over all this is a nice product, I loved how it felt on my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I got a free trail size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I was super excited to get this as I use Olay body wash, bar soap and original face cream. However, once I received the product I wasn't quite sure how I felt about it, that's why I took so long to buzz. There were things I liked about it right away, it had a great light scent, it was thick not watery but it didn't feel heavy or greasy on face once applied but wasn't sure if there was anything special about it. Now that it has been 3-4 weeks, my face feels great, no dry patches, any redness has diminished, my face is starting to feel firmer and look brighter. I didn't have any real fine lines or wrinkles so can't speak to what effect it has on those. Overall, after giving Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer a fair trial I think it is a great product and will continue to you once my free trail has ran out.

"First Thoughts... Now it usually takes a bit of time before I can really tell the difference with creams, but I figured I would review the first thoughts on the progress. So this is my first Anti-Aging Moisturizer, as I don't think I've needed it before and I was little skeptical to use this product. I have very sensitive and oily skin, so I am always careful when using a new product. I didn't try this on my face yet, only because I wanted to see how it would react to my skin. So with first use on my hands my first thoughts were, wow the cream is SUPER light. I was actually surprised at how light it would be, and I thought it would have a more thicker and heavier texture to it. This is good, because I again because my skin is more on the oily side I like to use cream that is light. The smell isn't overpowering again, which is really nice to know because I don't like creams that stink too much. The most I will be looking forward to is the skin tone completion with this cream. SO far it's a 4/5 for me, just based on texture of and lightness of the cream. More reviews to come, after I've used this product for a few more days!

"7 in 1 fighting wrinkle moisturizer I started using the Olay 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer cream three weeks ago :) I am in love with this new product and have purchased the product since receiving my sample from BzzAgent! The moisturizer goes on smooth with no greasy feel and absorbs quickly into the skin. I feel over the past few weeks that the area around my eyes has appeared more refreshed and the crows feet are less noticeable - it is definitely as a result of Olay's 7 in 1 cream. I did not rate this moisturizer a 5 out 5 for the simple fact of the strong scent. Although I do enjoy the perfumey refreshing scent of this product, I find it to be a tad strong and to linger on the skin long after application. It would be the perfect product, I believe, if it was unscented! I would definitely recommend Olay 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer to family and friends and will continue to use this product in the future! Thanks BzzAgent!!

"Nice Moisturizer I have been using the Olay 7 in 1 moisturizer for over a month now. My experience with this product is mostly positive. I like to put on the moisturizer in the morning, before I do my makeup. The product doesnt have a strong scent, and I like that a lot. It feels very nice on my skin, not heavy or oily. It dries quickly, so when I apply my makeup, I have no problem at all, and the two act very nicely together. As the day goes on, my skin continues to feel nicely moisturized and does not dry up. It works very well, even in the winter when it is very cold outside. I definitely like this product a lot and it makes my face feel great, but Im not sure how well the anti-aging action works. My minor wrinkles still appear to be the same as always, not very prominent, but still there. Despite this one detail, I would definitely buy this product again. It is a high-quality moisturizer and more. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great moisturizer For the longest time, Oil of Olay has been a beauty staple in my daily regime. In the mornings I use the Complete All Day Moisture Lotion with sunscreen and in the evenings I use the Classic Moisturizing Lotion. It never occurred to me to change up my regime primarily since I'm a believer of the saying if it ain't broke, don't fix it. However (and sadly) I'm not getting any younger, so it was time to review and update my beauty regimen. I was excited to get the opportunity to review Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer. It claims to hydrate and diminish the appearance of fine lines, large pores and dark spots. The key ingredients include niacinamide to improve tone and texture glycerin to moisturize and vitamins B3, B5 and E as antioxidants. Upon first use the lotion has a light scent and quickly sinks in making my skin feel super moisturized right away. I've been using it for almost one week now and while I don't have fine lines and wrinkles, I did notice a nice glow. I will continue to use and hope to see additional benefits. All it's missing is sunscreen. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Quite Impressed With Olay I was very excited to try this product as it is supposed to fight the seven signs of aging which include Visibly smoothing fine lines and wrinkles, Evens skin tone appearance, Enhances brightness, Minimizes the look of pores, Visibly reduces age spots, Restores firmness, and Replenishes moisture. I have been using it for a few weeks now and what I do like about it is that it goes on smoothly and it didn't leave a greasy feel on my skin after using it. It is fragrance free which I really like since I have more sensitive skin. I do notice that my skin looks brighter and my skin tone is more even than it was before. My skin definitely feels more hydrated and supple. I really liked that it is Non-Comedogenic (Wont Clog Pores. All in all I wish I had a bigger bottle so I could test it for longer and see if it makes even more of a difference. I would recommend the product to friends and family. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My skin's so soft I'm now on the 7th day of using the Olay cream and took pictures on day 1, day 3 and day 7 to see if I could see a difference because it's normally so hard to tell when you look at yourself in the mirror everyday. I have been putting it on morning and night after I wash my face and the very first thing I've noticed is that my face is a lot softer then it has ever been. The lines around my eyes, even though are still there, have definitely become softer. That, for me, is a wonderful thing :) I haven't seen a big difference in the size of my pores but as I continue to use this product, I will continue to take pictures periodically. The cream rubs in very well and doesn't leave any greasy or oily finish on the skin. It's great for putting on right before you apply makeup as well. Overall I really like this product and will more then likely be buying it when it comes out in stores in February. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smells good, feels great! I got my trial size sample of Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 in the mail yesterday complimentary of BzzAgent and have already starting using it. It has the same great fragrance and the rest of the Olay product line, which I appreciate very much. No other brands have, for me, come close to Olay in terms of smell. It's subtle, yet pleasant enough to make a statement. The moisturizer feel light and refreshing on the face and also distributes very evenly with no residue. I have breakout prone combination skin so I am always very careful when choosing skincare products. I was turned away from many other creams because of how heavy and oily they feel but luckily this has never been a problem with Olay. With that being said, I'm not too crazy about the pump dispenser. It makes the amount more difficult to control. The size of the bottle is also not something I would consider in stores because I don't think 15mL will be enough to create a visible difference. I always finish a full size product of anything new I try in order to avoid premature evaluations. But, I guess we shall see with this one! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A Miracle in a Bottle I wish I would have taken a 'before' picture! I've never been a big fan f wrinkle cream. No time, oily, messy, make-up slides around halfway through the day. And then.... I tried this! After the first few days, I didn't use it only under foundation. I used it instead of!! Two weeks in, a friend told me I'm looking way better, and more rested. lol. I'm no more rested, I'm using this Miracle in a bottle! 4 weeks in, I'm still loving this, and bought a bottle of the other Olay 7 Effects, hoping it will last me until this new one is released. I sure do notice the mornings I don't remember to use it. My face feels tighter and dry, and my wrinkles look like wrinkles, not smile lines. Also, for those of you who worry about sensitivity, I am pretty sensitive to new products, and didn't have any problems. I did notice some of my sun spots have disappeared. There's a big one on my temple that's still there, but nothing has removed that one. The rest, looking like a mask of pregnancy or freckles, are all GONE!! The only reason I give this product a 4 out of 5 stars is that I was hoping for more results around the eyes, and haven't noticed much difference yet.

"Regeneration needed and delivered! Having turned 50, my skin is definitely changing. I turned to Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream for some skin therapy, and I am so pleased with the results. My skin feels smoother, my face looks more hydrated and youthful. I recommend this product for anyone trying to reverse the effects of time and sun. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects Review After using Olay Total Effects for a couple of weeks, I have noticed an evening of skin tone and an increase in moisture. Usually during the winter months, my skin gets very dry, yet, it is staying moisturized at this time. I have very sensitive skin and Rosacea and usually break out or have a burning feeling using most face care products. So far, there have not been any side effects from using this product. It goes on smooth, easy, light, and blends in evenly. It does not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy. I am almost 39 years old and have some lines developing on my forehead and around my eyes. I did not notice any changes/improvements in these lines, however, I was pleased with the product in all other claimed areas. I would recommend this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"seems pretty good i wanted to give this product a good try before reviewing it... At first I thought it was absolutely amazing, used it day and night. However after using it for a while I found it became a bit oily therefore only used it for nighttime after removing makeup. Overall, I found a small amount went very far therefore you're not stuck using a hefty amount of cream like you have to with some other moisturizers. It also seemed very silky and smooth. It didn't have an over-powering scent nor did it have smell that you can relate to other anti-aging products (older scent). Instead this seems to have a light young scent. Lastly, it has a light feel to it and just seems to glide on. It is never too soon to start using anti-aging products and I feel like this one delivered in all aspects. I will be purchasing this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer I use Olay's Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer right after I step out of the shower. My skin always ends up looking dry and flacky after a shower so using a moisturizer right after really helps. The first thing I noticed about this cream is that it is fragrance free. It does not seem to have any harsh ingredients in it also as it did not burn my skin. The cream applies evenly and quickly and a little goes a long way. Once the cream dries, I can immediately feel a difference in my skin, more firm somehow. Not sure about my skin looking younger though. I would have to keep using this cream on a daily basis for a month to really see if it lives up to its claims of making skin appear 10 years younger ...for now, Olay's Total Effects moisturizer is a great way for me to re-hydrate my skin after a shower.

"Magnificently Made Moisturizer! Thank you BzzzAgent for sending this to me! This is a great product for those of us who have combination to dry skin ad for those who have sensitive skin. I have sensitive skin and I will tell you this product did not bother me. There was no redness, or itchiness. No flaking and NO breakouts. I used it for three weeks and my skin feels smooth and soft. It evened out my skin tone, but did not lessen the pigmentation I have, unfortunately. If you are looking for it to reduce lines an wrinkles, I did not find it did this. However, it is such a good moisturizer! I live in a climate that can get down to -45 C and my skin can get very dry. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer helped combat the dryness and made my skin feel good. There is no overpowering smell and it it blends well into my face. It soaked in and my skin felt moisturized. I'm impressed! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A very promising moisturizer At 35, I'm more interested in preventing wrinkles than fighting the lines I'd already have. I also have sensitive skin, so I find that a lot of anti-aging moisturisers are too heavy and cause me to break out. I like the lightness of this moisturiser, and it goes on smooth and dries quickly. It doesn't have a noticeable scent. What pleases me the most is it's promise to replenish moisture. My skin feels nice and supple without being oily. After using it a month, I can definitely say my skin tone looks more even and brighter, and minimized the look of my pores! I can't speak for reducing age spots, and I don't know that my skin appears any firmer, but I do think my fine lines are less noticeable. The only thing keeping me from giving this a 5-star review is the fact that I tend to break out a little. However, I intend to continue to use it as a day moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Thinner lines, soft skin I was unsure going into this trial. I have been using daily lotion from Olay for decades. However I have never tried any anti ageing lotion. When I first pumped out the lotion I was surprised by the smell. I always use sensitive skin lotion, with no scents. However after I put it on the first time the smell quickly dissipated as it dried. I don't even notice the smell any more. I will likely buy the scent free version however. I am finding my skin softer and less dry come the end of the day then it was with my other lotion. Before I had to reapply more than once a day, now it's good all day. As for the fine lines, after 2 weeks of using it daily I am finding they are less noticeable then before. My skin tone has evened out and doesn't look dry. I will most likely buy more of this lotion when the trial bottle runs out. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Pretty good Moisturizer After using my sample olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti aging Moisturizer I can definitely say I like how it feels on my skin and that it definitely makes it feel nice throughout the day it's not too heavy or scented which is nice because my skin is sensitive to many things. I've not had any problems in the past with olay Moisturizer and this sample was no different. I do trust the olay brand more than others because of my previous experiences with their products being positive. I can't say whether I found that this Moisturizer combated wrinkles or does all the things that it claims like evening skin tone because it does say this happens over 4 weeks and I didn't get to use it that long with the size of my sample. That being said I would definitely buy it in the store when I see it on shelves. I told all my female co-worker about this lotion at our Christmas luncheon and it led to a nice long conversation about skin amd how it changes as you age. Considering my office is filled with women of varying ages, there were many women interested in trying this lotion olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer.

"Like Magic I got the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer to try from BzzAgent. I had previously not tried any moisturizers. I am nearing thirty, however, and those fine lines are starting to look less fine. I liked that it had a push dispenser. When confronted with things like this I never know how much or how little to apply. There was no worries with this. It dolled out the perfect amount onto a fingertip. You do not need much of the cream to cover the entire face. I was very shocked the first time I used it. Just in the first few minutes I could feel a tightening of my skin. I've only been using the cream for two weeks, and not the four for maximum results, but I am still quite pleased with the results. My skin feels smoother and less red, my pores are definitely smaller and my crows feet are less noticeable. I will be purchasing this again, in the regular size. I love how easy it is, and how nice it makes me feel to use it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good moisturizer! I received a sample bottle of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer to try free from Olay and BzzAgent. The moisturizer is very thick and luxurious, with a mild, very pleasant scent. A little goes a long way and it was very easily absorbed into my skin. I started off using it both in the morning and evening, but didn't find it quite moisturizing enough for my extremely dry winter skin. I found I needed a little more moisture in the morning before applying my makeup. It was great for evening use, and would be great for me to use in the a.m and p.m during summer months. I have very uneven skin tone and found it didn't do too much to improve that. However, I did notice a considerable difference in the size of my pores, and my skin looked smoother with less fine lines. All in all, I think this is a pretty good product. I would recommend trying it, especially if your skin isn't quite as dry as mine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I am a black man And I would like to stay that way. This product is clearly made for a totally different demo than myself. Great value for those who are transitioning, however for those who like who they are- not the right fit."
Great product I love it. I use it daily and I wouldn't trade it for anything else. Makes my face feel wonderful.
"This product really works I am more confident since using this product, i am simply beautiful and i am using this to my full advantage. Thank you"
"Hydrating and Smoothing! I'm in my late twenties, so my relationship with anti-aging creams is on more of a preventative basis. I like to look for creams that will help with minimizing the appearance of pores and even out my skin tone - this cream did just that! After using this for a weeks, I did notice that each morning my skin felt softer and brighter. I haven't felt the need to reach for my concealer to even out redness nearly as much and I feel more confident going out without makeup on. If you are younger and are writing off anti-aging creams because you think they don't apply to you yet, think again! These creams do more than just help restore the look of youthfulness, but also improve your complexion. The low-price point is also a huge plus when you start comparing this to the myriad of other anti-aging products out there. Why pay a premium when you can purchase this at a lower price and receive the same benefits! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Finally something I can use I have very sensitive skin so I really had no expectations for this. Most products usually produce itching or a breakout due to some ingredient or other, so I didn't expect to be able to use it for more than a couple of days. Surprisingly, I had no bad reactions to it. It goes on light, and is not highly scented (I consider that a plus). I have never understood why face creams have to have such strong floral scents. The best surprise was how well it worked on my drier cheeks without making my oilier areas really greasy as well. It just seemed to get absorbed straight into my skin. I really can't say whether it combats all the signs of aging like it suggest, but I do know, that my skin feels much softer and definitely less dry especially now that it's winter. Over all the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer was a big surprise, surpassed expectations and something I have definitely added to my nightly routine.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I've just finished my trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer... And I was wanting some more ! :) At first, I wasn't sure if I was going to use it all, since I didn't like the fragrance! It smells like old fashioned makeup/cosmetics. I didn't like its color either ! :P But, the rich texture of the moisturizer got to me ! It glides on and seeps in without leaving a sticky feeling and really nourishes your skin. (And the smell fades quickly! :)) I didn't immediately see a difference in the appearance of my skin but I could feel it was well hydrated. (Especially since it's winter season and my skin gets so dry it hurts...) Now, after 2 months of using it, I can see that my pores look minimized and the fine lines around my mouth are less visible because my skin isn't cracked and dry anymore. It has provided me a healthy glow effect ! I was really surprised to see how this moisturizer deeply penetrates the skin to leave you feeling and looking replenished ! I strongly recommend it... And it's available in Fragrance-Free ! (Yay !! :)) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Moisturizer Over the past many months I have been on a medication that has caused my skin to be exceptionally dry. I was pleased to find that the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer was great at replenishing the moisture to my face and neck. One of my biggest pet peeves with facial moisturizers is when they take forever to absorb. Thankfully the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer absorbed quickly and did not leave any residue behind. It has a pleasant but very mild scent and is easy to apply - a small amount really does go a long way. This product boasts that the unique vitamin complex helps to fight seven signs of aging. While I don't have noticeable issues with all seven categories, I have noticed that my laugh lines are much less noticeable and I do find that the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer gives my skin a nice glow. I look forward to continuing to use this product in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I've had good results with other Olay products and was excited to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. The product claims the following: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles Evens skin tone appearance Enhances brightness Minimizes the look of pores Visibly reduces age spots Restores firmness Replenishes moisture Initial impressions: cream is rich but not greasy and absorbs quickly into the skin. Fragrance is pleasant and not overpowering. Skin felt soft and velvety immediately after application. In addition to using it daily on my face after my morning shower, I also applied it to the top of my left hand as a way to monitor any changes (vs. my right hand) after a month of using it. After this trial period, the skin on top of my left hand was brighter and felt softer and firmer than the skin on top of my right hand. The skin on my face looks more even-toned and less blotchy than before. While my almost-50 year-old skin needs a stronger moisturizer, I will happy include this product along with my regulars in my daily skin routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Never too early to start anti-aging products It's never too early to start your anti-aging routine. I received this product as a free trail from Olay as a part of a Bzz Campaign. I have Been using this product for several days and so far I am really happy with it. The moisturizer goes on very smooth. The pump applicator is very sturdy, and dispenses just the right amount of product. I use th Olay Total Effect 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer at night as it is a little heavier on my face. My skin feels very soft and does remains moisturizer throughout the day. This cream works well with my combination skin, moisturizing the dry areas and doesn't leave the oiler areas feeling greasy. and the cream leaves my dry patches feeling greasy. I have not noticed any changes to the fine lines on my face, overall my skin does appear to be brighter and my skin tone seems more balanced and even. I will be continuing to use this product, and will be recommending it to friends. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Another Wonderful Product from Olay I was excited to be accepted to be a part of this trial. I have long been a user of other Olay products, but have only used the basic version of their moisturizers. I have pretty much used up my sample size bottle of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer. I am very happy with the product and its results. It has a nice light scent, and works well with my skin. My only complaint (if you want to call it that) is that I found that I had to use more of this product that I do when using other moisturizers. However, it is a bit thicker consistency than my usual moisturizers. I am very likely to purchase this product in the future, especially since it is offered in both fragrance-free, and with SPF 15 sunscreen. I haven't priced it out yet though, if it is much more expensive than my current brands, I will only purchase it if I find it on sale. Otherwise, I will definitely be recommending this product to my friends and family. Great job Olay! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This stuff is great, but not for me (yet) I was home for the holidays and happened to be chatting with my female family members about skincare, when one of them remarked that my face looked glowier and more plump compared to the last time she saw me. I wasn't wearing any makeup, and I didn't gain any weight, so I'm assuming that what she saw was because of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I mentioned that it was also extremely moisturizing (I have dry skin, winter makes things worse) and had a nice scent. I've been using it every night for the last two weeks and am very pleased with the results - this was further confirmed by the fact that other people have noticed a change in my skin! However, since I'm pretty young and don't have age spots, and minimal fine lines and wrinkles, I haven't noticed a drastic difference in terms of those claims (it's not the product's fault though!) I passed on the rest of my trial size to my mom and I'll see how she likes it and then I'll report back. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great for combination skin! I think... *I have had difficulties with other moisturizing products I've used in the past because I have combination skin (oily T-zone with dryness around my nose and mouth). My skin also gets even more dried out and flaky in the wintertime. This cream isn't greasy, and doesn't exasperate the oiliness of my skin. It's also very hydrating, and has been effective at relieving my dried out skin this winter! The moisturizer has a light scent to it, which isn't overpowering - something I appreciate, since I'm sensitive to perfumey smells. And I've noticed a brighter, more even skin tone since I started using the product a couple weeks ago. Personally I don't think the trial size is useful for me, as I generally like to buy creams like this in larger quantities so that I don't have to run to the store as frequently. However, I could see how it could be beneficial for people who aren't sure whether this cream will be a good fit for their skin type to have the option to pay a smaller price for a smaller product size.

"The best I have tried At 62 years of age I have tried a lot of different products, some cheaper some costing much more. I always go back to Olay. The cleansers leave my face feeling clean without drying. Night time creams are not greasy and easily absorbed. I love everything about Olay and will not waste any more money on inferior products. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A good start to healthy skin. First off I want to say that I have extremely dry skin. I'm on a medication for a spinal condition that reeks havoc on my skin, hair and nails. Around my hair lines I will even develop some dry patches that will become flaky. I live in a very dry climate that doesn't help towards this so a good skin moisturizer is very important to me. I was excited to start the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer . I have been using it faithfully since receiving and have noticed some improvements. The flakiness around my hairline has greatly decreased. Overall 80 improvement. My skin appears to be brighter. The fine lines around my eyes appear to have lessened. My skin feels soft and silky, has a nice roast glow to it. Last week I ran into a friend and she asked what my secret was...she said that I looked great. So it's obvious to me that I'm not the only one noticing these results. I will continue to use Olay as part of my daily routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Lovely smelling, good moisture for summer months I have just recieved my package in the mail. I have had one day to try the product and so far this is my review- I will return once I have had the chance to form more of an opinion but for now: Packaging: Nice looking, easy to use pump- minimizes wasted product which is great! Smell: It does have a fresh smell, not overpowering but definite scent to it. Some may not enjoy this but I find it nice. I understand there is a frag. free option though! Texture: Goes on smoothly and absorbs, not greasy or heavy Moisture: Absorbs well but is maybe more suitable for summer, in cold winter months where I am from (Ontario Canada) It can be quite cold and my skin is extra dry...it could provide more moisture for this time of year... I would be interested in a version for dry skin for this. Sensitivity: I have pretty fair and sensitive skin and this did not annoy or anger my skin so far...which is great! Often times this happens on first try! Signs of aging: Too early to tell, hope to have a better idea on this second review This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay 7 in One... A-OK Over the last year or so I have noticed that I have two age spots one on my cheek and one on my neckline. When I saw that Olay Total Effects 7 in One promises to reduce age spots I was very excited to try it. I used the moisturizer faithfully until the last drop was dispensed. The spot on my cheek is almost gone! Frankly, I'm impressed! How many products promise such things but end up disappointing you in the end. The other spot has faded considerably but not as much as the one on my cheek. I also have uneven skin tone, some blotchy redness here and there, I didn't notice a change in the reduction of the redness at all. The moisturizer is very light and goes on smoothly. I like the design of the dispenser, it gives you just the right amount to cover your face and neck area. I liked this product, I will have to put it on my shopping list so I can continue using it. I'm curious to see if it will erase those pesky age spots completely! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Almost a 5 out of 7 effects I really like olays 7 effects. I was super excited to get rid of the tiny wrinkles I have, but more important I wanted my skin tone and awkward redness to blend a bit. I am not old yet so the wrinkle part isn't a big deal and I'm glad for that because I haven't noticed a difference in my fine lines on my face since using this cream. What makes up for this for me though, is how much my complexion has improved! Little spots on my face have virtually dissapeard and the redness I had has cleared up majorly. I am very impressed. Since I did use the tiny trial bottle as directed it ran out before I could complete the four week test, so I got the full size bottle. I love this product and I say 4 stars at this moment. It might change to 5 stars when I give my last review once I've had a little more time with it. I took before and after pictures and I will be attaching them to this review and i will continue this to see how much it really does help the naked face :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I am liking this product! I was eagerly awaiting my trial size Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer so when it came I was very excited. I have always been a love of Olay product so was feeling very lucky to be able to review this new one. When I opened the package I was a little disappointed that there were no coupons as with other samples but was pleasantly surprised at the size of the Trial bottle. The packaging is very similar to other Olay products. I have been using the product for 5 days now and have been pleasantly surprised. I am used to products irritating my skin but this product is not too perfumed and goes on very smooth. I live in a northern town so we have temperatures of about -17 on average right now. I have absurdly dry skin. The first application took two pumps as my skin was so dry, but after 5 days I am happy to report that I only need half a pump, and my face stays moisturized all day. I have not felt any greasy feeling. I have yet to notice any of the age defying effects it is supposed to have, but that would be a shock after only 5 days. I will report after a few weeks to see if it helps with my age spots. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A Good Daily Face Cream I have been using the cream for a few weeks now and have found it to be a good daily use cream. It goes on smooth, isn't too thick or thin (good consistency), has a pleasant fragrance that isn't overpowering, and moisturizers quite well. Although, I find in the winter months, I could use a tad more moisture on my skin. As to all the benefits that apparently come with using the cream, I'm a bit skeptical. I haven't noticed my fine lines or wrinkles improve and didn't really notice a difference with reducing the appearance of pores. I also don't really see a restoration of firmness either. That said, I don't really believe there is a moisturizer that can actually do all of the things Olay claims to be able to do. I mostly use moisturizer to do just that, moisturize and feel good on my skin and the Olay Total Effects moisturizer does do that. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Moisturize, Moisturize, Moisturize! I have purchased a few boutique quality face creams in pursuit of smoother skin and a tighter neck and despite their high price tags and claims of effectiveness, I have been disappointed. I am 43 years old and am very fortunate to have very few lines on my face and around my eyes however I am unhappy with the appearance of my pores and what I refer to as my chicken neck. While I can't say that Olay Total Effects has cured either problem I am happy with the appearance of my skin on my face. I also love the how easy it was to smooth the lotion into my skin and it's light , pleasant scent. My skin instantly felt moisturized and all tightness disappeared. I am hopeful that the texture of my skin will continue to improve and who knows, I may get lucky and lose my chicken neck in the process! I will definitely be purchasing a full size bottle as soon as I use up my current stash! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Softer skin in just a couple of weeks! I've been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for just a couple of weeks, and I'm already in love! I've used Olay products in the past, but found them to be a little too greasy, and my skin would break out. Not this time! The 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is not greasy at all, and in fact, has made my skin noticeably softer. It's been brutally cold and windy out the last couple of weeks, but my Olay lotion has kept my skin hydrated! I've also noticed a slight decrease in the discolouration of my skin. This is something that will likely take more time to even out, but I'm willing to give this moisturizer a shot! If you're looking for a product to combat the signs of aging, try the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It's far less expensive than the boutique brands, and the upside: it actually works! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good Moisturizer..and maybe a little bit more After more than a month using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I can say that I was very surprised that the product lasted long enough to give a fair review, the size appears very small so Olay really must have minimized the amount of packaging in order to maximize the amount of product which is AWESOME!!! My skin is more hydrated so it definitely looks better and the wrinkles aren't quite as obvious, however that is nothing more than any other decent moisturizer will do, I have noticed no change in skintone BUT, and here's the best ... my make-up goes on much better, it seems to act almost as a primer, for this reason alone I will buy the full size product as due to the silicone in most primers my skin does not tolerate them well, and I have had no issues with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Wow, just wow! I'm a skeptic by nature. There's no way that a skinny pill or a magic cream exists or we would all be perfect in our own eyes and this is the reason I love trying products like this one! Well, Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 is about as close to a magic cream as I think it can get. From the first time I used the moisturizer I noticed a difference. It's become my go to for a quick pick me up and with the added benefits of long term results you really can't go wrong. My face goes from blah and uneven to glowing and even within seconds of application. I've definitely noticed some of the finer lines disappearing and my skin is noticeably softer as well. I truly can't wait for Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 to hit the stores so I can replenish my secret weapon in the daily fight against looking like an over tired mom of 3 young kids -) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"keeps my skin hydrated I believe that this product has helped improve my skin's texture and keeps my face feeling hydrated and supple. I use it twice a day and the cream is not greasy, since I live in a hot climate I do not want a product that clogs my pores and this cream sinks in my skin without any filmy layer sitting on top of my skin.

"Olay Total Effects moisturizer review If you are looking for a moisturizer that hydrates and brightens the appearance of your skin then you should consider trying out the Olay Total Effects anti-aging moisturizer. From my own personal experience after using this moisturizer daily for several weeks now I find that it helped to even out my skin tone and it makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. I have oily combo skin and sometimes I do worry that a moisturizer might be to greasy and make my skin more oily. This moisturizer doesn't make me anymore oily at all. I feel like it provides the perfect amount of moisture for my oily combo skin, it's not to greasy at all. I like the light fresh scent of this moisturizer as well. I didn't find that this moisturizer helped to diminish any of my dark spot or fine lines. This moisturizer is ideal for hydrating the skin and brightening the skin.

"feels very nice on my face I was skeptical going in to this campaign. I have crazy sensitive skin, especially on my face so I was worried it would burn and / or make me splotchy. The first couple times I tried it I added some argan oil to it. I stopped doing that though because I wanted the product to speak for itself. It is very light and left my skin feeling really soft. I experienced no side effects that I usually get from these types of creams. I've also noticed quite a reduction in the redness of my skin and fine lines have faded a bit. This was not a huge sample so I'm definitely going to have to get some more to add to my face army. Last week I even got carded at the liquor store...yaay me! I've included before and after shots...they speak volumes as to how it worked out for me. I feel lovely! You can too...it's all about the right products and good routine!

"Magic in a Bottle Once again, I put Okay Total Effects 7 to the test. We recently went away on vacation and the sun always increases the brown spots on my face. I used my Okay Total Effects 7 and was pleasantly surprised at how it managed to control the brown spots from spreading and getting darker. I came home with a nice tan and not dark brown blotches as usual. My face was also smoother and more moisturized. This cream is amazing! You would think it's greasy by how well it moisturizes your skin, but it isn't. It blends in your skin leaving it a youthful glow. This is the first time I recieved a product from BzzAgent and actually went out to buy it before I even finished the sample. I love how my pores look smaller and my face has a smoother glow to it. Even the lines on my neck see to have faded! Okay Total Effects 7 have made a believer out of me! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
It works wonders for combo skin It makes putting on my makeup go alot smoother Great results in just days and it smells WONDERFUL!
"Perfect for problem skin! I've been using my new trial size Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for 2 weeks now. While I haven't really noticed any decrease in skin wrinkles (I don't think I have that many yet), it's been awesome for the health of my skin in general. Living in Canada, winter can be a problem for most skin. The air gets cold and dry and in turn dries out the skin. I've never been able to use moisturizers on my face, or if I do, I can't use them every day because my pores tend to clog easily and cause acne break-outs. The Olay Total Effects, has been easily absorbed by my skin, and I haven't had any acne problems with it at all. The skin on my face feels soft, not dry and tight like it does every fall and winter time. Thank you to BzzAgent and Olay for giving me a chance to try this product...I will definitely be continuing to use it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Wondeful Anti-Aging Product After receiving Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer free from Olay and Bzzagent I have used it for 4 weeks and have found that my face is smoother , brighter and the fine lines around my eyes and mouth have diminished. It goes on nicely with no greasy or oily feeling like some I have tried. Not sure I look 10 years younger, but my skin does look better and the crows feet and other wrinkles have lessened a lot. I will be buying Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer as my regular moisturizer from now on in the spf version as I do really like to keep my face protected from the sun. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the one I received from Olay and Bzzagent did not have any sun protection. I highly recommend Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer for anyone wanting to reduce or help prevent the signs of aging. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A Really Nice Day and Night Cream I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 since I received it in the mail over a week ago, both in the morning and at night. I think the consistency is very nice and smooth, not too thick and not too thin. I also like the fact that it helps my foundation glide on better. I have used many, many expensive face creams and products and think that Olay, which is quite reasonably priced, stacks up against the best of them! I am 55 and have some fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and also around my mouth. I have some freckles or age spots also. My skin tone however, is quite even. Olay 7 in 1 definitely moisturizes my skin but I can't say I have seen any drastic improvement or lessening of the wrinkles or the age spots yet. Perhaps I need to use Olay Total Effects for a bit longer. I like the fact that it is fragrance free also. I will definitely be recommending Olay 7 in 1 to my family and friends, and especially to my work colleagues, who are all in their 50's and 60's and are always interested in reducing wrinkles.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Moisturizer I'm very pleased with the results I've seen with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Moisturizer. First of all, I haven't had any side effects: usually with moisturizers and lotions of this type I experience skin rashes and itchiness. I've had none of that and have been using it daily for 3 weeks now. I have extremely sensitive skin and normally shy away from using new products on my face. I tried this free trial size (mainly because it is from a brand I do trust and use.) I use Original Olay cream and have stuck with it because it doesn't cause me problems. Compared with my regular face cream, I have noticed a visible brightness in my skin as well as an evenness. I find I constantly need to apply face cream because my skin is very dry however I do feel Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Moisturizer replenishes my skin a little better than my other face cream (Olay Original) I've also noticed my skin looks smoother and feels smoother. I would definitely buy Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Moisturizer as I've found it all round good for my skin This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Evens out my skintone I think this product works great on the skin, aside from the fragrance. Instead of reaching for my expensive beauty moisturizers, I like using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It simply feels wonderful on my face. It is lightweight and it glides on smoothly on my skin. I don't need a lot of it. I just pump out smaller than a pearl-sized dot of moisturizer and it provides enough coverage for my face, my neck and decolletage. I apply this moisturizer every night before bedtime and I wake up in the mornings and my complexion looks very even. It doesn't dry out my face and no signs of allergic reaction to the fragrance either. I do believe that in the dry winter season, the skin needs vitamins for moisturizing and to keep your skin tone even. I struggle with dry and flaky skin. The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer helps combat my dry skin and replenishes the moisture making my skin glow and evens out my fine lines.

"Love Olay Products I have used the original Olay in the past and always found it worked well on my skin so was very excited to try the anti-aging line. Prior to getting the sample, my skin was feeling unusually dry and tight. Once I started using the 7 in 1 moisturizer, I noticed the dryness go away after about 4 days. It definitely helped to replenish the moisture in my skin while maintaining firmness. My skin felt much better, softer and brighter than the dull look it had before starting to use this product. With more moisturized skin I noticed a minimization of pores as well. I can not tell whether my fine lines or age spots have improved but again, my skin feels softer and more even over all. I liked how light this moisturizer feels right after application. I used in morning and night and did not notice any greasiness at all. It has a subtle scent that is not overpowering. I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and like the results so will continue to use it to see if there are further noticeable differences in my lines and age spots.

This product works amazing This product works amazing because it not only makes my skin smell great it also keep my skin smooth n healty
It feels so light weight Adding a little to my face and neck daily. I just use a small amount and it seems to activate my own natural moisture. I am going to be 53 years old tomorrow. I've been using this product since I was 38 years old. If I didn't have it I think I would look a lot older today than I do. Thank you for this great product.

"Woo-hoo! Olay Total Effects 7 in One is here! I was so excited when my trail-size of Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer arrived at my door. I could not wait to try it. I have been using the product for three days now and here are my initial thoughts. First off, the packaging is very nice. The pump appears very sturdy and distributes just the right amount of the moisturizer. Before I review the actual product, here are a few things about me. I am in my late thirties with combination skin - oily around the nose and chin and dry patches on my cheeks and forehead. My main concerns are uneven skin tone and appearance of some fine lines across my forehead. Now for the product... The moisturizer has a faint but very pleasant scent. It went on very smooth, however, it does feel a little heavier than I am used to. That being said, three days in and my skin does feel very soft and smooth. I will definitely continue to use Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer and will report back in a few weeks on its longer term results. Thanks Olay for the opportunity to try out this new product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice Face Cream It's pretty fun to try out new products for my skin, especially before its available in stores. Having sensitive skin, I am not interested in wasting money on something that might not work for me, so this bzzkit was perfect for me! Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer is not my favorite in terms of texture and how it feels on my skin but it is pretty nice overall in its application and performance. I find it works best for me when my skin is dry (like cold winter months) or even at night since it's a heavier face cream than I'm used to using. Normally I use a serum in the day time that is lightweight and I find this olay more penetrating on my skin and adds a bit more of a base I'd say it's perfect for foundation or pressed powder. I told my mom about Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer since she's big into face creams and she tried a little bit on her skin. She liked it a lot!

"A month later..... I was very hopeful when I received the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer sample, and started using it the day it arrived. The main feature I was excited about was that the cream was suppose to fight the fine lines and wrinkles. I'm in my early forties and I've noticed that I have a few lines between my brows and dark circles under my eyes. I've always fought against the dearness under my eyes do the brightening possibility also appealed to me. I have religiously used the cream once and sometimes twice a day since receiving my sample. The creme is a little on the think side which I prefer and it didn't take much to apply on my face. My skin felt moisturized and smooth, not sticky like some other brands I've used. So after a month of using this, I have noticed that the lines between my brows are less prominent but I don't see a change in the darkness/brightness of the skins under my eyes. For that reason I will continue to use a Clinique product under my eyes but may use the Olay Total Effects as a secondary moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Thumbs up OLAY I gernally have sensitive skin and usually a pretty simplistic cleansing regime. My mother and grandmother grew up on Olay so naturally I am aware of its great reputation and benefits. The texture is very silky and the absence of the scent was reassuring as I do have sensitive skin. After only a week my face was noticeably softer and smoother. I tend to have combination skin and I found this moisturizer helped minimize the build up of grease. Regime I normally wash my face with an oil free cleanser exfoliate...pat try and then would apply the Olay moisturizer. In the morning I would wash my face again with a warm wash cloth and re-apply. My face stayed moisturized and greasy free all day. I didnt feel any build up and found that my skin was so smooth. I dont have many wrinkles but I did notice an improvment in my skintone and uneven spots very quickly. I would reccommend this product as part of any beauty process. The earlier you start taking care of your skin the better to reduce fine lines, age spots and wrinkles. Great product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great but a little greasy This moisturizer smells excellent and moisturizes well, maybe too well. I applied this moisturizer before bed (before a spot treatment) as well as in the morning before applying foundation and i found that after about 5 hours my skin was visibly oil slick. I have combination skin and it is difficult to find a moisturizer that does not make me oily or break out so this problem very well may be me and not the moisturizer! I do agree that it helps to smooth fine lines, evens skin tone, enhances brightness, restores firmness and DEFINITELY replenishes moisture... however it did not do a great job of minimizing pores. I do not have age spots so I cannot comment on the effects on age spots. I will use the rest of this tester as it smells great and the other effects are good, however I will continue to use SpectroGel Face Lotion as it does not make my skin as greasy. This is a great product, but maybe not for us combination/oily skin folks! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Beautiful, Radiant Skin in a Bottle I received Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for free from Olay. I've been using this product for about a month now and, I have to say, I'm impressed. I don't have any wrinkles or lines on my face and I don't think I need to look 10 years younger just yet, so I haven't seen any difference in that way. However, I have noticed my skin is much smoother, softer, and brighter than it was before. I usually use an anti-aging serum and then a moisturizer on my face everyday so I love that it's like two products in one. I also have very sensitive skin and I haven't found any negative side affects as a result of changing products.The bottle itself also makes it very easy as it dispenses just the right amount of product so you're not using more than you need to. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for the perfect anti-aging moisturizer. It's never too early to start fighting signs of aging!

"Okay Total Effects Ok, so when I opened the box from my free trial from Olay Total Effects, I really wondered if it would work, I mean it's just a cream and probably gimmicky... However, it is an Olay product which has been around for a million years - my grandmother used it and she has skin as soft as a baby's bum!! We have all come to know the name Olay and know it as a tried and tested and true product!! So, back to this exact product - Olay Total Effects. I liked that this went on without a greasy I just fixed a car kinda feeling, and you didn't need much either! I put it on my face and neck, and wouldn't you know by the time I finished the bottle I can see a slight difference, mostly in my light brown aging (I'm only 39) and sun damage spots... Some lightened or even disappeared! I also noticed firmer lines in my face! I would like to try this product longer to see what else it can do for my youthful appearance!! Heading out to Christmas shop and buy me some Olay Total Effects cream. Thank you BZZ Agent for hooking me up with a free sample from Oil of Olay Total Effects!!

"Smoother appearing skin I was impressed that Olay Total Effect 7-1 anti aging mostizuring did not leave my skin feeling oily. A lot of moisturizers leaving an oily/residue feeling. I also found that it soaked in quickly, and that I didn't need a lot of it to do my face. I don't have wrinkles (yet) but I do have noticeable pores, which leaves my face looking rough. I also have lines under my eyes. After using Olay Total Effect 7-1 anti aging mostizuring for a few days I noticed that its unique vitamin complex made my skin appear smoother. It also felt smoother and softer! The lines under my eyes isn't as noticeable. I never felt like I needed any anti ageing creams, as I'm only in my early 30's... However after using this product I am considering buy it, as I haven't found anything else as of yet to smooth out my skin. I'm not sure if you are really suppose to, but the one day I did apply Olay Total Effect 7-1 anti aging mostizuring cream and then after leaving it for a few minutes applied my makeup. Most of the time I did apply it at night. I also found I didn't need to apply it every day, even on day two I had soft skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A Perfect Christmas Gift To Yourself I was very excited to test out the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I know Olay has a good reputation for skin care and my mum has used it for over 40 years. The first thing I noticed about the cream was the lovely smooth texture, it glided on my skin and was instantly absorbed the smell was fine, not amazing but not awful either. The skin did not feel greasy and I could apply my make-up straight after applying the cream. I used the cream in the morning after my shower and in the evening after removing my makeup - to my face and neck. I am very fair skinned (i have red hair mixed in with my blonde) and I think I am prone to fine lines even though I am only 44. After using the cream for the allocated time I cant see any visual reduction in the fine lines but my face does feel more mosturised and I actually really love the cream. It just feels better, not as tight and a lot smoother and I think it looks brighter. I will purchase the cream again as a little Xmas gift to myself and although I dont look ten years younger I definately recommend this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good moisturizer for the Winter I have used many Olay products in the past, in particular their classic moisturizer for sensitive skin and was excited to try out this new product. The packaging itself it quite nice, I really like the pump nozzle because it eliminates the possibility of bacteria becoming introduced into my moisturizer with repeated handling. The smell was okay, very subtle but I prefer moisturizers with no fragrance whatsoever. The application was very smooth, but I did find it a bit thick. I think that this moisturizer is great for the Winter months but I can't see myself using this in the Summer. I would recommend using small amounts as it can feel quite 'cakey' if you over do it! I think it is still a little early to see any improvements in skin appearance, but I honestly can say that my skin feels smoother and I am pretty happy with this product. Overall, I did like this product, I would use it again for deep moisturizing in the Winter but it may be a little too heavy for the Summer months. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Regenerist I have been using Oil of Olay products for over 40 years. I have been using Regenerist Deep Hydratio Regenerating Cream since it first was released. I am 71 years young and I do NOT have wrinkles. My face is clear and smooth. I would never thing of using anything but Oil of Olay products on my face and on my body.

"So far so good!! I really excited when I saw this campaign open up in BzzAgent. I always curious and want to try this Olay Total effect 7 in 1 anti-Aging Moisturizer but i still have lots of moisturizer from the store brand that I been using. I feel that the one that i am using does not do any good to me anymore maybe because of I am getting older or because of lack of sleep due to my baby. I have been using it from the day 1 that I got, apply on my face day and night. 1 pump is just the perfect amount for my face and neck. After 4 weeks i slowly feel that my face getting radiant, soft, feel more fresh, reduce my age spots and it moisture my skin over night. I am not committing to buy it yet I still want to finish this trial bottle first and see from that. Overall, I feel that the product does what it said at some point but my most concern is my skin firmness and I do not see any different yet I guess it have to give the product some time to work. Thanks to BzzAgent to let me in on this campaign!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good Mosturizer For Skin Tone! I love face moisturizers, and have been trying to find one that took away a bit of my morning redness, reduces my pores, and helps slow down the fine lines that are increasing on my face. The sample container I received is a push bottle where one push is WAY too much, but its hard to stop the amount that comes out. I dont anticipate my 15ml sample lasting me very long. There is very little scent scent, and it doesnt over-moisturize my face, nor does it make it feel too tight. Over the last week of testing, I havent noticed any change in the fine lines on my forehead or eyes this likely takes a period of time much longer than a week. My redness does go away and my pores definitely appear smaller since using this moisturizer and stays clear and bright all day long. I have no age spots to combat (yay), and firmness isnt an issue yet at my mid-30s age. Overall, it is a decent moisturizer but for the price point, I feel I can find better value with alternate products. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Welcome back to Olay! I used to use Olay when I was younger, like in my teens. I loved the way it felt on my skin. Then I started breaking out and I switched to oil free version, but unfortunately that didn't help my skin. I stop using this brand and started using various other expensive brands trying to find one that suited my skin. I was happy to get a chance to use this product, as it is expensive and I was weary on whether it was going to suit my skin. The first time I used the moisturizer I broke out. I was disappointed but I wanted to give the moisturizer a chance. I was happy with the feel of the product on my skin and I absolutely love the scent of it. I have noticed a little bit of a difference on my skin. I notice my skin is smoother and thankfully I haven't been breaking it out. My skin is definitely brighter. I love the look if my skin. I would recommend this product, my only wish was it was cheaper however sometimes you pay for quality and I think that I would be paying for quality.

"Perhaps not 10 years younger I am constantly on the hunt for a good moisturizer that perfect 10 so to speak. So when BzzAgent gave me the opportunity to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I jumped at the chance. I am hesitant to buy new ones as I try a few times and then they sit as they are just not it. With this moisturizer I was pleasantly surprised. It doesn't have the old lady smell I previously associated Olay products with. It has a nice hip smell almost masculine which is refreshing. Did it make me 10 years younger mmmmm probably not (but I look pretty young anyway). What it did do is hold up to the yoyo weather we have from -27---1 in one week. it has moisturized without extra oil on my face. I haven't broken out with it, and it has smoothed my skin. I havn't worn foundation in a number of months as I have noticed my face becoming rougher and the foundation not sitting right. I thought it was the foundation turns out it was my skin needing more moisture. Good job guys!!! This is a 9/10 product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I'm looking younger!!! Olay Total Effects 7 is an anti-aging moisturizer that I have been using everyday for the past 2 months. I put in on first thing in the morning, wait a few minutes then apply my make up which goes on smoothly. From the Olay site Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free Anti-Aging Moisturizer is reformulated with 40 more vitamins for an effortless look. Its VitaNiacin Complex fights the 7 signs of aging with vitamin B3. The 7-in-1 formula combines humectants and skin conditioners to help keep skin hydrated. Plus, its vitamins and antioxidants hydrate to help reduce the look of age spots, minimize the appearance of pores, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. This fragrance-free face moisturizer nourishes with hydration to visibly reduce signs of aging for younger-looking skin. I am already starting to see a glow that I didn't have before and my skin doesn't feel tight. I love that it's fragrance free. I will update in a few weeks to see it I see more changes. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not Too Bad! I was really looking forward to trying the Olay Total Effects 7 In 1 cream, and I have used it every day until my sample bottle ran out. Pros: it definitely helps even skin tone and lighten dark areas. My skin stayed soft and hydrated without becoming oily or blocking pores. I have some sun damage, and it appears that the Olay has smoothed my skin and minimized my pores. You can use this on its own or under foundation I don't wear makeup every day but as the Olay evened my skin, foundation wasn't needed! Cons: the scent wasn't the best. It did not smell like sunblock, or unscented I can't put my finger on the scent it reminded me of. I have one very noticeable line below my eyebrow and this cream did not really reduce the appearance. Also, no lasting difference in the circles under my eyes. Need to know: a little goes a long way, so this product will be a real bang for your buck! I am eager to buy a bottle in store and hopefully continue to see improvements in my skin. Thanks Olay!

"Total Effects The only reason I did not give this a five is that I found it makes certain areas of my face too oily...like my nose. Otherwise I highly recommend this product from Olay. The same I received from BzzAgent is going a long way with me. I find that I don't have to use as much as other types of creams to get a better effect. I have noticed some of the smaller lines on my face smoothing out just a little and I'm sure with time it'll work even better. The scent is something I really appreciate as it reminds me of the products my mom used when I was younger. It feels like this is a product I will keep buying and that I will definitely recommend to my friends and family. I think the thing I would want to know before I used this, is what claims does this product make and what can I expect from it in the long run. I guess I will have to keep using it in order to find that out. :) I'm adding a picture from today because I can't figure out how to show both before and after at the same time. :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Its that time ago. BzzAgent sent me a sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Though I may not have wrinkles yet, its never too early to fight the signs of aging, and this is from a brand (Olay) that I trust, so I jumped at this chance! As an Esthetician I know the benefits of starting early. Even without me have wrinkles I still found this moisturizer beneficial. I have some looser skin around my eyes and found it helped to tighten that up. I also have combination skin, dry on my cheeks, oily t-zone, and I found this was well balanced for both areas. It has a soft, unoffensive scent, and it faded nicely. It did feel a bit heavy as it went on, but like the scent that faded, and then was unnoticeable. Though I am not the target market for this product right now, its something in about 5 to 10 years I hope is still on the market so I can use it! If you are starting to show signs of aging, or have a few too many laugh lines, I highly recommend Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer!

"Pleasant so far... I have been using this product for a few weeks now and the bottle is almost empty. My first impression was positive on the product presentation. Cute bottle and easy to use. I prefer a bottle that has a pump rather than having to dig out cream from a jar. I find the product had a very pleasant light scent. It is refreshing and I enjoy it. The product applies very easily and smoothly. It is non-greasy, very light feeling, and this time of year, my face is really dry and I look forward to applying the product each day. To be honest, in regards to the anti-aging benefits this product advertises, I am unable to say that I've noticed a significant difference. I'm not sure if it takes longer to start seeing the signs or if the product sample is too small. That being said, I still enjoy using the product for it's smoothness and for general daily use and depending on the price it will sell for (and value for the size the product will come in), it is still a product I may consider purchasing when it goes on the shelves.

"Mostly Happy the Effects of Total Effects by Olay Before I jump into my review, I have to mention that I am a Sephora junkie. I love trying out new face creams, moisturizers, serums, cleansers, etc... Unfortunately, this love comes with a hefty price tag that I don't love quite as much. Therefore, I was quite anxious to see if I could get the same effects that I have seen with pricier products with Total Effects by Olay. The first time I applied it, I was really liked the smell and feel of the product. My skin has a tendency of being oily so I am always quite fussy with my moisturizers. I was pleased that my skin didn't seem oilier, yet, was nice and soft. Since then, I have used it every morning and night and am pleased with the product. I cant say that my skin looks younger, however, it definitely doesn't look worse and it feels great. The biggest negative that I have noticed so far is that it does seem to clog my pores a bit more than other moisturizers that I have used. However, if I make sure to exfoliate, it is not much of a big deal. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Best hydrating cream ever I wish that I used Olay Regenerist deep hydrating cream years ago before I spent a fortune on expensive brand creams that did not work effectively. Once you use it you will never choose another cream, in fact, for all other creams you will opt to use only Olay!! The best especially the 7 effects and the eye creams. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects Does It All I've been using Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 anti-aging moisturizer for 6 weeks. At first I wasn't sure if it would work as well as described. Now after 6 weeks, I am totally impressed! I have a pretty large dark spot at the top of my cheek. The pigmentation of the spot has definitely gotten lighter with daily use of Olay Total Effects. No other product has been able to do that! I have spent so much money on products that claim to work but end up being a waste. So happy Olay is an affordable option that honestly works. My skin tone has evened out a little better over time. I am also happy with the way Olay moisturizes without leaving any stickiness or residue that comes off on a lightly colored pillowcase. I will definitely be buying a bottle. I want it to work in the rest of this big old dark spot! Love the travel size option will be great to take anywhere! I received a travel sized bottle of this product at no cost in exchange for my own honest opinion and review.

"Moisturizer, yes...Anti-aging, not so much Well, I really liked the texture, fragrance and portioning in regards to this moisturizer. Being a person who rarely ever uses a moisturizer, I made it my goal to use it until it ran out...and I did. I found that it wasn't greasy, didn't leave a residue on my face and was quite pleasant to use. It wasn't overpowering with regards to the fragrance and The scent didn't linger. The pump on the bottle dispensed just enough - not too little, not too much for one use which I really appreciated. I like it as a moisturizer, but didn't notice the reduction of fine lines or my skin looking younger necessarily, however I don't have deep wrinkles or uneven skin tone to tart with. No one verbalized that they noticed a difference, but I'm honestly not sure how many people were really looking. My skin was softer to touch for sure. It's an incredibly nice moisturizer and I would definitely use it again - and that's a huge thing coming from a person whose skin has a tendency to react with an itchy reaction to new skin care products.

"Fantastic Anti-Aging Moisturizer I had net used the Olay products in awhile. I was intrigued to see how the moisturizer helped my skin in the past several weeks after using it. I was very happy to see results. I have skin discoloration on my face from years of being in the sun without the proper protection, coupled with fine lines from being older. Signs of aging starting to show on my face. After a few weeks, the fine lines started being less visible, they had softened, my discolouration also start to fade. I was thrilled to see the small improvements on my face. Do I feel I look 10 years younger Perhaps! I'm 48 and I have people telling me all the time that I look younger. I especially like that this moisturizer has active ingredients that work against the signs of aging. When I chose a product, I always look at the ingredients to see if the claims they make can actually happen. I'm also happy that this moisturizer is affordable and easily accessible. This moisturizer does what is says. With diligent use, you will see results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Fight aging with some class! I tried Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the first time couples weeks ago. Before getting this product, I thought it was another moisturizer with promises that never come true, But I was positively disappointed! Since the first use, I felt my skin glowing and refreshed. The cream texture is light and easily absorbed. It does not leave any white marks or sticky feeling after applying it in the recommended amount. The scent is gentle and does not hurt people with sensitive respiratory problems (like myself). The bottle itself is appealing and easy to use. Couple days after my first application, I started to feel more confident about my skin. I don't have a lot of wrinkles yet, but my skin is so damaged because of my lab work and the cold weather. I guess Olay total 7 in 1 moisturizer is perfect for women living in Canada and getting dry skin during winter. I truly recommend this product for all who could use some moist on their skin! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"pleasantly suprised! usually i find that most moisturizers make my skin breakout in whiteheads or i start getting really dull complexion (build up of flaky skin and moisture on top, i swear i exfoliate but my skin is so frustrating!). the olay total effects 7-1 anti-aging moisturizer surprised me immediately because it was light on my skin and i didn't experience that greasy, heavy feeling of most creams. i noticed that my skin tone did seem to start evening out over the next few days and my complexion was brighter. i'm still a couple years away from really having to use products that fight fine lines, but the skin around my eyes was definitely smoother than before. i've always switched back and forth on moisturizers because of my finnicky skin, but this one is absolutely one i would recommend to anyone with fussy complexions and skin types. added bonus: the pump style container means less contamination with fingertips in pots (i think a lot about that kind of thing...). This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I think it's a great moisturizer, but I have used it for almost 8 weeks now I don't see any of the results it claims to do, such as enhancing brightness to my skin, minimizing the look of my pores (as I have the infamous oily T-zone), nor reducing any dark spots, which are sometimes left behind from my occasional breakouts. That being said it still is one of the best moisturizers that I have come across in a long time. The lotion goes on smoothly, has a subtle scent, it does makes my skin feel good, although it does feel just slightly sticky. I do find that the pump does disperse a lot of product, but that's ok, as I use it on my neck as well, so none of it goes to waste. I also like that this moisturizer has NOT caused me any breakouts from using it, which is a big bonus for me! Unlike some users, I sometimes prefer products that do NOT contain SPF because I don't want those ingredients on my skin. It's nice to know that Olay offers such a lotion because good SPF-free products can be hard to find. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"My experience with Olay I was pleased to find out I would be receiving this product to test. I am very familiar with the Olay brand my grandmother used their products for years, and I currently have a bottle of their beauty fluid in my make-up drawer. I have very sensitive skin and this is always a concern when trying a new product. I initially tested the moisturizer on the skin on my hand and waited 24 hours before testing on my hand. There was no irritation, which was a great sign, as my hands were already sensitive to the cold weather and extra hand washing that winter brings. I did notice that it does have a fairly strong fragrance, as I noticed it throughout the morning on my testing hand. Even though I do have sensitive skin, I am a rather difficult customer, because I still do enjoy fragrance in my facial products. Because of this, I enjoyed the fresh scent, but it is worth noting that it was rather strong, and someone sensitive to scent might be bothered. The cream applied very smoothly to the skin on my faceI did not have to tug or blend heavily to rub it in. It felt very moisturizing and left my skin with a nice glow. I do have one age spot (so far!) and though I did take care to apply it to this spot, I have not noticed a decrease in its appearance. To be fair, I think more time would be beneficial for this task. I do find that my skin seems to have a nicer tone since wearing Total Effects, but I think I would need longer term use to find a radical change. For me, though, the chance to improve skin tone and fine lines without harsh ingredients is very appealing. I find retinol really bothers my skin, so the Olay is a good chance to find improvement without the irritation. I think this is a product I would consider purchasing and I think offering the trial size is a very smart option for people wanting to try something new without committing to a months-long regime that might not appeal. I have not yet tried an Olay product I didn't like and the Total Effects is no exception. I am pleased with the product so far, but the real test of time will be regular use over several months.

"This product is great for reducing wrinkles After everyday usage of the Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream, I have noticed the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth have greatly reduced. My face looks a lot younger and I feel a lot better about how I look. I'm 59 years old and women in my family tend to show our age in the face and I think this product is great.

"So far, so good for the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Thanks to BzzAgent, I was given the chance to try out the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. This 15 mL trial size format comes with a wonderful pump to dispense the product (so no scooping out product from a jar and no losing product when you drop the container). The moisturizer itself is a very light pink color. The consistency of the moisturizer is thick, yet spreadable. I pumped out some of the product on the back of my hand and when I turned my hand over, the product didn't budge. This moisturizer leaves behind a completely matte finish (unlike the greasy aftermath left behind by my previous night cream). I don't notice immediate moisture to my skin after application, but after having the product on for a few hours my skin feels hydrated. So far, I have not had a problem with skin irritation. I have blemish-prone skin and this product has not caused any blemishes or redness. The packaging mentions that this product won't clog pores (because it's oil free) and fast-absorbing. I agree with both of these statements. with The formula of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer contains vitamins B3, B5, and E. A downside for some would be that the product also contains parabens. Be careful applying this around the eye area if you have oily eyelids as this product can really sting the eyes! Now as for the scent, it's light and mild. If you've used Olay Quench or Olay Complete basic moisturizers, the smell is kind of similar to those products. The fragrance is unnecessary especially since it's being applied to the face, which is why I'm giving this particular scented version 4 stars. For those with sensitive noses, I'd highly recommend going with the fragrance-free version. I've been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for 2 weeks now, so I can't report any dramatic effects (just yet). All I notice so far is increased hydration and radiance to my skin. The claims mentioned on this package (such as minimizing the look of pores, smoothing fine lines and wrinkles, and reducing age spots) would take more than a few weeks to see.

"Very hydrating! I have recently been lucky enough to try a trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer thanks to Bzzagent. I am always wary of new creams since I tend to have reactions: noticeable redness or breakouts a few days after starting a routine. My skin needs the moisturizing agents found in all the creams but I have yet to find there right combination until now! The first thing I noticed about the cream was that it had a very pleasant, fresh and light scent. It did not feel heavy in my palm and came out smoothly from the pump (at first...we will come back to this later). I used two pumps for my first try and found that this was actually a little too much coverage so cut back to one pump for the remaining trial period and that worked just fine...and essentially doubled my usage of the bottle! I love that it went on very smooth and was easy to blend with no clumps and felt as light as air. It dried vey quickly so I was able to continue with my makeup routine without interruption which is essential since I only have a few minutes that I dedicate to this each morning. It did not leave a greasy residue like other products I've tried in true past but my skin still felt hydrated throughout the day. I have definitely noticed a brightness to my complexion since starting with Olay and am happy to report nourished skin and smoothness. I do have some fine lines around my eyes and although I haven't seen a dramatic improvement in this area I am happy with the other results and will continue using the product in the future. It also made it onto my Xmas wish list this year One of the drawbacks that I did notice, however, was the pump and bottle itself. Since this is a trial size that's not due out until February 2016, I'm not sure of the packaging for the full size version that is currently available. For my sample though, the pump seemed to leave residue so that if not cleaned after each use (or in some cases two uses) it ended to clump up at the spout which led to a crusty piece being pumped out along with the product I intended to use. Not ideal to have to dig through product to pull out the icky bits before applying, but if you remember to clean it wasn't an issue. All in all I found this to be a great product holding up to many of its claimed benefits! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Overall Final Impressions I thought I'd share my final thoughts on the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I went into this campaign with mixed expectations because I have had issues with face moisturizers in the past where they just aren't made for really sensitive skin. The company advertises that - With its vitamin-rich formula, Olay Total Effects: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles Evens skin tone appearance Enhances brightness Minimizes the look of pores Visibly reduces age spots Restores firmness Replenishes moisture The result Skin that looks up to 10 years younger after just four weeks. Here are my thoughts... 1) Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles: I did find that my skin was more hydrated and that did help with some of the finer lines that I've noticed starting to appear. I still have laugh lines but with the extra hydration they are softer. 2) Evens skin tone appearance: For me this was true, but the reason for that was they hydration - I live in the Canadian Prairies where we have had days of -18 C before the windchill -30 C with the wind chill - the extra hydration this product provided helped me to reduce the dry redness that my skin usually has this time of year. 3) Enhances brightness: I am not sure if my skin appears brighter but it is less dry which is a bonus! 4) Minimizes the look of pores: I haven't had issues with overly large pores so I haven't noticed much difference in this aspect. 5) Visibly reduces age spots: Again - I haven't had issues with Age Spots so I am not able to say how successful this product has been in this aspect. It hasn't had much effect on the freckles though :) 6) Restores firmness: I think with the renewed hydration your skin will, naturally, appear firmer. I am in my mid 30's so there hasn't been too much issue with loss of firmness at this point for me but I can see how the extra hydration helps. 7) Replenishes moisture: This product definitely meets and exceeds expectations on the moisture replenishment. My skin isn't as dry as it usually is this time of year and also appears healthier as a result. As someone with UBER sensitive skin, I really enjoyed this product, I didn't get a rash or itchiness from this product ( I wasn't using the sensitive skin one) so I will recommend this product to other users with sensitive skin who are looking to add hydration!

"Review from Weeks 1-4 OK this may end up being a longer review as I am going to try and keep a log and then post a couple of reviews on my thoughts. The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturize lists the following claims: 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles 2. Evens skin tone appearance 3. Enhances brightness 4. Minimizes the look of pores 5. Visibly reduces age spots 6. Restores firmness 7. Replenishes moisture The result Skin that looks up to 10 years younger after just four weeks. These revitalizing vitamins include the anti-aging multi-tasker Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), soothing and moisturizing Panthenol (Vitamin B5) and conditioning agent Vitamin E with antioxidant properties. Here is a little background, I am 34 and a natural red head I live in the prairies which are now entering the chilly, dry winter months. I also suffer from sensitive skin so (as this product is scented) it will be interesting to see how my skin reacts. I have also never been a regular moisturizer user which I know isnt great for my skin. Week 1: I woke up put on a light application of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It has a really nice texture to it, although the fragrance is stronger than I usually use. As my husband isnt a big fan of flowery scents, Im using it in the morning rather than at night after my shower. The scent didnt seem to linger long and after walking out into the snow (yes, we had snow it was -8 C (17.6 F) when I left). Its now been over 3 hours since I first applied the moisturizer and so far so good. My skin isnt tingling or burning which is a nice treat the fragrance seems to have faded so I am hoping this luck will last (although Im not sure my husband will be too thrilled if I end up looking 10 years younger as Im already 10 years younger than he is.lol). Week 2: The scent is still not bothering my skin which is a huge bonus. So far I am finding that my skin is feeling smoother less dry. Week 3: I had a few days that I forgot to apply this product I noticed the difference in my skin. My skin began to feel tighter slightly flakey, typical Canadian winter skin sans moinsturizer. Week 4: Weve had slightly warmer weather so Im not sure if that has helped my skin or if its all courtesy of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer.. One of the lines in my face seems a little less prominent, so Im going to continue to see how things progress. I havent noticed much difference in my skin tone, but as someone with freckles, that doesnt really surprise me. My pores dont look any smaller I havent had issues with age spots as of yet. I look forward to seeing what the next few weeks hold. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effects 7 in 1 moisturizer When I first got this sample, I'm very curious if it really does all those 7 beautiful benefits that it claims. From what I remember from a long time ago when I used Oil of Olay skin care products in my 20s, it wasn't a very good experience and since then I haven't tried any of the Olay face products. Now that I'm in my mid 30s, I noticed I have more visible pores that is my number one concern. The first time I tried the moisturizer on, the first thing that I like was the scent. I'm quite picky or sensitive about the scent of skin care products. Some products are so fragrant that it gives you a headache all day. Even though I like the product itself, but sometimes the scent could be a huge downfall that I would have to pass. This Olay moisturizer has a very subtle, soft smell to it. Not too floral which I'm not a big fan of and most of the time it is what's in a lot of skin care products. I have combination skin so at times it's very shiny. I'm curious to see if this moisturizer would make my skin more shiny after I used it. Once I tried it, I loved it. It's not greasy or gives you that sticky heavy feeling that you have on your skin with a more heavy textured cream. The product gets absorbed into the skin very quickly and it leaves the skin feels very silky soft. After I put the this on, it actually makes it more easier for me to apply the SPF foundation on. The other brand of moisturizer that I was using before I guess doesn't put up to the test during the harsh winter weather, when I put the foundation on the dry skin flakes are even more noticeable. It was kind of frustrating. I noticed that my pores have improved, and my skin feels firmer. As for the claim that it smoothes fine lines and wrinkles, I can really comment on that because I don't have needs in that area yet...maybe in a few years. My skin tone appearance did get better. This product gives you a glow after you put it on. When I looked at the moisturizer closely, it's kind of tinted and it has some sparkly shine to it, but I'm glad that it's not tinted with colors. I prefer this more than tinted moisturizer that other brands offer because most of the time the color is not something that I like or it doesn't match my skin tone. I quite like the packaging of this product. It is much better and cleaner than putting your finger in a jar. With just one pump of it, it provides enough coverage for the face and neck area. Even though this is a little bit more expensive than other skin care products that drug store / grocery store carries, but it's worth the money I think with the amount that you need for each use. This product will actually last longer than other expensive products you can purchase. Great value overall! I would totally recommend this for people with combination skin from what I've experienced because it really does moisturize your skin without that sticky, greasy feeling it leaves on your skin as soon as you put it on. That's a big factor because you don't want your face to look oily when you go out. Therefore choosing the right product for the right type of skin is important. I'm actually very impressed with Olay this time around as compared to way back when. I used to get the sense that Olay is more for more matured ski, but this product totally changed my impression and perspective about the Olay brand itself. Now I kind of want to try the SPF formula that they offer. Wonder if the outcome would be the same. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Goodbye Fine Lines The Holiday season brings with it parties, gatherings and get togethers, and often, the chance to reconnect with friends and family that we have lost touch with. Such is the case for me. I was invited to a house party just before Christmas and was surprised to bump into a former co-worker. After hugging and connecting the dots as to how each of us should end up at the same party, she grabbed my arm and said Kim! You look fabulous! Radiant! I thanked her of course, and then took the opportunity to introduce her, and a few other ladies within earshot to Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I always carry it with me for these very opportunities, so was able to pull it out of my purse and show it off. I explained how BzzAgent works, and that this was the latest product I received and was sampling. The name Olay is not not foreign and each of the ladies present started sharing their preferred Olay products. I told them how this vitamin-enriched cream glides on easily and absorbs nicely into the skin without leaving a sticky residue or feeling too heavy, that the vitamin B will help to visibly smooth fine lines, and that the brightening enhancer will help to minimize the appearance of pores and even out skin tone. While explaining all this, I took each lady's hand and pumped a small amount onto the backs of their hand and rubbed it in for them to see and feel for themselves. All were impressed at howsilky it felt, and how nice it smelled. All agreed with me that the bottle is fantastic durable, and no fingers in a jar. I told them how my skin feels hydrated, my skin tone is definitely evened out, and those fine lines seem less visible. We all cheered Yay for less visible fine lines. All agreed with me that this, like all Olay products, is a quality drugstore product, and most of the ladies present advised that they will be keeping their eyes peeled for it when it becomes available in February.

"Thoughts from a spring chicken Warning : long review ahead Okay, let's face it - I'm only 27, I don't exactly have any wrinkles. But Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is anti-AGING so that's got to be beneficial in the long run, RIGHT! ... I think so! I wanted to take my sweet sweet time with this cream before I reviewed it. I made sure I wasn't using any similar products during testing in order to get its full benefits. So let's go through the seven signs of aging list to see what I thought... 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - can't say that I had any to begin with... 2. Evens skin tone appearance - 100 YES!!! This is where I saw the best results. Before my skin was kind of blotchy. Mostly from scars due to acne but now they're not as noticeable. I'm not as self conscious as I was without foundation. Although you still won't find me in public without any! 3. Enhances brightness - I think this plays into the even skin tone category so yes, I believe it to be true. 4. Minimizes the look of pores - hmmm.. I never really noticed a difference to be honest. But it's not something I'm worried about on a daily basis. 5. Visibly reduces age spots - again, I'm pretty sure I didn't have any... 6. Restores firmness - I don't think my firmness needed restoring but my cheeks are as firm as a babies bottom ) 7. Replenishes moisture - definitely a moisturizing serum! I would almost go as far as to say slightly greasy though. I would like to add that the amount of serum you get from one pump is barely enough - 1.5 to 2 pumps is a must. Especially if you plan on using it on your neck and dcolletage. Also, it smells lovely! All in all, I think the positives outweigh the negatives. Especially if it's being used for a prolonged period of time (i.e. YEARS). To be honest, I haven't seen it on the shelf yet so until then (and unless the price is astronomical) I'll say that I'd buy it again! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Finally something my face likes! Where I live the weather here is really bad during the winter. My skin gets super dry and my face takes alot of the cold weather abuse, whether it be that I go out and play with the kids or going to the grocery store. Previous I was using a lotion on my face, but I found my face felt really heavy after applying it and it would clog my pores. I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer (trial size) for weeks now and I have to say at first I was very skeptical when I first got this product in the mail. One thing that really appealed to me was that it claimed it replenishes moisture, which I have to agree with. I only apply a small amount to cover my whole face, it stayed nice and moisturized and I didn't have any dry skin on my face. Plus it felt like my face was 'light weight' that putting this stuff on it didn't feel gunky on my face. Also one thing I noticed it gives my face the glow I had when I was pregnant, so with all the vitamins and nutrients in this product it really helps my face feel at its best. We take vitamins for our body, why not for our face! I do have fine lines on my face which I hate and I am starting to get the dreaded wrinkles. Since using this product I have noticed the lines on my face disappearing and being harder to see, which I love. I can not comment on all the signs that it helps aid in as I do not have any age spots as of yet, but so far for everything else I have seen a difference in my face. I know it won't work for everyone as everyone's body is made differently and reacts differently, but for me this products works. If you don't want to spend a lot to try it, I would recommend buying the trial size version before buying a full size bottle. The only thing you have to lose is dry skin, wrinkles, fine lines, uneven skin tone and age spots, it is worth a try in my books. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Surprised it works well but be careful if you're sensitive to smells. Thanks to Olay I received the new trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer wont be in stores until February so that I can review it and give my opinion. At first I felt it was a little greasy on my fingers but when I when I smoothed it onto my skin, it blended well and didnt leave a greasy/sticky feeling behind. The consistency is silky smooth and I didnt need to use too much in order to cover my face. My skin felt soft and it almost immediately improved the look of my skin. I went outside shortly after applying Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free Anti-Aging Moisturizer and my skin felt protected against the wind and cold weather. Not only is it priced right but Olay Total Effects Moisturizer is reformulated with 40 more vitamins: . The 7-in-1 formula combines humectants and skin conditioners to help keep skin hydrated. Plus, its vitamins and antioxidants hydrate to help reduce the look of age spots, minimize the appearance of pores, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. This fragrance-free face moisturizer nourishes with hydration to visibly reduce signs of aging for younger-looking skin. In just 4 weeks Olay Total Effects Moisturizer can: 1.) Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles 2.) Evens skin tone appearance 3.) Enhances brightness 4.) Minimizes the look of pores 5.) Visibly reduces age spots 6.) Restores firmness 7.) Replenishes moisture The only thing is that its suppose to be fragrance free but I definitely detected a soft smell. Its very gentle but I can see that it could be too much for those who are sensitive to those things. If you want a great moisturizer and are looking to improve the look and feel of your face, Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer is the one for you.

Light and moisturing I have only used this moisturizer for 3 days and I like it. It's not sticky and very light. The smell is light and fades after use. I feel like it absorbs well into my skin.

"Soft and moisturizing Throughly enjoyed the product. The cream was soft and silky, smell was lovely. Was a little bit thick however. I was not able to see a difference in skin or wrinkles with such a small sample. Would have to see it over time. Packaging was nice but would prefer a regular bottle.

"Best product that I have used I have very dry skin and the start of wrinkles around my smile lines and eyes, after using this for the last year I have noticed a big difference in my smile lines.

"Good moisturizer This was a good moisturizer, but I found that it did not smooth my fine lines oe minimize the look of my pores. It did even my skin tone and replenish moisture. My face also seemed brighter. Overall it was ok, but I think I'll stick with my regular face cream This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"It worked pretty well! I think that this was an excellent product to use. I've always been trying to find a product that will help reduce my wrinkles and make me look more youthful! This product did just that! This product is very high quality for such a reasonable price, and I actually picked one up the other day, because I love using it everyday! Now, if you have a dry skin type like me, then this will be perfect for you, because it's such a good moisturizer. This is also really good for oily type, because even though you're oily, you still have to moisturizer. Unlike most moisturizers I've tried in the past, this one is extremely light weight, and dries really quickly to a soft finish. Some other moisturizers that I've used have done a good job at moisturizing my dry skin, but they're so heavy, and take a long time to dry, and it feels like there's ten pounds sitting on my face. With this, no matter how much you use, it'll still be light. Now, I've been using the Nivea night cream for the longest time, it was the closest I could get to a good moisturizer, but ever since I got this, I through them away! Literally, it pretty much faded away almost all of my fine lines and wrinkles, it was like magic, and I felt 18 again! I will say, that I'll give it a four star rating, because I know I'm being ridiculous, but it took way longer than four weeks for me to actually start seeing results, which is okay, I'm patient, but if you're someone who wants them gone for a special occasion then, this might not be fast enough. Anyways, that was my review on this product, and I would most certainly recommend you to buy it, climb mountains, and cross oceans for this. If you're struggling with age spots, fine lines, wrinkles, etc. Go get yourself some of this! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I'm hoping with extended use it will help with some of my dark spots and redness and maybe combat future wrinkles :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."

long lasting moisturizer I live in Utah and the air is overly dry. I need a cream for day and night that can leave me feeling hydrated at the end of the day or by the time that I wake up in the morning. It has a nice scent but it's not strong. And I always prefer some scent as opposed to unscented products. I hope it's helping me to minimize aging due to dry skin and sun exposure. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"A fresh looking face I love this product. The pump dispense just the right amount of cream needed. It is smooth to apply and have a nice smell.

31 and wrinkle free Loved how it brightened and evened my skin and helped hide my pores I don't have alot of loose skin but noticed a firmness immediately as well as a nice smooth look with and without make up live it would definitely recommend This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay for soft, smooth and radiant skin. This was a great lotion for pampering my skin and keeping it soft and smooth. I have slightly oily, acne prone skin, and this is perfect for nourishing my skin with making me break out. It is perfect for using as a night cream because it does not have spf. The immediate and long term effects are amazing. My skin is smoother than it has been in a long while. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Total Effects7 I'm now noticing that my age spots are now lighter. My skin smooth and more even looking. This really is a fantastic product. It seems to be even better at this point than the other olay products I've used. I haven't checked out the price of it yet but I'm sure that with the results I'm getting after a few days it will be well worth it. This lady is sooooooooooooo pleased.

"Love Olay.... I have used alot of different facial products and so far, Olay wins.....I love the Total Effects Daily Moisturizer...I do not wear cover up so, I like the glow that this product gives to my face!!!!I do tell people what I use, so they can try it."
"Love this product I have used Olay products on a daily basis for years now. I loved this product, it smelled great, was not sticky or oily. It has made my skin appear brighter, softer and less dry. My only trouble with Olay face products is that they can be very expensive. I sometimes have to chose a less expensive product when I would rather be using Olay.

Amazing This product smells amazing like the lotion was made by the gods and love itself
Amazing!! I'm a college student and I am still getting out of my teen skin. I have oily skin and most moisturizers break me out easily or cause my skin to look oily. This did neither. It goes on beautifully and the smell is great. It absorbs quickly. I wake up and notice my skin is smooth and brighter than before. I doubt I will ever stop buying this product!!
My dry skin My face ecspecially around my nose was getting so dried out due to the cold winter weather. After 1 day of applying Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 it is like it was never dried out. Quite impresessed This review was collected as part of a promotion.

olay 7 total effects I got to say I wasn't to impressed when I received this sample because this type of cream always claims you look younger but I really do think you do.I started using it and it makes you feel great.After you use this for a while you feel like your turning back time and your skin feels so alive and glowing.Sorry my camera is broken or else I would show you.

Best Skin Ever!! I have used regular Olay until I started noticing that I was developing some dark age spots on my checks. Probably from excessive tanning when I was younger. So I switch to Total Effects. It has brightened my overall appearance and lightens the dark areas. It feels so light and soft. I just love it. I am 62 and people always tell me that I can only be early 50s.

Still loving Olay I'm loving it still. A great moisturizer. Makes my skin feel light and not greasy. Evens out my skin tone. Currently attacking the crows feet that have been making an appearance on my face. Works well with combination skin and takes care of dryness where I need it and doesn't make my skin feel yucky where I don't. Feels great under my makeup or no makeup at all.

good day moisterizer I get this and then put a SPF 30 sunscreen over it rather than to get a SPF 15 because I alreasdy have some sun damage spots from when I was younger and used no sunscreen at all. I like a good product next to my skin (Olay) and to put the sunscreen over it so the main product in contact with my skin is the moisturizer. I would use an SPF 15 if I wore facial powder or foundation. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Awesome results I've used this Oil of Olay cream since the day it arrived. I love how it works for me. During the cold, dry, winter months I always struggle with my forehead being dry, but my nose being oily. This product worked amazing to give my forehead the moisture it needs, without being oily.

Fountain of youth or close to it!! I have been using Olay 7X for 2 weeks now and have noticed such a difference in my facial appearance. The fine lines on my forehead and around my eye are less noticeable. My skin looks more even and youthful. It's almost like turning back the clock on my face!!

Olay Total Effects I really enjoyed using this product. It didn't have an odor to it which I dislike in most products. I felt that my skin was left smooth and hydrated without feeling greasy.

All the great advantages to this Olay product! This product is wonderful for your skin because it's moisturizes your skin so good and helps banish those small age lines all wemon get as they age.The more and longer you use it the better the results.
Olay Total effects really works I am trying out Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer and it has been about a week. I already notice an improvement with my skin. Skin tone is more even and less obvious fine lines. its moisturizing effect is longlasting. I like the trial size and pump delivery. very useful for travellng on the go. also its not irritating especially I have sensitive skin. So far so good and it works!

"First impressions Just received this trial size Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer last night. I was really bummed that I had already showered and so I had to wait until this morning to actually use it! Every time I'm in the skin care aisle at the store, I always pause at the Olay display. Now I finally get to try it. So first things first - I am a sucker for packaging. I find the Olay packaging looks very 'mature' and premium (which is probably what they are going for, in which case they nailed it). The pump is easy to use, and dispenses the proper amount. Just a note that it took several (8-10) pumps to work the air out of the straw and for the product to come out. Don't give up! ) I always put my face cream on fresh out of the shower so it goes on easier and I use less. This cream was no different. At first I felt like it sat a bit heavier on my skin than I'm used to, but once it was fully absorbed that feeling went away. It makes my skin feel smooth, and has a pleasant smell - bonus! I don't have a super regular skin care routine, and I am blessed with young skin (in fact, I was just ID-ed buying cigarettes the other night. I'm 29!) so I'm not sure how many fine lines or wrinkles I have. However I am interested to see if it will help even my skin tone, enhance brightness and reduce the look of my pores (all claims on the box!) I took a 'before' picture prior to applying it for the first time this morning, and will apply it regularly for four weeks or until I run out of product, then take an 'after' photo. I will write a second review at that time with my thoughts! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Toal effects 7 in 1 is amazing! I really like this product! It's actually working for me...I've noticed a big difference in my fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes..they are barely visible now. My pores have also shrunk too.I would recommend this to people for sure. Thank you Buzzagent! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Results After 2 Days I started using OlayTotal Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Mousturizer as soon as I received it. In just 2 days my husband commented on my smooth skin on my cheeks and my teenage daughter said my cheek wrinkles weren't as noticeable. I noticed that my skin looked less tired and dull. After only using it for 2 days I can't wait to see what it looks like in 1 week of use. So far I have had positive results. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

Non sticky formula At first I try it in a little skeptical. Thinking it will be the same oily product that feels icky on the skin. I was totally wrong it was absorb by the skin the moment it dry out. It fells soft and not sticky at all. After 7 days of trial I seen less of age spots. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"best out there this is the best stuff. I like it so much I even ask for some for Christmas. I like how it feels and smells, it definitely has reduced my wrinkles especially my crows feet and the lines on my forehead as well. And it makes my face feel soft all day and night when with most creams that soft feeling goes away after a couple of hours. Will definitely keep using this everyday.

Might be OK for some. I did not like the way it felt on my skin. I felt like I had on some sort of a skin mask. It may be OK for some people. But not for me. The moisturizer does have a creamy texture to it.
Awesome product I love this moisturizer because it makes my skin feel so fresh and clean. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

My skin feels so good I love the feeling of my face after applying this cream. The cream makes my face feel soft and it also feels it has more elastic in it. I notice that after a week my lines seems to lessen and my completion is brighter and smoother. On many occasions I can now go without any foundation on because mt skin tone is much better now using this cream. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

Review Oil of Olay Its a very bice product only been using for a few days but it makes my skin feel very fresh amd radiant. I would recommend this product to anyone. It doesnt leave your skin with an oily residue and isnt heavy on the skin. I apply a pea size amount and it covers my entire face. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Awesome Make my skin looks perfect, i have a sensitive so is difficult for me to find a product who don't make any damage to my skin, and i find this. I try Olay before with a exfoliating cream i was good, so i take the risk with this and i just love it"
"Looking at a younger me! I think that using the Olay products for many years, my skin is younger and healthier looking than my sisters who dont use anything on their skin. I am the oldest and you would never guess by looking at me and my Olay skin! I have always loved the smell and it is one of very few products that dont make my face turn red from sensitivity. I loved Olay many years ago and I love Oay to this date. Great product!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"irreplacable! I've beeen faithful To Total Effects Daily Moisturizer since it first came on the market. I have tried other products, but I always return to Total Effects. My skin falls apart in a day without it. I can't live without it. I would need a whole line of another product to even come close to getting the results I get in one little bottle of Total Effects Daily Moisturizer. Consistently great results!"
this product is a wonderful moisturizer I have using oil of olay for over 45 years and I am 83 years old.Their products have only gotten better as the years go by. This moisturizer keeps my skin firm and hydrated as I use It at night-and every morning. I would never be without it. I recommend this wonderful moisturizer to anyone who wants to keep their skin looking and feeling great. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Pumping to Perfection The texture of this product is hard to explain- it incredibly light like a lotion and yet it penetrates my skin like a thick moisturizer. It was an effective weather block on a fall day. My skin immediately felt moisturized and revitalized. The pump ensured I dint get too much - my face used 3 pumps . After a few days (not weeks or months) I could see results and I expect the best results are still to come This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"I am so loving it! I have fallen in love with the Olay Total Effects! After two weeks of testing it, I see great results such as: skin testure and softness. In addition, I love how it feels light on skin and it is not strong in scent. When I first put on the Olay Total Effects on my skin, it gets absorbed right away without leaving any oiliness. Although it is light on skin, it is moisturizing enough for the winter. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Best Moisturizer - Olay 7 in 1 I think this is the best moisturizer around olaytotaleffect7in1 bzzagent tryforfree my personal experience is it easy to apply, non greasy, reduces fine lines and wrinkles especially around my eyes, by skin tone is refresh glowing and even tone, my skin feels firmer and my pores do not show especially on my nose where they were more prominent. Fantastic product - will now use on a regular basis!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"not enough words to explain! I have never tried this product before but I saw my mom using this when I was I kid, my impression with this is that it is too oily and greasy I might end up if not with an oily face or clog pores, but then I got one from my BzzAgent family as part of our promotional campaign. I was hesitant at first because the least part of my body that I would have experiment is my face, but then as one of my first projects I finally did try it. It wasn't what I expected it to be it's not oily and heavy, just light and I think it did even gave me a powder finish, my face isn't that oily as before. I waited for like a couple more weeks for maximum result, right now its been my third week and haven't got any zitz so far ( thank God!) so I guess it isn't really oily and it doesn't clog pore as contrary to my first belief. With the fine lines, I really can't tell that 'cause right now I believe with my age I don't have them yet ( thanks God again!). Skin tone Yea I guess it made my skin fairer and brighter. Age spots not really.. 'cause I don't have them yet just like with the fine lines but hey it did made my dark spot go away! really! so if you have pimple marks I suggest you use Olay religiously! And I also believe that it minimize the looks of my pores specially in my pore head and made my skin softer and radiantly fair! So I guess all in all it's worth your money though I know they're a bit pricey. Like I said before my mom is already using them when I was still a kid, to think that they've been in the business like forever so maybe this brand is really well trusted by many! :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love the mildness of this moisturizer As a person who suffers from major allergies, I was very relieved to find no kind of reaction to this scent free moisturizer. It definitely moisturizes and smooths fine lines and wrinkles, makes skin so soft, and evens skin tone. Requires very little product to smooth over face and neck. Feels very refreshing, and keeps skin moisturizer through out entire day! Love this product and will continue to use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer works in my skin! I have used Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I am 40 years old and I have received many compliments about my skin.

"Love the smell!! I would buy this based on scent alone!! I have very dry skin and it keeps me moisturized all day long and keeps my skin bright, especially around my eyes! I am 42 and have been experiencing age spots in the last few years and this is making them less noticeable! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So good that I bought the product I received this cream as a free sample. After a few days, I truley loved the cream. It left my skin feeling smooth with even skin tone. I think i would need to use the product a little longer to notice a difference in age spots and fine lines. The cream does leave an oily feeling on your skin. After sampling the cream, I did buy the product as I did like the feel of my skin after using the cream. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay 7 in 1 anti-aging cream I think this is a good product, my goal is that it really works on eliminate age spots. I like the smell and it is smooth, not greasy on hand or face compare to other anti-aging product. I need to buy a full size one to replace the one that I was using. Especially when I take it to work, my co-workers were trying it too, so it was almost gone before the end of the day. Anyways, thanks for the trial size...

An even looking skin tone... might need blush I typically use a thick hydration cream in the winter as my skin gets dry and an spf on top. I feel that this product could take the place of 3 products in my winter routine. I have some first signs of rosacea that I could see clearly before starting using this product but having used it for a few weeks has removed those signs and evened out my skin tone. I may have to start using blush! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Quite an effective product I actually tried this as a base on my skin, and then applying my makeup on top. It actually worked! Other moisturizers have been too greasy/oily to allow makeup to go on, but with this product, I'm able to have both a moisturizer and make-up at the same time! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Best Moisturizer on the market! After trying the vast majority of moisturizers on the market, Olay Total Effects is the clear winner! It is not oily and leaves your skin feeling refreshed! It reduces fine lines, age sports and wrinkles! There is no moisturizers that have worked in such little time This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Amazing Cream I think this cream is amazing I have tried many different creams and have not been very happy, but this cream goes on smooth and is not oily. I have been using it for about 5 days now and I have seen a difference in my skin especially around the eye area, I love this cream. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love the product I have been using the cream since I received, and as someone with senative skin I was skeptical. But, my fave has never looked so great.

"Tighter skin! I have been applying the Olay total effects anti-aging moisturizer for a full week now and can see the slight improvements in my skin! My fine lines are gone and my cheeks and forehead appear tighter and younger. I am definitely a fan! I was worried that a new moisturizer would make my sensitive skin greasy or break out in pimples, but I can happily say this has not happened! I am only left with a fresher appearance!

"As close to the fountain of youth as I've found! I admit, I was skeptical when I received the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and the promises they made but I was more tan pleasantly surprised after trying it for a few weeks. Now, I can't tell you exactly how many weeks it was but I can assure you it was a minimum of 2 weeks. Since I'd been approaching 40 I started to notice a change in my skin. The pores were larger, the firmness wasn't what it used to be and what I lovingly referred to as freckles were just ugly age spots. Now I used the Olay Total Effects in conjunction with a great facial cleansing machine (which allows whatever product you aaply to be absorbed more deeply into the skin) and I'm in LOVE. I will admit I don't look like I'm 25 but I have seen a real improvement, so much that I ended up buying another bottle so I can continue with the skin care. My pores are WAY smaller and therefore less noticeable. Those freckles aka age spots are almost nonexistent and while I can't say my skin is as firm as it was in my 20's there is more moisture in it therefore at the very least giving my skin the appearance of being softer and firmer. The moisturizer gives my fantastic moisture without making my face look and feel like an oil slick. I have a physically demanding job and when I used other moisturizers I would find my face looked like I'd slathered it in EVOO by the end of my shift. Not a good look. Now I have a dewy look and a wonderfully touchable face. If there are any doubters reading this I suggest you stop doubting and give it a try. I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do!

"I will use this everyday! I think that this is by far the best facial moisturizer that I have ever used and have already gone and purchased one for myself and my mother!. I love the fresh, clean scent as well as the way it leaves my skin feeling. The fine lines I was developing are already starting to decrease and I can feel the elasticity of my skin improving. I plan on using this product for a VERY long time. Thank you BzzAgent This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Smooth looking skin I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging moisturizer was bang on with their product. It came at the right time of year for me as my skin was very dry. The vitamins and antioxidants helped hydrate my skin to help with the age spots and really did minimize the appearance of my pores. My skin was uneven in colour which this product helped with evening out. The sample size I found was not big enough though. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay Total Effects I have been using Olay Total Effects for just about 3 weeks now and I love it. It goes on nice and smooth, not greasy and has a very pleasant scent to it. Within a couple of weeks I noticed the lines around my eyes not as visible but most of all I notice was how bright my face looked. The dark circles diminished under my eyes as well. I will definitely recommend this to all I talk to and continue to use it myself! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Looking youthful I liked the simplicity of use. It's all in one bottle so no remembering order to apply just get up and wash your face and then again before bed. It truly is that easy. And it helps to notice results quickly. I also liked that there is no oily or dry after effect just pure softness. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Love love this product!! I think that this product is perfect in every way. It doesn't have a strong overpowering fragrance to it and is not greasy. When being applied the cream layers on evenly and smoothly and is not gritty and leaves my skin feeling smooth and non-greasy. It really evened out my skin tone and just erased some of the imperfections in my skin. I will be going out to purchase the product and continue to use it.

Olay for Healthy Skin I really like this product!! I have been using Olay 7 Step Anti Aging Moisturizer for the past couple of weeks have noticed a more healthy radiant complexion.

Overall I give this product a 5/5 due to its affordability and quality. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay Total Effects 7 in One. I used to use classic Olay regularly, and really liked how it worked but have tried different brands out in the past few years to try something new. I was excited to try a new product from Olay as any experiences I had had in the past were positive! Here are the claims and what I thought after use: 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - while I don't have any deep wrinkles, I do have some fine lines around my mouth and eyes, that I felt were lessened/less noticeable after repeated use. 2. Evens skin tone appearance - I feel like I am having to use a little less concealer, so this must be working as well. Without any make up on, my skin does appear more uniform as well. 3. Enhances brightness - I do feel as if my skin has a nice healthy glow. 4. Minimizes the look of pores - I am not really sure, as not a concern of mine. 5. Visibly reduces age spots - Not something I am concerned with, so also cannot comment. 6. Restores firmness - My skin isn't really saggy, but it did have a nice look to it after use. 7. Replenishes moisture - Now THIS was my selling point! My skin really suffers in the winter time - with use of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1, my skin was VERY moisturized and didn't show any of the usual signs I tend to have like dry flaky skin! I did not notice any issues with break outs, even though this is a very moisturizing cream, but again, my skin tends to be dry in the winter. I really liked how easy lotion blended into my skin as well - no sticky feel or excess! All in all, I am very happy with the product and would HIGHLY recommend using it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Loving it! This product is amazing! I've been using this product for three weeks. I've noticed (and others) how the bags under my eyes have almost disappeared. I don't look like I haven't slept for a while. My skin is softer and there's a glow about it. (No I'm not pregnant). This is a really good product and the smell is really clean. There's isn't to much perfum. I would definitely recommend Total Effects Cream. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Fabulous! Love it! Olay Total Effects is nothing short of fabulous, no hoax here folks. Truly amazing, my face has a particular age spot that is now visibly gone..

"Alittle goes a long way! I've been using a lot of different moisturizes and night creams as the season goes from fall to winter. As winter has been nicer than normal but it still dries my skin out very badly.

It was so smooth and soft and best of all those little lines around my eyes seem to be going away! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Fountain of youth found This product is light and refreshing. It doesn't clog pores or feel greasy at all. The coverage is fantastic and very little needed to apply.

"Dry skin after chemotherapy. After ending chemotherapy my skin was extremely dry and nothing seemed to work. I started using the Olay Total Effects 7 fragrance free and just after one application i noticed a big difference on my skin appearance. My skin looks much better and healthy now. I found what I needed, Thanks!!!"
"Amazing Skin Transformation This stuff is amazing. I just turned 40 and get compliments about my skin when I am out in public. I been using this for only a month, but since then my skin texture was transformed. I use to have many dry patches, and dark spots. I'm very picky when it comes to skin care products. Olay is the only drugstore brand I find that actually works and is worth buying. I definitely recommend this moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Simply The Best! My sensitive skin reacted beautifully to this cream - I was excited by the results my skin looks hydrated, toned, age spots faded and under my eye looks tightened and less puffy.

The texture spreads easily on the face just add to your beauty routine night and day and you will see the fantastic results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Oh I really like this I wasnt sure if this was going to be the same old regular moisturizer they sell at any store but I really am surprised at how much I like it. I hate using creams of any kind becauae I cant stand the greasy, hot feeling and it did not happen with this Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 anti aging moisturizer. It smells wonderful.

Fresh clean scent and heavenly feel The lovely scent and silky feeling will encourage you to put this wonderful moisturizer all over your body. But just a little will cover your whole face and make you feel like you have had an amazing facial. The moisturizer quickly disappears into your skin leaving a silky soft feeling that lasts a long time. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"my new go-to moisturizer I was kind of skeptical when I first got this because I was thinking, I feel like I'm too young to be using anti-aging products. NOT ANYMORE. This stuff was amazing. It absorbs great and it doesn't leave a greasing feeling. I have combination skin and it's hard finding a moisturizer that doesn't make me look super oily. When I use it, my skin looks and feels a lot better. I definitely recommend this to anyone (even if you're 25) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
looking younger I think the olay 7 in 1 anti aging works very well and i did notice that some fine lines on my face had faded which is awesome. I think most olay products works well ive never had an issue. This product is easy to use and doesnt leave your face greasy it leaves it with a mild glow as i put it. I will be telling everyone to purchase this product or at least try it to see the difference it makes.Will be buying again forsure. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Luxurious. Love it! I absolutely loved the feeling of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer. It felt like cool, creamy velvet on my face and neck. I also used it on my hands. A co-worker also noticed the brightness in my face that came with my once a day usage. It really makes a noticable difference. It is quite an affordable luxury. Does not make your skin greasy. Definitely worth the money. You only use a small amount so it lasts a while. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Age spot is fading I think Olay Total Effects 7 I in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a really good product. It helps to reduce fine lines and uneven skin tone. The age spot on my cheek is lighter. That surprised me consider I spend a lot of time in the sun. This product is not heavily scented. I recommend this product. I like it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"This product helps aging skin. The deep hydration regenerist regenerating cream is extremely helpful for those of us over 60. I always had dry skin, and after menopause, it got drier. The cream seems to retain my skin's natural moisture making it feel soft, nongreasy, and velvety smooth for a lady over 65. Being outdoors a lot, this cream helps guard my skin from the sun.

Olay Total Effects 7 This is the fountain of youth! Goes on smooth and light and completely evens out skin tones and doesn't clog pores. I don't even need foundation anymore as the balance in tone and texture is covered by Olay Effects7! I find most creams or lotions that claim to smooth wrinkles and find lines are too heavy and greasy feeling but this product is light and smooth and natural feeling. This is a new beauty essential for me! Love it! This review was collected as part of a promotion.

I used this under my make up or alone and it made my face feel smoother, softer and not greasy. I loved the smell - I'm sensitive to scent but this was light and nice!

It seems to have evened out my complexion in just two weeks. Great product!"

"Why No Fragrance-free Formula Today is my first time using this product. Felt great going on immediately, felt moisturized without being too greasy. Although it smells great I would have loved to have this formula in a fragrance-free option, my skin tends to be a little sensitive to fragrances, but I will give a final review in a couple of weeks"
"This product truly moisturizes I have found that using Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream on a daily basis truly keeps my face smooth.

What Wrinkles I have to say I love how smooth the olay total effects is making the lines on the outside corner of my eyes and smoothing out my cheeks. Seems to have calmed the bit of redness I get. Plus it smells fresh and doesn't feel heavy on my face and neck. Going to be buying for sure...only negative is that the bottle was to small!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay does it again I think that Olay has indeed done it again! I always love using Olay products and this one does not disappoint! Before I started using it I wondered if it would be any different but the answer is yes! My skin feels so smooth and soft and is so light you feel like you don't have anything on at all. The trial size is great for fitting in the purse and I find it really takes away my fine lines. If you love Olay like I do, give this a try! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Hydration!! Not sure if Olay Total Effects made me look up to 10 yrs younger, but I definitely love the way my skin looks and feels Initially, due to my eczema, I was somewhat reluctant to try a new, unknown, unproven product on my face. My fears were quickly alleviated as my eczema did not flare up. Olay left my face feeling hydrated, which is an amazing feat - considering the bone chilling temperatures we have had lately. Awesome product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Leaves my skin soft So this is Day 1 of using Olay Total Effects. It goes on nice and easy and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. I have large pores on my face that I am truly hoping that this will help dimensh the sight and leave my skin firmer. After using it the first time it has left my face feeling nice and soft and has a pleasant aroma. So far I am quite pleased with the product but will do another review after using it for awhile to see the difference. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Non greasy!! Whenever I have tried products like these, my complaint is always that the product is too greasy. But this wasn't greasy at all! I can't tell you how happy I was that it wasn't greasy. I would buy it this! My only complaint is that the pump dispensing the product is so thin, that it gets clogged up after every use. So everytime I use the product, the nozzle is plugged, hence product is being wasted. Other than that, I love this product This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"WOULDN'T BE WITHOUT REGENERIST!! I have been using Regenerist products since day 1...I am 65 years old and continuously get surprised comments and compliments on my skin and how young I look.

I am not one to use a moisturizer but I started using bare minerals makeup and didn't really like the moisturizer that came with the kit. I chose this one and fell in love. Since I have been using this product I rarely even wear any foundation because my skin is so clear and young looking. I love love love it!! Makes my face feel soft, clean and not heavy!!"
"Great Anti-Aging Properties! I've been using the Total Effects line for almost a week now, and it's been the first moisturizer in a long time that will be a repeat purchase for me.

"can i have some more I love the feel of this cream.The texture is luxuriously smooth and velvety. the scent was light and fresh. I have fairly sensitive skin and found that although this is a thick moisturizer, i didnt break out from it. My skin always felt super soft and hydrated after use. i dont have too many wrinkles or age spots, so i cant attest to those properties. But i did feel like it made my skin glow, which i love. Can i get another sample :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Beautiful Skin Cream I think that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is just the skin cream I was needing. As I age I found my skin changing.

Loving Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer! I have never tried an anti-aging moisturizer before so I was nervous that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer would be heavy and greasy but it is definitely not. This lotion is light but hydrating enough for Alberta winters. I don't have deep wrinkles but I have noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes. It also seems to give my skin a glow without adding shine. This product is everything it claims to be an more. I am hooked! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great Excellent product !! highly recommend it. I used it for 2 weeks and I saw results immediately
"Wonderful! I've been using this for about a week now and I wasn't sure if I'd see results, but I have! My skin is softer, it looks smooth and bright. It's also not so red all the time! Definitely a must have on my list! A little bit goes a very long way. I usually just used body moisturizers but this would be worth the cost because I only apply once after I wash my face, not multiple times per day. There's a very light scent, but it doesn't bother my sensitive nose. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Liked it. This product is amazing. Me and my family use it everyday.
Radiant skin I have been delighted to have received Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer!

"Olay total effects review I love this Olay total moisturizer I got to try. It actually did tame down a line that just started forming on my forehead. I'm still using the sample I received, so just the trail size goes a long way as I've been using it for a few weeks now. It doesn't leave a greasy after feeling and doesn't smell bad. I recommended it to my mother and she will try it out as well. I'm hoping to get the face wash and other products from the total effects line. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Light Moisturizer - Nice scent! Ive been using this sampler for a few weeks now and am impressed with is as a daily moisturizer. My skin definitely looks brighter, not the usual dry-ashy look that comes with Canadian Winters. I havent noticed a difference in lines, pores, spots etc but as a daily moisturizer I think this is great! Its light enough that it doesnt feel greasy but works well enough to calm dry skin. Ill definitely be sticking with this one! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Rachael- Olay Anti Aging moisturizer I loved this product so much that I asked my teens for more for Christmas. Super light and easily absorbed into my skin and easy to keep beside the bed for daily application. I can see a difference in my traditionally dry spots and my age freckles are less obvious than they were. I'm converted. My only comment is there is a slight smell which I find pleasant but someone with a scent sensitivity might need to try the fragrance free version. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Anti-Aging Moisturizer Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is an excellent skin product. My skin looks absolutely amazing after using this product.

"wish I tried it sooner love,love ,live this product. I've never used any Olay products and I'm glad I did. my skin looks like it's glowing! the texture and uneven skin tone has diminished drastically. I'm blown away with the product. it goes on so smoothly and absorbs quickly. the scent wasn't over powering like some moisturizers I've tried. I'm pretty sure I have about one pump left which is sad but I'll definitely be going to purchase more. I can't wait to see the long term affects! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Cleanest smelling moisturizer ever. This product is the best on the market. After you apply it your skin absorbs it almost immediately and the effects after it has soaked in are amazing. I would recommend this product highly to females as well as males. They do have the unscented form of this product for the men. Please do not ever stop making this product.
Awesome I love this product! It's so smoothing and my face felt better afterward.
Great product I love this product. I use it under my foundation or sometimes alone to moisturize. The overall effects are amazing. Within the first few days I noticed a change in the appearance of my skin. Within a few weeks the small lines seem to disappear. This product is not to oily for my combination skin. It leaves my face and neck area very smooth. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I love this stuff So I'm not one to try many different moisturizers as I find my skin is very picky and prone to breakouts when I switch around. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer though has not made that struggle real. My face reacted well and feels and looks amazing. I use it morning and night and have noticed a visible difference in both. I'm excited for this product to reach the store shelves in February so I can continue on with my routine. Good job Olay!

"Olay Total Effects totally moisturizes! Since the winter weather hit, my skin has been extra dry. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has helped keep this dryness to a minimum. It goes on smoothly, and I can feel my skin drinking it up! It leaves my skin softer and I like the light scent it has. I find my makeup goes on smoothly on top of it as well, which is a definite plus. I'm not sure if it makes my skin look younger, but I probably haven't been using it long enough to really see the results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Olay 7 in 1 I think Olay 7 in 1 anti- aging moisturizer is one of the best for trouble skin. It helps you feel replenished and helps your skin feel soft and fantastic all day. It has the effect of several different creams all in one. It has helped with my rosacea, and has helped with outbreaks on my skin. In my opinion it is a god send, and Im not so self conscious to show off my skin in public. If you haven't tried it already, go and get yours today because it is fantastic!

Smoother skin I'm usually hesitant to try new skin products as I have sensitive skin and most products irritate me.I was quite surprised on how light and smoothly Olay Total Effects went on and how I didn't have a reaction.

"How old am i It effectively reduces the appearance of pores, wrinkles and age spots. The effects of damage is also reduced. It leaves the skin hydrated, firmer, healthy, radiant, even and smooth. People also tell me that I have a radiant skin since I use Olay total effects. The only downside is the fragrance too strong. I would opt instead for the odorless version.

"Love this Product This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft, smooth and non-greasy. I like the dispenser as it puts the lotion in my palm without contaminating the unused product by touching it with my fingers. Have found that I do not need a full pump of the product because that is way too much for covering my face and neck. Anyone who has dry skin should not hesitate to give this a try."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, Ive been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for 20 days straight and I am a ex smoker so I have wrinkles by my eyes and rough skin and this worked I see a difference my skin tone is looking so good.

"Great for Canadian winter I live in Toronto, and my skin gets quite rough this time of year. For about 10 days I have been using Player Total Effects 7 as my morning moisturizer, and my skins feels great, especially when it comes to fine lines on my forehead and uneven tone.

I will be using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 from now on. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Will add Olay Total Effects to my skin care plan I have been using Olay Total Effects for a couple of weeks now. At first I found the fragrance a little strong but it no longer bothers me. I like that the cream is not heavy and my skin does appear to glow. We had a weeks worth of dry cold weather and it moisturized my skin well. The bottle dispenses the cream easily. I definitely will be buying this cream when I finish my bottle. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"I'm a believer I've actually been using Oil of Olay Total Effects for a couple months now, so when the opportunity came about to buzz about it I jumped on it. Being a well recognized brand many think that Oil of Olay is for grandmas. Think sunday night cold cream masks. Not so! Total Effects soaks into the skin cleanly leaving it fresh without that heavy feeling. My skin has improved around my eyes and forehead. Being available everywhere and reasonably priced is just a perk for what i believe is a great product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Awesome Olay! I positively loved this lotion. I only have a few fine lines and slight uneven skin tone, but the results I achieved were incredible. The lines are nearly invisible and my skin has never felt or looked more incredible. My skin is smooth and completely clear. I also have sensitive skin, however this product did not aggravate my skin for one moment. I love this lotion and will definitely use it in the future. If anyone is hesitant to try it they should have absolutely no reservations whatsoever. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Amazing cream I really like using this cream not only does it help with wrinkles and dark spots but it helps with everything. Its a 7 in one and I really like that I don't have to go buy different products for different effects it does it all. I like that it has antiaging and helps with uneven skin tone. I am really loving using this product that I have even gone as far as getting rid of all my single bottle stuff and using just olay total effects saves me money and I only need one bottle love it.

I am only 19 but just within the last 4 days of using this product in the mornings and evenings I can tell a difference.My mom had asked if I had foundation on today, when I didn't! It helped lighten some of the red spots on my skin, and it is not oily. I went and bought the body wash and foaming face wash today that go with this line! Will be leaving reviews about those also!"
Very Pleased with the Look and Feel of my Skin During lunch how I keep my skin looking so clear and (relatively) wrinkle-free. I let them know that Ive been using Olay total Effects for about a month now and they were very surprised to see that such amazing results came from Olay. They were expecting me to say that I was using a much more expensive product from a specialty or department store. I love that this product fights 7 effects of aging. It definitely works as advertised and I will be using this again and again! This review was collected as part of a promotion.

First of all its not a sticky moisturizer. My skin does NOT feel gross and clammy after applying. It feels soft and smooth. After 4 days of use my skin is more firm. Its brighter. Less Redness, less bumps and overall looks clear and smooth. I cannot believe the results. I have tried MANY products but this out moisturizes them all ! I am in love !!

Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 While I didn't find that it did anything for my fine lines I do still love this product. My skin is crazy and reacts to the simplist of products but I've always been able to use Olay products without a reaction or worry of a break out. This cream goes on smoothly and without needing a big amount either so it will last longer than other cream containers. It did solve my dry skin problem and left it feeling soft and silky. It is a product I will definitely be using again and recommending. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

Simply amazing! I received a free trial size through BzzAgent thanks to lovely people at OLAY! I have an acne prone and uneven skin tone that puts me in a really hard stop when shopping for skin care products. I would like to begin my review saying WOW! as this product works really good on my skin. No break outs nor oiliness. 1. Visibly smooths fine lines and wrinkles - I could see a slight improvement of my crows feet around my mouth as I really don't have noticeable wrinkles anywhere else on my face. 2. Evens skin tone appearance - Of course it does! I have been using this for almost 3 weeks now and I can see significant improvement on my forehead and around cheeks. 3. Enhances brightness - This hydrates the skin and keep it fresh all day long nourishing the skin with antioxidants. Due to that fact my skin tones has improved its brightness. 4. Minimizes the look of pores - I have open pores on my cheeks and thanks to Olay total effects 7X moisturizer my pores look smaller and controls the oiliness of it and which is something that I really like about this product. 5. Visibly reduces age spots - I really don't have many age stops excepts two or three very small ones and so far I could see they have been faded a little bit. 6. Restores firmness - My skin feel fresh and soft once I applied this product and usually my skin is firmed and after start using this my skin became even firmer. 7. Replenishes moisture - It does a really good job at replenishing moisture and make your skin look hydrates all day long! I would suggest this product to anyone who wants to get rid of uneven skin tone and add brightness to their skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
My favourite gift was Olay. Olay has been a good product for me. I love the way it radiates my skin immediately after use. I like the slight sheen which is not too slick or greasy. It absorbs into my skin almost straight away after application. I love the feel of it. The fact that it is fragrance free means no rashes for me. Yippee!! Top marks for Olay. Needless to say I love the product and have recommended to my friends who have gone out to purchase it. Thank you for the opportunity to let me try it.

Feels good on skin Products are good on dry skin. I like the lotions and would love to get more of these products.
Thanks Olay for giving me the chance to try this great product. I like the the pump style bottle it comes in. Olay has very light and pleasant scent !! The texture of the cream is silky smooth and is not to watery or to heavy on the skin at all. This cream absorbs nicely and gives your skin a smooth hydrated feeling. After using the Olay total effects for a while I have noticed pretty good results! My skin tone looks healthier and my fine lines seem a bit smoother.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Antu-Aging Moisturizer I think this moisturizer is amazing! I have been using this Olay product for almost six weeks and I love it. I am 44 years old and I have pretty dry skin especially in the winter and I am impressed with how hydrated and smooth my skin feels. This moisturizer feels light on my face, the scent is not overpowering and the pump delivers the perfect amount. My skin tone looks even and my laugh lines seem to be less defined.

"Loving It!!! Gone, my fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone are quickly disappearing. I have noticed a visible difference in my skins appearance since starting with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer.

"Beautiful Product I'm in my 40s, and have had my fair share of skin problems such as extremes in dry and oily conditions, as well as cystic acne requiring aggressive prescription treatment. I have tried many products from drugstores to direct sales, to medispas and still haven't found my go-to moisturizer. Or perhaps I have... I am a bit of a cynic when it comes to companies that promote products that 'erase' years from your skin in a short amount of time. Like I say, I've tried just about everything and paid handsomely for it. However, the opportunity to try Olay's Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for free was too good to sneer at so I was grateful to participate in this campaign. The box arrived with this adorable little bottle of moisturizer and I wasn't so sure that it would last 4 weeks. I realized after a few uses that only a small amount is needed (half a pump) and it glides on very smooth. I've been using it fairly regularly (once a day) for a few weeks and I'm already loving these features: - As with all Olay products, it smells wonderful. - Applies evenly and covers a my face and neck with a small amount - Does not feel greasy or sticky - Does not contribute to oil slicks later in the day - Does not 'burn' freshly washed blemishes - Makes a nice primer for makeup - Leaves my face baby bum soft!! - Give a really nice glow, evened out my skin tone It might be a bit early to say that it has reduced my fine lines and wrinkles, because one good belly laugh and there they are again!

Great product I am really happy with this product. It not only rejuvenates your dry skin it also brightens and made my pores look a lot smaller. Evened out my skin tone as I am normally quite red in the t-zone. I would want to know before buying this product the price and the quality of ingredients used. I can tell that the product is good quality because how my skin feels after I use it . I normally don't use anything on my face before trying this out but now I reach for it after my shower and before bed. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"visible results from an amazing product I am using Olay Yotal Effects for 3 weeks now and i can totally see the difference i use it daily , day and night . I observed that my facial pores close , my skin tone is getting even, fine lines are not noticeable anymore as i have it under my eyes , my skin lighter , rosy , soft and glowing,I feel like 10 years younger, check out my before and after pics and see the difference . I wear it daily day and night and it works magic as a moisturizer, it provides moisture and glow all day and protects your skin from outside elements like dirt, smoke and dust , it works like a barrier on my skin and a great base over a foundation or powder or even without anything on..One day i forgot to apply and i felt itchy because of the weather here, so i went to buy another bottle and put in my purse just in case i forget and it is affordable compared to my previous moisturizer .Getting compliments from friends and hubby is another thing , well now that I look young i also feel young , I shared my experience and they are excited to try it , atleast they said it is proven because they saw my transformation. Love the effects on my face non greasy, very light on the skin , it has mild fresh scent , and you can wear it all day without looking oily because it absorbs fast , It has a mild feeling but potent effect on the skin.I will surely have a merry and glowing Christmas . I told my family all i want for my Chistmas stocking is Olay so i am sure I will ne a happy lady this christmas , can't wait . This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great Product Waited until I used this product for a long enough period of time before completing this review. I wanted to ensure I was able to give this product the great review that it well deserved. It works very well near my eyes where I have the most issues. I'd recommend this product for anyone conceted with the effects of aging. Gives your skin a glow you will be very impressed with. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
It really works! When I was chosen to try this new face lotion I was extremely happy! After using it now for one week my skin is noticeably smoother and brighter in appearance. I really like the non greasy formula and love how it comes in a new smaller bottle which will be ideal when I travel now. I would recommend this wrinkle cream to anyone and I can't wait to see the results in a few more weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Reduce, Reverse and Rejuvenate We are bombarded with products that claim to fight one thing or another when it comes to skin care. While I have used many different products, none have matched the quick (and I mean quick) results that I have seen with Olay's Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It's a moisturizer that can work day or night with a nutrient formula needed for skin. I used it mainly as a night moisturizer but it can be worn all day. The product smell is gentle and pleasant so it's not a medicated smell or overpowering. The applicator pump itself gives you just enough product you need which I think is a great way to control any possible adverse effects like breakouts with overusing the product . For someone with sensitive skin like myself, this is a HUGE help that takes away the guess work. While trying this product, I did not get one breakout so that's been a huge bonus for me. For the results, while I did not wrinkles to actually notice any difference I did see quite a remarkable difference in my skin specially with dark spots and skin tone. I have been an avid user of the Clinique Dark Spot Corrector which I cannot use for prolonged periods of time because of breakouts. But the Olay Total Effects have worked much better in shorter period of time and I see a HUGE difference in the way my skin looks and feels. With the added bonus of affordability this is definitely being added to my regular routine!! I definitely recommend to anyone who wants to get better results without the huge price tags.

"I'm amazed It has been just over a month since I started using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and the results are shocking to me. The lines around my eyes are quite faded and smoothed out. I even see major changes in the deep lines by my mouth and on my forehead. I went into this fully expecting not to see any results, I felt I was too young for it but I am AMAZED! My skin feels tighter and younger. This will be my new moisturizer from now on!! Olay you have changed my mind! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Soft, Supple and Bright I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is one of the best moisturizers i've ever used. I will definitely be switching from my regular Moisturizer to this one! I received a free sample trial size of the regular scent, but will be purchasing the unscented version for regular use. This Moisturizer goes on smooth, without leaving a sticky tacky feeling. My face feels incredibly soft and smooth. Fine lines have been greatly diminished, and skin tone evened out. Very impressed!gotitfree OlayUs This review was collected as part of a promotion."
the product smells amazing The product sort kf smells like vanilla strawberries
Quenching Relief for My Face The sample I was provided as a BzzAgent had a slight fragrance which worried me at first as I'm sensitive to fragrances. I had no issues at all with the fragrance. I'm very impressed that the Olay Total Effects 7 in 2 Anti-aging Moisturizer has been keeping my face very soft and refreshed. My skin tone does seem to be balancing as well the more I use it. Exciting news trial size will be available in stores starting in February so you can try this wonderful product without having to buy a full size bottle.

"Best Purchase Ever I first became a user of Olay products in 2008. I work outside, without a hat and had noticed that my skin was becoming dry, scaly, with patchy brown spots. I first tried the Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum and really noticed a difference right a away. I knew it was working when my co-workers wanted to know what I had done. I then returned to Walmart and began to look at Olays other products and purchased the Olay Total Effects. I am very happy with both products and will continue to use. Thank You."
"Best cream ever! If any of you have noticed my skin, its really bad. I was able to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for free from BzzAgent. It has made such a difference. I have no more redness, dryness or blemishes. I also have skin that looks really great! I would recommend this product hands down over anything else Ih ave ever used. This included expensive department store creams. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Because I am all about that face,about that face!! Olay 7 promised these things... Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles -Evens skin tone appearance -Enhances brightness -Minimizes the look of pores -Visibly reduces age spots -Restores firmness -Replenishes moisture What I think .. *I feel that this product is smooth and not harsh on your skin,It makes your skin look bright but not greasy like most products do.While putting it on I felt a birst of moisture on my face while putting it on.Even thought its the first day/night my face feels younger all ready :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Moisture Plus! The more I use it the more I like it. The more I think about it , the more I think my skin is improving. The only problem I'm running out! My skin is brighter and has less redness. My skin is smoother. I don't wear concealer or foundation so this is especially important for me. Olay 7 in 1 is non oily and absorbs quickly. It smells great and has fragrance free options. For someone who had an albeit uneducated negative view of Olay prior to this, I'm seriously impressed. Oh and I love the dispenser too!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Beautifully olay! This is a great moisturizing product from Olay! I love how it is not too greasy and it really penetrates into the skin when you put it on. It's a fragrance free product which is so important for facial products. This is my favorite Olay Moisturizer! The vitamins and antioxidants really help to hydrate and reduce the look of age spots, minimize the appearance of pores, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. I tried other anti-aging moisturizers but Olay has come through as the winner! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
younger skin sounds good to me!!! Im always skeptical of claims made by skin care companies. I have a background in esthetics so i always like to see results for myself. Im very pleased so far. My first initial use was after i exfoliated my skin and i noticed how smooth it felt. I like the texture if the cream and it didnt leave any feeling of greasiness behind. I recently tried to go to work without makeup to see if i would see a difference. I did feel that my skin tone was more even and my skin felt softer. So far it's a thumbs up!!!

"I wish there was a sample after the sample I am thoroughly enjoying my sample of Olay 7 in 1 total effects moisturizer BzzAgent!! So much that I wish there was more of it to follow. I am a long time user of Olay products and find this to be fantastic! It's lite, fast absorbing, very soft scented and not greasy or heavy. I have noticed my skin brightened and even toned. I don't look 36 to begin with (maybe this is thanks to Olay over the years lol ) but I have noticed a difference in the overall appearance of my skin. Thanks Olay and BzzAgent!!!!

"I'm digging it Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is supposed to : Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles Evens skin tone appearance Enhances brightness Minimizes the look of pores Visibly reduces age spots Restores firmness Replenishes moisture In 7 days, I noticed 5 of the 7! That's incredible. I'm loving it, and will be continuing to use it after I run out of the sample. In a week, coworkers are mentioning that my face looks brighter also, so i's not just my wishing that I see some of these! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This product feels good I have tried a few different brands over the years but I keep coming back to the Total Effects. It doesn't feel heavy or greasy and when used consistently it works great on dryness and fine wrinkles.Some people have said hat you have to switch moisturizers for different times of the year summer/winter but not when you use Total Effects I like how it feels and what it does all year long.

Love this product! My skin looks and feels younger and definitely is more hydrated after each use. I just turned 50 years young and I get compliments on how young I look all the time. Thank you Olay for such a great product line. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Oil of Olay Total Effects I LOVE this product!!! I have been using the 7 in 1 once daily at bedtime. I am amazed that in the short time I have been using it that I can see the change in my skin! My skin is incredibly soft and smooth!! The biggest change, which I was sceptical about the claim, is the noticeable reduction in aging spots on my forehead. In the last number of years the spots have been increasing and I did not know what to do about it. Well, this product is it!!! I will definitely continue to use this product!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Excellent Moisturizer! I can't believe how bright my skin looks, it has made my skin so much more healthy-looking! It's not too greasy, very light with a light scent, but still makes my skin feel moisturized and protected from the elements. I have been developing forehead wrinkles the past few years, and Olay Total Effects 7 in one Anti-Aging Moisturizer seems to make them less visible. I am happy with this product!

"moisturizing lotion The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a hit. I found this moisturizer light which is important for daytime use.

"No Greasy Feeling! Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is amazing!! It moisturizes my dry winter skin without clogging pores! Feels light weight and no greasy feeling afterward! I was worried when I started using this that I would end up with either a breakout, or a rash. I have very sensitive skin and because it has a great smell I was worried about the scent and how it would affect my skin. But it wasn't harsh at all! No rash, no breakout and my skin feels softer, smoother and looks younger! A++ This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Olay Total Effects I just love, love, love this product. In just a few days I noticed the fine lines around my eyes were deminished and my skin was much softer, if this is the results in just a few days, I can only imagine what my skin will look like after 4 weeks.

"Just love Olay Total Effects Since starting this campaign, I'm just loving OlayTotal Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It's made my skin feel so soft and look great. I've noticed that the fine lines around my eyes are starting to disappear and that age spots are getting lighter. I was worried that when I started to use it, my skin would feel sticky because of the product. It doesn't. It goes on smooth. I thought that the smell would be harsh.... it isn't. It's very pleasant. All in all I've been very impressed by how well it's working. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"I can't do without this product I have been using the Regenerist Micro Sculpting cream for about 4-5 years now. It has kept my skin looking younger, firmer and seems to keep my minor wrinkles from worsening, and with no break-outs at all.. I use it before bed every night. I apply on my neck and work my way up. I'm hooked and will never switch my moisturizer. After all, I have been using Oil of Olay since I was 19 years old. Its a keeper. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loving this product I am usually very hesitant to try a new moisturizer as I have sensitive skin. The first thing I noticed was that it didn't have a strong chemical smell like some other anti-aging moisturizers I've seen. I used this product everyday until I ran out. It has a very light scent, you don't need a lot of product and it doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy. It moisturized my skin very well and I did notice that some of my fine lines were less noticeable. Overall I was very happy with this product and would purchase it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"After time, a definite improvement in skin tone! When I first tried this, I noticed it was a nice moisturizer overall. I like the finish, I like that its lightweight, and I like that it keeps my skin moisturized all day. Initially, I had satisfactory results as far as an improvement in overall tone went. I must say, with time I have definitely noticed a difference. My opinion of the product has definitely improved with my skin. This is a really great product, especially if, like myself, you are switching from products for younger skin to anti aging products. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

This product truly lives up to its name. What more could I say This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great product! I've had a problem all my life with dark spots and uneven skin tone . With this product Ive also noticed how it worked so well with the dark spots . It's a lot lighter than it was and I don't need to apply as much concealer to cover them up! I've also noticed my skin near my eyes and the side of my lips are slightly firmer which I'm impressed with because of how quickly I noticed the results . Great product and I have purchased the full size product to test out and see how much more difference it would make This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Little bottle of heaven!! I have a really hard time finding a face moisturizer that isn't too greasy for my face! It smells great which is another huge bonus for me! I can already tell that it's evening my skin tone and restoring firmness to my face!!! I'm sure as the days go on I'l notice the other the other benefits that are listed! Which makes me excited to wash my face and watch everything I have wanted from a anti-aging moisturizer!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Fantastic Product! I am in my 40's and blessed with a young look, except for some wrinkles that are starting to form. Olay to the rescue! After a few weeks of using the product, my skin has evened out in tone and my wrinkles have diminished! The product includes SPF 15, so I never have to worry about forgetting my sunscreen. It goes on smoothly, and the pump on the container delivers just the right amount of product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
I cry when I'm out of it! Olay Total Effects makes me look 10 years younger! I don't want to face a day without it. A young top supermodel (in the hospital) once told me she cries too without it! I shared some of mine.
"This isn't your mother's moisturizer! The only experience I had with Olay before this campaign was thay it was the moisturizer my mother used daily while I was growing up. I'm 36, not far off her age back then, but I still had it stuck on my head that it was not quite for me yet. I was so very wrong. First off, that tiny tube has lasted me for well over a month, one pump per day was all that was necessary. It comes out easily, is very light and has a really nice gentle smell. Not at all what I expected. I'm lucky enough to not really have any wrinkles, but I have noticed my complexion is balanced (I have combo skin), not too greasy, but not tight and dry which I've alway had a hard time maintaining with other products. I also noticed a huge reduction in how noticeable pores were, especially on my nose, as well as how just generally bright and glowy my skin looks. I absolutely love the small size, I travel a lot and it's perfect. I'm actually leaving for two weeks in a few days and I'm sad to say I think it's not gonna make it that long. I'll have to pick up a larger one for now. I will get the one with sunscreen though, that was really the only thing that would have made this better. All in all, this is a great inexpensive moisturizer that really produced genuine noticeable results. I would (and have) recommend it to a friend in a second and it compares very will to some more expensive ones I have used. It's most definitely not only my mom's moisturizer any more!

"Healthier natural-looking skin I have been using this product for only two weeks now. The results are amazing: visibly removes lines and wrinkles, leaving a healthy natural-looking skin. My friends told me I look as if I have come back from vacation in the sun because this product enhances your natural skin tone. It leaves a non-greasy feeling and smells good too. My dark spots have diminished and my old skin looks younger. I have been using Olay products for many years now and this one is by far the best yet. Cannot wait for it to come out in stores so me and my friends can buy it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Skin is glowing I love it It works amazing I love it made my skin so smooth and so soft I def recommend ! Love love it
"Must have skin care product Olay is my brand when it comes to skin care. I am very particular about my skin, especially face. I started using this product when I entered my late twenties. I didn't even bother to look for other brands. It's been over five years and I'm still using this product. I do get complements that I don't look my age. Do I need to say more Go ahead ladies and get this product if you love your skin. Another plus is that it comes with a smooth and comfortable packing. Basically I am in love with this product and hope they'll never stop making it ! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"First day of the trial! I received my sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and starting using it about 1 1/2 weeks ago. I've decided to do a weekly pic, but had internet issues wasn't able to post until now! This pic is the first day I received Olay Total Effects. My first impression was that the dispenser dispenses a little bit too much when you compress it fully, but thats not a big deal ) While applying Olay Total Effects to my skin, I noticed it absorbed quickly and was fairly non-greasy. I liked that it does not have a strong perfume to it also. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects works even in Edmonton I was in Edmonton recently for a work trip. This city is cold and known for being very dry. Everyone complains about how dry and cracked their skin is here. My co-worker was there the week before me and said how dry her skin got while there. I got my sample of Olay Total Effects just before I left and figured this would be a good test. It seemed rather light and I was wondering if it was up to the task. The picture I've attached is at the end of the week - and I didn't look or feel dry on my face at all! It worked, and it felt so great on, so light. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Amazing product! This product did everything and more then it promised. First of all I have very sensitive skin and I did not break out at all from it. A little goes a long way. I would use it at night and just overnight this product showed visible results. My skin felt younger, and stronger in one use. My skin is usually dry and I get spots from it, but after using this product for four weeks all of that has disappeared. My skin looks youthful, firm and fresh. The dark spots have faded and I feel younger. I will recommend this to my friends and family for sure! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects I received this product as a Bzz Agent and have been using it now for several weeks. Before I tried Olay Total Effects I was curious if it could live up to its claim of making someone look 10 years younger. I also wondered if it would be too heavy on my face and clog my pores. While I can't claim to look 10 years younger, I have definitely noticed a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes. The lotion is light and absorbs quickly, and lasts a long time. I only have to apply this lotion once a day to keep moisturized. Overall, an excellent product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay total effects This product did amazing. I use to be told how nice my skin use to be and lately I haven't heard it anymore and I have noticed why. I tried out the product and I was amazed by the outcome. My skin didn't have any flaws after a few days of using it. Over the christmas holidays I got my complements back which made me feel amazing. With 2 kids and a newborn I don't have much time or the energy to keep my complextion at its best every day. This product makes it easy and only a few minutes to apply. I love this stuff I will recommend it to everyone. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Great Product! I was surprised how much I like this cream! My skin is very sensitive and I'm limited to certain products. I've had no allergic reaction to this and my skin feels great. It moisturizes well and my skin does not feel greasy at all, especially at the end of the day. The trial size was pretty small but that's fine. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and still have lots left. The key is not to use too much at once. I am definitely planning on buying this in the future. I would highly recommend it. I think it will be worth the price to pay for it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"A YOUNG 41 I waited a while before writing a review on the Olay total effects 7 in 1 moisturizer mostly because I wanted to see if it worked. I'm a young looking 41. No wrinkles or fine lines yet really, but I am starting to see that my skin is not as tight as it used to be. I can't say this is a miracle worker, but I have noticed less uneven skin tone, and slightly tighter skin, especially around my neck. I'm sure if I keep this up, it will help in the long run. I like that it's not too greasy or heavy and that it soaks in quickly. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I am a big fan of Olay skincare product. Before I got the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer free to try from Bzzagent, my everyday skincare is Olay Age Defying series. For my age, I don't have the big problem about fine lines, wrinkles, and firmness, but afterI have tried Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for almost a month now, the biggest change for me is it evens my skin tone and enhances the brightness. That makes me more younger look! It would be my new favorite skincare product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Tiny bottle with HUGE results! I recently tested the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Agining Moisturizer and find my skin has had such a huge transformation! I find that my skin tone is more even around the rougher areas of my face, which is only after a weeks use. I found that it doubles as a moisturizer 100 and was able to cut back on my daily moisturizing routine as this was enough! The texture was very thin and unnoticeable on my face and was even able to wear it on it's own without any foundation! The coverage was amazing and my face feels more vibrant!

"Does what it Promises! Yup, does what it promises. I used Olay Total Effects for a week, and my skin was noticeably softer, smoother, with fewer lines and lessened wrinkles! To be truthful, aging isn't something I'm terribly worried about showing- but I loved how soft, smooth and moisturized my skin felt with using this product everyday! I love it, I recommend it. It's just that good. Thank you Bzz for letting me try Olay Total Effects. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Lasted all night I have fairly oily skin, so I get nervous about putting anything too creamy or moisturizing on my skin, because by the end of the night I'll look like an oil slick. However, this wasn't too heavy! It went on light but provided a bit of 'coverage' and left me looking 'radiant' all night! I didn't have to blot my face more than usual and I had a nice glow to my skin. I went to a Christmas party and it held up beautifully! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Works Well I love this product, it moisturizes while minimizing pores, evens out my skin tone, reduces wrinkles and lines and has SPF - what more do you need! From the cute packaging and the pump which dispenses the perfect amount. The consistency of the cream is smooth and applies easily not greasy and gave my face a nice healthy glow. Would highly recommend this product and I will definitely being buying this cream again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love This! I love this moisturizer, it has a nice thickness to it so you feel like it's working and hiding those fine lines. I feel 100 confident it's doing all it needs to do within a moisturizer. I also like that it has a light scent - nothing over powering and you're not smelling it all day. I've used some higher end moisturizers that cost a lot more than Olay Total Effects products but this by far is better than those. You can notice a difference almost instantly.

"Already seeing results I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 trial size since I received it in the mail about a week and a half ago. Within days I have seen a difference. My pores are noticeable different, the skin on my upper cheeks is tighter and I can notice an evening in my skin tone. I've been using a competing brand that advertises 'even skintone' for years and have not seen results like this. I will absolutely be buying this product...and I really like the smell.

"Clean and bright I tried it and think it was nice. It make you face feel fresh, clean. What i liked about that product, no oil on your face, you got a dry face. About the pores i havent seen a lot of changes i do t have lots of pores but it didnt change. Maybe if i would use it for 4 week( cause i didnt got some for 4 weeks) i would finda change and tons more too say but like every olays product, they're great! Thanks olay to give us the chance of trying your product!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Oil of olay Wouldn't use anything else . I have tried other products, but have not been satisfied."
Olay Total Effects I just tried this Olay total effects moisturizer and I love it. It comes in a pump bottle and pumps out so nice. Love the way my skin feels after applying this. I have been using olay products for a long time but never tried this one and I may have just found a new favorite. . I just started using it so I can't comment yet on fighting the signs of aging or the helping with uneven skin tone. So stay tuned on that. I would easily recommend this product to anyone.

"Happy to see that young face again! Love this Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer from Olay! I've replaced my daily moisturizer with this one. My skin looks and feels great! My skin glows all day long and I have not had a dry flake on my face (in winter!) since I've tried it! I know what you're thinking... nope, it's not greasy! It's just the right amount of moisture without making your face look oily or dry. It's been great for my rosacea and I love that it is fragrance free. Great job Olay! I'm excited to see how it continues to help my skin look younger as I continue to use it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total - ly awesome!!! I love Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 because it makes your skin so creamy and soft without leaving that grease all over your fingertips from applying it. It soaks in to your face and doesn't sit on top like alot of other moisturizers. You can actually see a difference within a weak, the wrinkles are not as pronounced and it just gives a brightness to your face. i love it because it it not one of those creams that everyone can not afford, it is reasonable priced and works well, what more could you ask for A pleasant fragrance Why yes, it has that too!

love me some Oil of Olay! I am a long time fan of Oil of Olay products so i jumped at the chance to try this. It will be joining the list of products I love for my face. I have been told I look younger than my age before and I hope this product will keep me with a youthful appearance. One of its qualities that has me hooked is the fact that it does not feel greasy at all! That is a huge bonus when I look for face products! And it doesn't leave my skin crying for more hydration later in the day. Smells good too! Definitely will be passing on the good word about this moisturizer!

"First Application I received my trial size Olay Total Effects 7 In One in the mail on Friday. I am excited that I was chosen to try it. Yesterday was the first day I applied the product and I have to say I love the way it went on my skin, leaving my skin soft and smooth. It didn't take long to absorb into the skin. I also like the fact that it is one easy application that takes care of all 7 benefits. Of course with one application I was not able to see a difference as of yet but I will continue using the product til it is all used up and then post a before and after photo.

"Age Defying Since receiving and using my sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I am truly pleased with the results I have noticed. The unique vitamin complex has made my wrinkles and age spots almost all but vanished and my skin looks and feels so much softer. I have received compliments from friends and family at how much younger I look and I have since purchased this product and will continue to use and recommend it to my family and friends.

"Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer I think it's the best anti-aging moisturizer I've try so far and I'm so amaze by the product. My skin feel smooth, fresh and just after 2 weeks I can already see a difference in my skin tone. I use to buy any anti-aging moisturizer as long as it was on special because from one to the other it's approximatly the same, no surprise no change. With Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti-aging I was able to see and feel the difference PLUS it smell so good! It's been a long time I haven't been satisfy with a product. I highly recommend it to every women!! Thank you! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Works even in extreme conditions! I wanted to try this product for a couple of weeks before writing this review. I have used Olay Total Effects every morning for 15 days and I must confess that the results are impressive! I am a young woman, but this product has proven me that my skin can look even younger and healthier! From the first day I noticed the skin tone to look different. My skin stays hydrated the whole day even when I go out in the snow. After two weeks, fine lines also disappeared and the skin definitely looks healthier. Thank you very much for this product, I recommend it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effects I love this product. I have used various olay moistuizers for the past 20 years but am stuck on this one. It wasnt sticky but rather went on nice and smooth. My skin absorbed it immediately, there was no greasy residue which really sucks when putting your makeup on over it. It almost seemed like a pick me up as before putting in on my skin looks dehydrated and tired but looked refreshed after applying. I will definately purchase this moisturizer This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice procuct I've been using this for a couple of weeks now. It goes on very nicely, smooth and absorbs easily and quickly, it feels nice when I apply it, not greasy at all. It has a nice scent, not overpowering. I don't need to use a lot of it, a little squeeze will do my whole face. I have noticed a bit of a difference in my fine lines, they look a little less noticeable. My skin seems softer, more moisturized. All in all I'm really happy with Total Effects, I will be buying another bottle when my little sample runs out. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Dry skin Be Gone!!!! I have tried so many products to hydrate my skin. I have been on numerous medications for a medical condition and even though I am finished they ruined my complexion. But Regenerist Deep Hydration to the rescue..tah dah!!!! In one week my skin felt on the mend and has continued to improve. It is definitely moist and supple. I know, because I have been receiving compliments. Love it!!!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love this Olay!! I got this Olay Total Effects 7 in one anti-aging moisturizer to try for free. I loved that this product is not greasy and absorbed into my skin right away. I have been looking a long time for a non greasy moisturizer. You cannot tell that you are wearing a moisturizer. My skin felt so soft after. So far i have noticed that my skin is more even and i will be repurchasing this and using it for years to come! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Olay Its a good great cream for you use and anyone else and it also smells good
"BEST MOISTURIZER I wasn't expecting much when I first got this moisturizer, as I haven't had much luck with past moisturizers but I have to say - OMG! This moisturizer is incredible. After using it religiously for the past 2 weeks I can say my skin has improved, to the point that other people have noticed! My skin tone is even, it's not dry, its not oily - it's literally perfect! I haven't even had any breakouts since using it. INCREDIBLE product will recommend this to everyone I know/ I've already been recommending it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great results overall I can't get over the fact that thia product makes feel more confident.
"The best I asked my mom for this at Xmas as well as other Olay products, she's used Olay since I was a little girl, I'm 44 now...I absolutely love this product! I've always had uneven skin color since I was young, I've used it daily for two weeks and I'm using less foundation and noticed even without makeup my skin tone is more balanced! Id recommend this product to anyone with uneven skin tones! It works and it's not greasy...goes on smooth and does what it says! Try it, you won't be disappointed! Worth every prnny"
"Multi-tasking Moisturizer I have really been enjoying the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer. I wanted to use the sample for a few weeks before I wrote up my review to give the best and most detailed review. My initial thoughts of the moisturizer were that it went on smoothly and it was very light. The consistency of the moisturizer is light and non-greasy. It absorbs quickly and easily into the skin. The moisturizer does have a nice fresh scent that I really enjoy. It is not at all overwhelming (though I am not sensitive to scents and those who are might feel it is too strong). Honestly, I did not notice a difference in my skin after the first few days, nor did I expect to see one. However, after about a week, I did notice that my skin felt more supple. Some of my fine lines were slowly diminishing - not completely invisible, but definitely less apparent. I don't have any deep set wrinkles - yet - and so, I cannot comment on whether this moisturizer works well to minimize deep wrinkles. I think it is a good all in one product. I am not sure of what the price will be once it is on the shelf, and thus, I cannot say whether it is a good value compared to other similar products. However, I think if you're spending money on anti-aging products and moisturizers that you use separately, you can definitely save money by using just the one product that targets more than one skin concern. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Amazing and excellent product Before I started using this product, I didn't have much expectation. I thought it might be another product with over advertisement of what it can do. After two weeks of testing, all of a sudden I realize my face has brighten up, silky soft, and very moisturized. Even just the first day of use, I already felt a big difference to my skin. Comparing my skin in the past which is dull and dry, after usage have completely turn my skin around. Now I feel so my confident walking out as I look much younger. Amazing! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love the texture and odor plus the results! When I first used I was surprised by the texture and odor. The texture was smooth and creamy making just one pump from the bottle give me full coverage of my entire face. Also the smell is not overpowering or too much and it dissipates fast. I've been using for 1 week and I feel like my skin is brighter and not so tired and blotchy looking. I went to a Holiday party and one of the other guest I haven't seen in a long while asked my how I look like I never age! Well this definately helps!

olay total effect To start off the cream feels so rich and smooth when you apply it. Compared to the cream I am using now it is so silky and smooth. I noticed my fine lines start to fade with in 4 days. My skin also feels firmer. I have not noticed my age spots or scars fade after 2 weeks of use. It is great that it includes sunscreen since I am a busy mom who not always applies it. The cream stings when I got in my eyes from my eyes watering from the cold. Overall I love the feel of the cream and it seems to be improving my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"I found the Anti-Aging Moisturizer for me!!! I was having a difficult time finding a anti-aging regime for myself as my skin was sensitive to most of the products that I tried. I'm so happy to have tried Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer!! It actually does everything that it claims to! It provides all day moisturizer, my age spots are barely visible, my skin looks and feels so much better and my skin tone is so much brighter. I also love having the added bonus of a sun screen!! I've already purchased this product and I will continue to do so! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
I love this product I use this product all the time. My skin is always soft and feels great. It helps regenerate my skin so it always looks good and I get many complements on how I look because I use this cream. I love all the Olay products that I have used but like this particular one the best. I am very proud to be using such a wonderful product. I would recommend it to anyone.and be happy to do so.

"Olay has done it again I think when you have trouble skin like me it is hard to find something that works all day, and continues working for everyday that you use it. Well Olay 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer does just that and more. I am no longer afraid to show my skin off, and no longer afraid to meet new people because my skin is no longer red and inflamed. I love Olay and they have done it again Olay7in1 bzzagent gotitfree This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Another Olay win! I have been using Olay Total Effects for a few weeks now, and my current opinion is that it is a great product! The first week however, I found that I was breaking out with small whiteheads. I am not sure if that is just my skins way of adjusting, but it stopped, so it's all good now. The product seemed thick to me at first, as I am used to a much thinner moisturizer. But it feels silky as you apply it, and one small pump does my whole face. I love the scent! The only complaint I have is that I want a bigger bottle! :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loved this cream! I received a fee trial size of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer before Christmas. Olay promotes that you will notice a difference in 4 weeks...I noticed after a week and a half. My skin was definitely more even-toned and the fine lines were not as noticeable. I loved it so much, I went out and bought myself the full size of both the day and night cream. This cream is very reasonably priced, and definitely won't be going back to my more expensive creams that I have used in the past. Loved it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Total Effects I think the Total Effects brand of Olay is great!. I already am an Olay girl but have never used the more expensive stuff but I think from now on I will! Loved that there was just a light fragrance, nothing too over powering. The moisture was fantastic. Usually this time of year my face gets so dried out but using this cream the past month it has been sily smooth. Will be purchasing this product in the future!

Love the way my skin feels gotitFreeOlayUS and I LOVE IT I love the way my skin feels after using it I am sad it won't be in the stores until February as I don't know what I am going to use in the mean time THANKS BZZAGENT :) I am so happy to be one of the first to try this product. This is a must buy for me when it comes out :) My skin feels like it is tightening and I have freckles and I can see them fading a bit after using this for 4 days now This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Pleasantly Surprised I am so impressed with this Olay product. I have never had good experiences with Olay and always ended up with breakouts. I have always been a Clinique only user but the light weight yet effective and non greasy feeling has made me start to reconsider. When at Costco today I saw a bottle of this in the beauty products aisle and did not hesitate in purchasing more. I am so impressed I plan to continue to use this product and look forward to seeing if the longer effects can continue to compare with my Clinique experiences.

"Olay Total Effects I am very skeptical when trying creams. I don't like them greasy or smelly. Trying out Olay total effects, I found it to feel like their was nothing on my skin. It was very light weight and had a nice odour to it. After using it for just 4 days, I had complements that my complexion looked clean and smooth. As my friend always says I was having a great face day. And upon continuing using it, the great face day became a Great face week. I really enjoyed this product and will continue to purchase it once it is release. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Feeling radiant Since using Olay total effects my skin feels and looks like it's glowing. My pores have definitely shrunk and my skin tone looks so much more even. I barely see the crows feet that I noticed before I started using this product. Olay totalk effects 7 in 1 is now my fav go to cream. Goes on nicely and with a pump of the bottle you have just the right amount everytime. Definitely glad I got to try this out! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Beautiful Worth every penny smells wonderful and makes my skin fill soft and moister line seem to fade
"My skins feels young and fresh! When I first got Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging moisturizer, I was a bit skeptical. I have tried anti-aging moisturizer creams before with little luck. Was I ever surprised when I noticed my skin looked brighter, younger and overall just a fresh look, in addition to feeling so soft. I think the smaller size would be great for someone wanting to try a new product without having to commit to a full size, but I think that they'll just be disappointed when run out and head out to buy the biggest one available!

Fine lines and age spots are both GONE I used Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and noticed a great improvement to my skin. I had blemishes and uneven skin tone around my chin area and now it is all gone. The fine lines around my eyes have completely disappeared. My skin was glowing and looked healthier thanks to the unique vitamin complex in the product. The results are remarkable and noticeable only after a few days of usage. It also smells great. This is the most amazing moisturizer I have used and actually works miracles on the skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"It really works! Ok, so I got my sample and I've been using it for about 1 week now, and I've already seen amazing results. My skin is a lot firmer, it glows, and less wrinkles, it also smells really good after you apply it. I just purchased the full sized bottle, and I'm so excited to try it out for 1 month now to see extra results! This is a miracle in a bottle, and its worth every last penny! Some products work for some, and some products don't work for some people, but you have to try it for at least 1 month to get extra results. My new go to facial creme!

"Really great stuff I received my trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer free 10 days ago, and I have been using it every morning since i t came. I have noticed really great results. The slight wrinkles around my eyes have shrunk, and my skin looks a lot more bright and even toned (I am prone to having red blotches all over my face) I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wanta to have younger, healthier looking skin in just days!

"It worked for me! The Olay Total effects 7 in 1 worked wonders for me. Not only did it brighten my whole face, it tightened my skin, made it so soft to the touch and the subtle smell is quite pleasant. The trial size in itself is a cute little bottle perfect for travel. It is nice and creamy when you apply it, but it also penetrates your skin fast, and does not leave a greasy residue. I have only been using it for a week, and I can already see a difference in the texture of my skin. I will continue to use it and am looking forward to see more results in the future.

Fabulous!! I have been using Olay products since I was in my teens and I am now in my late 40's. I am always told that I look younger than my real age! Total Effects doesn't feel greasy or heavy. I can use Olay year round and I don't perspire in the summer since it's so light on my skin which tells me that it soaks right in which is what you want from a face moistureizer. I love all of Olay's products and alot of times it's very hard to choose which cream/cleanser I want! Thank you for keeping me looking young which makes me feel great about myself!
"Loving Olay Total Effects! It has been quite a few years since I've used an Olay product. The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has been just wonderful. The scent is pleasant and isn't too strong. The moisturizer feels amazing on my face, not too greasy and does a great job moisturizing my dry skin. I've definitely noticed a difference. Someone even mentioned that I loved different. Not sure if it has to do with the Olay, but it's very possible. Once I finished the trial size, i went out and bought the full size. I definitely recommend this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My face feels fabulous! This product is excellent! It's lightweight and goes on non greasy! I can put it on and then do my make up with no issues. The pump dispenses in one light push enough product to do one's face and neck! It goes a long way. My skin is smoother, firmer and brighter. I think I need to look if they have an eye cream in this line too--help with those dark circles. At 47 I am very pleased with how my skin is looking. This product is a keeper! Definitely!

"Amazing it works I have found that olay total effects works wonders on the skin. I have always been an olay fan, as was my mother and grandmother, but this product takes the one I am using and pushes it to the back of the shelf. My skin is softer and smoother and more radiant. My friends have noticed and have commented on how great my skin looks and they have always said I look younger than I am, but now they say it even more. I am switching for sure. In fact I already went out and bought one but the one with SPF in it. I just cannot get over how my skin looks. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Good Is a good product but it would be better if it was a little bit cheaper and be able to be bought very much money in their pocket
"Fountain of Youth I've absolutely loved the Olay total effects moisturizer. Instantly on application my skin feels more moisturized and healthy. After only a couple weeks of use I've noticed improved skin tone with fewer dark spots. My eyes look less tired, giving me a fresher, younger look. I've never had results this quickly from an anti-aging treatment before. Can't wait to see what will happen after longer use time. This is one I'll stick with!

Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturize Hi Been trying to test Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a week so far . At the start looked at the packaging and found the colours a bit dark but when a open and tried it love the smell very light perfume scent. Put the cream on my face a found it smooth not greasy drys fast and hydrate the skin and does hide the wrinkles a bit in my case so far after one week. Does not take much to cover face and neck so i find it would be worth the try to buy this product even as the price is a bit high but will last long .

"Fight the signs of aging! Thank you bzzagent for allowing me to try this product! This is a very nice product. . It has a light, almost fragrance free, scent. The texture is so smooth and the product is concentrated so you hardly need any to moisturize your whole face. After using this product for a few weeks, I've noticed my skin is much more hydrated, and no breakouts! My pores have decreased in size, which is wonderful as I feel they had been looking more noticeable before trying this lotion. I do recommend this product, you won't be disappointed! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer After using this product for a little over 2 weeks, I've noticed my skin looks more radiant and fine lines around my eye and cheek area seem less noticeable. My skin seems more supple and all I've changed in my routine is add this Olay anti-aging moisturizer in. I feel confident that the vitamin complex they've included are doing their work! I also liked the consistency of the moisturizer and how it absorbed into my skin. It didn't leave me feeling greasy and my sensitive skin did not feel any irritation at all. Great product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Wonderful I've only been using this product a short time, however, I absolutely love it. I love the smell, I love how it feels when I'm putting the lotion on. It's like putting cashmere on my face."
"Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize! I really enjoyed using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer because it felt great and the effects were long lasting! When I applied the lotion there was no irritation to my skin and it felt rich. I applied it all over my face before bed and when I woke, my skin felt moisturized and plump! As I am in my 20s, I don't have any issues with age spots or uneven skin tone however I did feel that it helped smooth out the very fine lines under my eyes. I have combination-oily skin, and this lotion did not break out at all! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Was not expecting this It is not the kind of brand I am normally purchasing and was not expecting much. I loved it! I have an incredible glow and I love the texture of my skin! Im only 36 and is was not to much for my skin: it nurrish but did not make my face oily. I live in Canada and it is a good cream to protect in cold temperature (it is already freezing). I had the ''with perfume'' version of it and I really hated the cheap odor of it: powdery low cost perfume like... I just learned that it comes in non-fragrance version: I will buy it. Loved it!

"Mother's advice I have been using Olay Total Effects Daily Face Moisturizer for the past 10 years and of all the expensive products out there this is the best and cost the less. Oil of Olay is what my mom used her whole life and always told me not to spend my money on those expensive creams after turning 40 and having a set of twins, I tried it and will never use anything else, my skin does not look like a 53 year old (so they tell me) - and I always tell people when they ask me about my skin - it the Total Effects - even my 2 boys use it too. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Amazing results When I received this product I was believing that nothing could help my large poressmall wrinkles that were appearing and the mild damage I have from acne except using a lot of make up. After using this product for only seven days I decided to go into work at a retirement home with no makeup on everyone asked me why I always wore so much make up my skin looked healthy and without the makeup I looked younger than I am. I will continue to use this product every day and will tell my friends and family at Christmas about this amazing product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Olay total effects .. forever young (my review) So I got a small bottle of Olay Total effects face cream. It came in a cute package - very informative. I was excited to see if it would improve my dry skin. So at night I opened it up. I was concerned it would go on oily but it didn't, immediately soaked up in my skin. I didnt feel itchy or feel like there was any residue. I really liked that. After a couple days I felt it improved the fine lines around my eyes, and my skin seemed to glow more. I kinda felt younger, crazy huh I would definitely try this again, wish the bottle was bigger! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Awesome Younger Skin Yea Me I think it's working don't you: Fine lines smaller.... Check Dry skin gone.... Check Dark circles going.... Check Firming up skin..... Check Age spots.... Not a problem yet Uneven skin tone... Not a problem Reduces sizes of pores.... Haven't noticed a problem with mine before I really love this product, they( Olay) have really hit one out of the ball park with this one( Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer ). Not to mention getting it free with the GotitFree. It really doesn't get better than that. It's a win win situation. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This product works amazing This product smells amazing because of all the various types of vitamins they have in it to help your face
"Beautiful Skin I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about a week now. My skin has not not felt so soft, so smooth, and beautiful to the touch. It smells nice, a little goes a long way, and it is easily absorbed into the skin, no greasy residue, or waiting for skin to dry. Sometimes I have to thinks...did I actually put moisturizer on because it blends right into your skin. I had a dry patch of skin just by my lip in the corner, and it cleared it up in just two days. I can't say enough good things about this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay 7-in-1 Anti Aging Moisturizer I think that the Olay 7-in-1 Anti Aging Moisturizer that I was given for free to try out is great. I have tried it and 100 will use this for the rest of my life. My girlfriends had to admit that the fine lines under my eyes are far less than they were and it made my face look not only younger but also fresher and livelier. The dullness disappears after using it for a short time and it actually has 7 advantages in one cream. I must admit that this is one of the few products that does everything it says it will! Love you Olay.. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love it! Love it! Love it! Absolutely love this product and will continue to buy it. I have nothing negative at all to say about it. I love the way it feels on my skin has a nice fragrance, isnt sticky dries quickly. My mother has always used olay products growing up and now that I am grown up I am doing the same and I can see why. I definitely have gotten a better complexion overall from using olay and my skin feeling more firm and brighter making me happier! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I love Olay! The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is amazing. My mom uses this moisturizer all of the time, but I never got around to trying it. Since Ive been using this moisturizer I notice that my skin texture has transformed. I use to have many dry patches, and there is a noticeable improvement. And best of all I can wear it under my make-up without it feeling heavy. I would definitely recommend this moisturizer to everyone. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"awesome product, recomend This stuff is amazing. I know of this moisturizer because my friend uses it all the time. She is well in her 50's and gets compliments about her skin every time she is in public. Skincare is extremely important for me. I'm very picky when it comes to skin care products. I've been using this product for a while now, and it's been the first moisturizer in a long time that has been a repeat purchase for me. My skin looks and feels great. I use the fragrance and sunscreen-free version at night . It's been a great cream for my sensitive skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love this cream Have not been using this for to long , but so far I am impressed with all it has to offer! I love that a little really goes a long way, It Is very hydrating , my face actually feels firmer looks brighter! I feel this will last around 4 months using 2x a day, or even 6+ months If used once a day! All In all I feel this Is a very nice cream especially compared to high end creams I have tried. This one does what it says who doesnt love saving money!! If your on the fence with this one you really should give it a try, It's worth it . This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great all in one product I think this product is great and perfect for a person who is on the go. I used this product for 4 weeks. It had a nice texture and light scent. I usually have oily skin and have never used Olay products on my face. However this product was light on my face. I was not able to see a difference on my dark spots and uneven skin tone. I would definitely buy this product for travelling as it saves space and has all I need in one bottle. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"New Satisfied Customer I love this product! So much so that Ian replacing my old anti-aging cream with Total effects Oil of Olay 7 in 1. Once my sample was done I reverted back to my old cream was disappointed. In comparison, it's very oily which doesn't sit under make up well wasn't working my face lines as well as the Oil of Olay! I'm telling people - there is a significant difference I will be switchinv my brand choice now- which is great because Oil of Olay isn't as much as my old product as well! It works and it's affordable - worth every penny! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Great Product!!! I am in my 20s so I don't focus on smoothing fine lines and wrinkles BUT the other benefits I have experienced from using this product make it amazing!! I sometimes feel that my skin looks dull and grey but I could see a huge difference after just one use!! I only use this moisturizer at night because I feel that it works better. I also have hyper-pigmentation from my acne and this moisturizer has lightened so many of my dark spots!! I have not experienced any breakouts and my skin is glowing and it feels incredibly smooth. Thank you Olay!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Awesome Awesomely awesome with a hint of epicness for skin
"What a relief! I moved 1,000 miles across the country and my new environment has really been wrecking havoc on my skin. I had bought a bottle of Total Effects a long time ago, but never really used it... But, I picked it up again once I started noticing how horrible my skin felt. I'm so glad I picked up that bottle again! All the weird dry patches have gone away! This product really does feel lovely on your skin... Hoping I'll see some other results with continued use."
"Just Perfect! I already tried some anti-aging moisturizer to fight the signs of aging, but I never saw significant results. When I started to try this product, in the first day, I was already enchanted. This product has a very nice smell, spreads well on the skin, but you need to put just a small quantity of the product in your skin, because some residues can be formed (like some clusters). This is good, because the product will last longer and the results are perfect using just a little bit of the product. The skin also stays very hydrated, which is perfect in winter.

"I am so happy Hey I was wondering if any anti aging cream ever worked. I never tried any creams as I just thought they would never work. So when I got the chance to try the olay total effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer I was like sure not that I believed it would work. Well was I proven wrong. It's been a week and I can see the difference in my skin already. Around my eyes where I have laugh lines, they are getting smaller. My skin is getting softer and firmer at the same time. If anyone asked me I would recommend this product to them in a heart beat...which I have done. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice Glow to Your Skin his is my first time using Olay Total Effects and I was happy when Bzzagent ask me to try it out. I used this product for a few weeks and I received a trail size of this product to review. The olay Total Effects 7 says it will help you fight seven signs of aging including visibly smooth fine lines and wrinkles, even skin tone apperance, minimizes the look of pores, visibly reduces age spots, restores firmness and replenishes moisture. I have an oily t-zone and the moisturizer was light on my skin and did not make my skin oily or greasy. It took about a week for me to notice results on my skin. I noticed that it even my skin tone around my jaw and nose. Those areas on my face are really red. My skin appeared to be more firmer and softer. I had some people ask me what kind of make-up am I using because my skin had a nice glow and I told them the only thing different that I am using is the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 moisturizer. My friends like it and can't wait to start using it. It gave me a nice glow to my skin without me having to highlight my face. My mom is looking forward to using this product because the product claims that it will smooth fine lines. I told her it made a difference in my skin tone apperance and firmness in the skin. The other added bonus that I like about this moisturizer is the added sunscreen. I am so happy with the results that I wish the sample was full size not a trial one. Thanks Bzzagent.

"Miracle Moisturizer Both of the ladies I got to try this were stunned by the results. Their skin looks lighter, appears smoother and the fine lines are still teir but they are much less noticeable. Its almost like there is a light reflector or something because they are glowing. They also seem to have more confidence and smile alot more now. Its amazing what a simple, great and inexpensive moisturizer can do for a lady on the outside and the inside. Great product great results This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Even and Soft Skin from Olay Total effects 7-in-1 After using Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 for 2 weeks. I squeezed out the final few drops of facial moisturizer from my 15ml container last night and have added it to my shopping list. My skin is remarkable! It is more even, very soft, has a beautiful glow. It is very easy to love this product and chat with friends and co-workers about something I know works and works well for my skin. I was sad to see the last drops from the bottle empty out, however the result of my face brightening and clarifying is exciting. My minor sun spots had faded in just two weeks!

"A Great Skin Product! I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer GotItForFree is a wonderful product. I tend to have problems with very dry skin that never seems to have a glow to it. After trying this skin product I have noticed an overall difference. My skin looks hydrated with a nice glow, the fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeable, as well as there is a more even skin tone. I'm not sure the last time my skin felt so soft. If you are looking for a skin care product that provides you with soft, radiant, smooth and even toned skin.....give this one a try. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Simply Fantastic. I live in a very dry climate and this moisturizer is a dream. I am not even concerned about the antiaging characteristics at this point. It feels so lovely on my skin, previously i had used clinique but it felt too watery and like i hadn't put anything on my face (is. back to dry and itchy) within minutes after application. This Olay however is so soft and creamy to apply, and makes my skin feel naturally hydrated all day. it definitely outdid my expectations. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smoother skin in less than a month! What I really enjoyed most about Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer was how smoothly it went on and left my skin feeling silky as it went to work. Within a week, my skin appeared brighter and at the three-week mark, the fine lines on my face were visibly reduced. One friend asked if I'd been to a spa lately because I looked so refreshed. The unique vitamin complex not only improved the appearance of my skin, but smoothed out the texture as well. Thank you, Olay! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Great Results Using Regenerist This is my favorite cream because it does exactly as advertised. I have been using it for three years and am never disappointed with the results. My skin is not only soft but youthful with that certain glow that other women recognize and mention to me. I plan on using this cream as long as it is available to me. Thank you for keeping it on the market and no changes, please. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Welcome to the family. I have used Olay products since my 20's (back then it was called Oil of Olay). And have not changed brands since. I love this Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I use it as an eye cream to complement my Olay Regenerist facial moisturizer and it works. It helps minimize the appearance of fine lines around my eyes. It is a nice thick cream and restores the moisture around that senstive area of the face. It is the welcome addition to my daily moisturizing routine.

"Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer When I first started using this product, my face broke out around the T-Zone but eventually cleared again. Maybe my skin was just adjusting to a new product. My skin seemed soft and supple after using this product, probably due to its unique Vitamin complex. The most obvious change in my skin was how even my complexion became. You only need to use a pea size to cover your entire face and neck, any more would be overkill. LOVE it and would definitely recommend this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Amazing moisturizer The Olay Total Effects Anti Aging Moisturizer really made a diffence on the appears of darks spots around my eyes and on a few fine lines around my eyes , my skin was also a lot softer and firmer with each use of the Olay Total Effects Anti aging moisturizer . Also my pores look less noticeable . I can't believe how amazingly soft my face and neck have become and I like that Olay Total Effects Anti Aging Moisturizer is fragrance free with getting a little older I have noticed that my skin has become really sensitive to different things that aren't fragrance free This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Total Effects I think that Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging cream is Amazing.. I have tried a number of different moisturizers and none seem to work as well as Olay total effects. I have been using this moisturizer for almost 2 weeks now morning and evening and it has proved to stand up to everything it has offered. My skin feels smoother my wrinkles are not as noticeable is is as though my skin has blended into itself.. I would not have believed that this product would work so we unless gotitfree from buzz agent but I will defently be purchasing this product..Olay Total Effects This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love This Moisturzer I have always used Olay products on my skin. As I am now 47, I've been thinking I should start using a product that is specifically for anti-aging purposes. Olay has not let me down. This product does exactly what it claims it will. I have received so many compliments on my skin. I even ran into an old high school friend at the mall who said you haven't changed a bit. I know I have but I know the Olay helps me to keep looking my best. I love that this product has sunscreen in it and is perfect for sensitive skin like mine. I will definitely purchase this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Awesome consistency and fragrance As a Bzz agent, I got a free chance to try Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Mositurizer and I love it! A soft fragrance and a perfect consistency were the top two features for me. My skin feels so my softer and the wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable after using this produc for about two weeks. It's not greasy at all and absorbs very quickly. I went out to buy a full-sized bottle for myself since the sample is almost gone. I can't say enough about this cream! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects Olay Total Effects smells amazing! It's soft and subtle and reminds me of mom :) I love how silky smooth my face feels after I apply, and how soft my skin has continued to feel since I've been using the moisturizer. My skin seems brighter and the finer lines seem to be a little less noticeable. The pump dispenses the perfect amount so there's no waste plus it's more convenient than a tub. I'll definitely consider buying this product to see if the lines continue to dissipate, although I may have to consider the fact that it may be time to start using a night cream ) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Amazingly great! Though it didn't reduce my age spots and fine lines ('cause I don't have them right now! and hopefully they won't come till I am age 70+!) it did reduce my dark spots and pimple marks (those that I thought wouldn't leave my face anymore!), though I still have a few, most of them are already gone and those that I still in there, they are lighter and less visible now! :D Thanks to OlayUs Gotitfree Thanks toBzzAgent for making me try this amazingly great product!

"Loving Olay Total Effects This is an awesome product from a fantastic brand, one of the best products I've been lucky enough to receive to review. I came into this trial with the cutest little sample, lucky a little goes a long way. Initially I was hoping to find softer, even toned skin and was happy to discover Olay Total Effects performs as advertised. The anti-aging effects are fabulous - I have noticed less redness on my face which makes a huge difference in my appearance, I never thought my skin would look firmer and feel as smooth as it does. Thank you BzzAgent and thank you Olay This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"This product delivers Many products make great promises that remain promises only. Olay Regenerist moisturizer delivers on its promise to regenerate, moisturize, and visibly reduce wrinkles (in as little as two weeks.) I was challenged to compare the results of this product with two others that promised the same results. Olay Regenerist moisturizer delivered (for me) where the other two did not.

"Go and buy this to whom ever has any of these skin concerns please go and buy! you will see amazing results. I always thought you needed to by expensive products for results and Olay gives them to you affordable. the texture and glowing skin that I've achieved in such a small amount of time are fantastic! my pores appear smaller. I don't really have wrinkles ,thanks to good genetics. thx mom and dad lol. my makeup goes on smoothly and doesn't look cake. I'm about one pump away from going and getting a full size bottle. I will be checking out the other products in this line as well. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A surprise for my skin I was nervous to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer. Surely, a trial size wouldn't be enough to see 1 result on my skin, let alone 7, but I'm here to say that's exactly what it's done. My skin tone has a more even appearance, it feels bright and firm and it is extremely soft. I didn't think I could believe such a small bottle would have such a large impact on my skin, but I'm definitely heading out to buy a full size bottle! Thank you Olay.

"A great moisturizer so far!!!!! I have so many skin allergies and have only found one moisturizer that doesn't make me break out to date. I was really reluctant to try this product ... no ... scared to try it. However, I'm glad I did. I've only used it for 3 days now (I usually react within an hour of application). I love the fresh clean smell and it glides on very smooth. It also absorbs very quickly so I don't feel like I have gunk on my face. And the benefit (other than smooth, younger looking skin!!) is....No reaction! I'm going to keep using it! So far I'm loving it!! And my skin does too!!

Love my new look! Well I have tried many products that promised to help with my fine lines and uneven skin tone. I finally found the product that lives up to its promise. I wanted a product that did not leave a heavy residue but something that went into my skin not sat on top. I have sensitive skin so I needed something not too heavy. This Olay Total Effects worked great for me. The product gave my skin a healthy glow. My husband even commented on my skin. Something he has never done. My skin doesn't feel thirsty anymore and I noticed my makeup blends better. Love the new Olay! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Pretty as can be! GotItFree OlayUS and I love it! I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer for the past 4 weeks and the changes are definitely noticeable! My skin feels tighter, my pores are less visible. The tone of my skin is evened out and my face never feels dry! I absolutely love it! I can't say that I look younger and have quit aging but I would bet that by using this moisturizer I've definitely slowed the aging process. My skin feels healthier and that alone will slow aging! I will continue to use Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer. Thanks for a great new product OlayUS This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Glowing Results I have been using Olay Total Effects for weeks now and I am so happy with the reults. My skin literally feels like it is glowing and I have to thank the unique vitamin complex in this moisturizer for continuing to make my skin look younger and healthier. Olay Total Effects lives up to it's promise to fight the 7 signs of aging but for me personally I am most impressed with my now ongoing even skin tone. I was always self conscious about that and now I don't feel I have to cake on makeup to try and even out my skin. I recommend Olay Total Effects to anyone wanting to feel good about their skin!!

Sold My New Anti-Aging Moisturizer This new moisturizer has sold me it even's out my skin tone to avoid the redness in my cheecks from rosacea and eczema on both sides of my nose. I can feel it just melting into the fine lines and giving my face a great overall balance in tone. It adds brightness and smooth softness to the skin once blended. I usually don't like cream moisturizers as I do not like the feeling on my skin and I believe it blocks pores. This product is light and fluffy and I am enjoying it to the fullest and have received many compliments on how great my skin looks. This is my new brand of moisturizer and I love it.

"WOW just WOW I've used a lot of different types of moisturizers and nothing compares to this. I have roseca so my pigment is very red. I've noticed when using Olay total effects that the redness has gone down, and also the patchy dry skin is disappearing. In my 30's I've been blessed with very few fine lines, and now I can't see any again. This is a travel size version and I have been using it liberally for 2 weeks straight and still haven't run out. I would highly recommend this product for every day use, but I would definitely recommend the travel size for when going away or just to keep in your purse or car.

"OLAY EXPERIENCE My experience with Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer was great. It went on smooth, not greasy or thick. The 7-in-1 formula with skin conditioners kept my face and neck well hydrated and soft. Its vitamins and antioxidants didn't really hide any age spots, the appearance of pores were less visible , and I still had the fine lines and wrinkles. I have only used it for a week and i think it would need tl be used longer in order to judge if it would visibly promote less signs of aging for younger-looking skin, although my skin does look much better and I will forever use the Olay product line.

"Lighter, Brighter Face I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 is an amazing product. I used to have large pores and saggy skin but after using this for numerous weeks my pores have shrunk and my skin is nice and firm. I have has numerous people comment on how bright my face looks. I look years yonger and I believe that if I continue using it, it can only get better. This product goes on smooth and light and does not fell greasy. I am a true believer of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 and will continue using it for the forseable future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"It has a fragrance of its on, love it Been using it since 1988.i always ask for the newest at christmas time and birthdays. Its a great product"
Great Product I love this product and It's really good for my skin and my pores.
Olay total effects 7 in 1. A must try! I think this product is great. It took care of my dry spots without my skin feeling greasy or heavy. It really seemed to soak into my skin immediately. There was a big difference just in the tone of my skin and the colour. My face looked healthier and felt amazing it made me feel good about my appearance even with no makeup at all. I never usually put anything on my face but makeup and soap and water. I thought the tired looking skin was all there was. I kind of hoped I didn't need anything and so long as my skin was clean I was doing good right. Wrong. I'll be picking up more! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great Moisturizer I would like to thank Olay and BzzAgent for giving me the opportunity to test Olays Total Effects..I was anxious to try this because I had read a lot about it prior to this testing opportunity and its claim that this moisturizer helps fight the seven signs of aging so skin looks up to 10 years younger in just four weeks..I grew up watching my mother use olay products and always thought of them as quality products so I was excited to give it a try..the firt time I used this product was after a shower and I loved the light fresh scent..the bottle has a nice pump applicator that is very easy to use and dispenses just the right amount of product..the cream itself is a nice rich cream color which has a nice thick consistency ..it has a luxurious feel to it and absorbs very nicely into the skin..it leaves your skin feeling great even after the first application..I found that after my second application my face almost had a glow about it and my skin felt sooo soft..by the time I got to the end of the bottle I can truly say I seen an improvement in my skin texture and brightness..I have combination skin and find a lot of moisturizers on the market either too greasy or too drying for my skin type but this olays total effects dealt with my skin issues great and had no drying or greasy effect what so ever..I would definitely buy this product and highly recommend it..another great quality product from olay This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Keeps My Skin Hydrated in Winter Weather I received the package with a sample sized 0.5 oz bottle of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1. The weather was starting to get cold, which is when my skin tends to get really dry and flaky. The moisturizer that I was using at the time wasn't doing enough to keep my skin hydrated and it was starting to get white and flaky. After my first use I noticed immediate results. The flakiness disappeared after just one use! The cream is light and foamy, not greasy at all. I'm amazed that it moisturizers so well without leaving my face greasy or oily. Excellent night cream to use in winter. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects Anti Aging Works Im over 40 and my skin is really starting to notice. I had never did paid much attention or worried about wrinkles before 40, or even think about skin tone. I should have, I was happy to try this product out. I'm a redhead with a pale complexion. I need or should be using a product like Olay Total Effects more than others would need to. Every line shows up in my skin. I tried this every morning for a week and noticed my skin looks more even, more moisturized. It doesn't leave an oily feel on my skin and I would continue to use it even after this campaign is over. gotitfree This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So excited! I just got this sample in the mail and was so excited to be selected for this campaign. I am 27 and have been shocked this year to see signs of age on my face already! (I know all people older than me just cringed at that statement :) ) I started to notice wrinkles on my forehead, dark spots on my upper lip, as well as dark spots from previous acne scars. The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer claims to remedy these problems so I hope it stands up to it's promises. If Olay is able to deliver on these promises, I will be purchasing the full size product in February! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
smooth healthy skin I have been using this product for over a week now and I really really like this product. My pores are minimized and my skin looks brighter. This product has done so much for my skin during the winter season like keeping my skin moist and my skin feels sooo firm. Oil free is what i enjoy about this product the most and the non- greasy formula. It absorbes in to my skin so fast and has evened out my skin tone. My face feels soo hydrated. I will most deffinently be using this product from now on. Olay is a name i can really rely on and trust. This product is oily skin approved. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great results with Olay Total Effects I gave the Olay Total Effects sample I got a try and I was very impressed by the results within the first couple of days. It visibly smooths fine lines, evens skin tone appearance, enhances brightness and minimizes the look of pores. I made my mom try it too and her age spots were almost gone! It restores the firmness and you can clearly notice the glow and healthy skin. The results are just amazing. It also moisturized my skin during the winter cold. I truly loved this product and I can honestly say that the results are much better than most expensive creams out there. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Like the effects after a few weeks.. I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anit-Aging mosturizer for a few weeks now and notice that there is a decrease in the small lines around the Crows feet. I just applied a little bit each night at my Crows feet and under my eyes and that is it. My Crows feet lines are smaller and the bags under my eyes are a little lighter. No smell to it, Love that and soft n silky to apply to your eyes. You don't need much to get a nice result. I would Definately buy this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Still going strong! Well, what i say...I am now in love with this product! At first i was a little effy on if it was truly a product for me, after all i had had a break out and my face felt oily. But now after trying this for a few weeks, i am starting to see the results! I have always had a slight krinkle near my eye when i smiled. NOW it's almost just a faint line. I reall didn't think would get this kind of result from a such an inexpensive brand! It's only been a few weeks! But to give some credit i have been drinking a ton more water.But hey why change something that is obviously working! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"How to look years younger.... fast I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is great! I was really doubtful that it would actually do all it claims, but its true! I usually have problems with products close to my eyes, but this is even gentle next to sensitive eyes. I put it on every morning after I've washed my face in the shower. After only a couple of weeks, fine lines are almost gone, age spots have almost disappeared, my face looks healthier and younger than it has in a long time! You don't have to believe me, you just have to try it..... THEN you will believe me! You won't regret it!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
very impressed with olay total effects I have been trying Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and I love how quickly it absorbs into my skin. It is leaving my skin feeling clean and fresh. It is moisturizing without making my skin greasy and my pores are definitely looking smaller. My skin is brighter - I didn't even realize how dull it was until I saw the difference. I have sensitive skin so I was wondering if it would cause blemishes but no problems at all. I will definitely keep using this. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
What an amazing difference in my skin!!!! I think that Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer completely changed the ph balance of my skin for the better. I have smoother looking and feeling skin. I don't notice the lines around my eyes as much and the sun spots from baking in the sun in my youth are way less noticeable. I don't wear as much foundation everyday because of it. It's only been a few weeks and I feel that I look a lot better already. Can't imagine how good my skin will look after months of everyday use.

"A new Top 10 Here's the product: Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Here's the question, does it really work Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles I have crows feet around my eyes, and some around my mouth. After using this for the week, I can see a different around my eyes, not kverly dramatic difference, but there is one. Evens skin tone appearance Id have to say after the week this was the one i noticed first. The product helped sith my redness, and uneveness. If just for that fact, id keep using it. Enhances brightness Yes! Because im fair skinned, and wear makeup each day, my skin can look dull and worn by the end of the day. Using this as part of my routine helped brightwn my skin, and make it look great. Minimizes the look of pores I have visible pores on my nose mostly. I didnt notice a drastic difference with this after the week. Visibly reduces age spots I personally dont have age spots, but after seeing what it has done for my complexion, i have high hopes for the future. Restores firmness Yes! After cleaning, makeup, cleaning, dayly activities, my skin can look a bit droopy. After using this for a week, my skin bounces back nicely after my night wash, and look great come morning. Replenishes moisture Definitely!! I have horribly dry skin. After using this for the week I have definitely noticed a difference in my dry areas. My skin looks and feels so much better. I can say honestly I will be purchasing this product and adding it to my beauty routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
A Treat For Your Face I think this product is great.. I love that its a thick cream and really hydrates your skin. I have dry sensitive skin.. I have trouble finding a moisturizer that will be hydrating but at the same time not irritate my skin and this does it. I went ahead and bought a 100ml bottle of it because I like it so much. I'm 38 and my skin is aging and I believe this will help me age with grace. I even recommended to my friend as she was using an Olay product but wanted something different and she loves it as well.. Its worth getting and you will see for yourself.. Its a Treat for your Face. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Ol for Olay ! I'm so worried because I know I will run put of product before it hits the shelves in February....I keep checking it out in every store I am in...just in case. This is the most highly rated product I have ever sampled, it is just awesome and great, i find after just a couple of weeks of using it I have reduced redness in my facial area and a smoother complexion, It feels great going on and a little goes a log way, the light texture smooths on easily and the faint scent is fresha nd light.

Healthy Looking Moisturized Skin I was looking forward to receiving this sample. I was in the market for a new moisturizer and this couldn't have come at a more perfect time. Being that the weather has gotten cold my skin has become extra dry. I have only started using the Olay Anti Aging moisturizer but so far my skin seems well moisturized and my large pores are looking smaller with daily use. with continued use I am hoping to see some of the other results like a more even skin tone and a brighter complexion. So far I am very happy with this product and will update when I have used this for a longer period of time. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Ole Olay!!!!! I really, really like this product. Its not earth shattering. It probably won't become world famous or a fad product but it is practical, well priced and trust worthy. It feels nice on my skin. It sinks in, doesn't feel oily and isn't sticky. It doesn't have an overpowering smell. It leaves my skin feeling replenished and nice. It wears great on its own or under makeup. This is just a solid product that I will continue to use. I also really like the packaging. The pump is clean and quick.

"Amazing product, hands down! I can't say enough about this product! I live in an area of where the water is hard. My face is always has bumps, rough, dry, and flaking skin. Just after the first use my skin was soft to touch!! Simply amazing, in one use! I have noticed total improvement in fine lines on my forehead! I love the softness of the moisturizer it's like silk. I am recommending to everyone to get this product once it comes out. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is worth it's weight in gold! Love it, my skin is softer and softer everyday! I have tried them all and this one is number 1. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer Since getting this I have been using it twice a day and I love it. I can't wait for it to become available in stores. After using it for only a few days I feel like I can already see the difference. I am a very high stress person and I think it shows my aging. With the unique vitamin complex, I am going to look younger in no time. When this is available in stores I urge everyone to give it a try. I don't see a disappointment happening. A definite 5 start rating. Thanks to Olay for developing a wonderful product, thanks to buzz agent for the chance to try for free. I am so impressed This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"85721747267 The smell is good because made by nature,and this product is not entry a mercury you can feel it in one week later"
"Wow, I am just so impressed! Alright, let's preface this by saying I'm a 37 year-old mom of 3. I'm already pretty lucky in the wrinkle departement (Knock on wood, poo-poo-poo) but what a difference this moisturizer has made. I feel less tightness across my forehead and nose. I feel like I have a glow to my face now. Living in Canada where cold weather wreaks havoc on my skin - this has totally made a difference as winter comes upon us. Easy to apply, smells yummy and doesn't leave a greasy feeling. So so so great !! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
velvety feel this product will fight any anti-aging that you may have. You will see results within the first week. the touch and the feel of this cream is so velvety I love it. That is the first thing that I noticed when I first put the cream on my finger tips to put on my face. I am in the early stage of aging skin. I am always trying new products to achieve results in younger looking skin on my face. This is one product I will recommend and I am sure you will love it as well as I am now. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I loved it It's really cool and this was the first thing I thought of to get this stuff off of my really terrible skin
"Love it I started using this several years ago, and lemme tell ya, I love this product. Within days I feel like my skin is plumper, more supple. It feels so soft and silky, and I have a healthy glow. It doesn't just moisturize your skin, it really improves it, and you can tell. I have discolorations from acne spots on my face and this stuff faded the ones I had in what seemed like days and I haven' t had anymore since I've started using it. The other day someone told me I looked 19 or 20, and I'm 28! I love Olay and will continue to use their products on my skin for years and years to come."
"Olay Total Effects I think this product is wonderful. I have tried many different types of moisturizers and nothing compares to the results of Total Effects. I have very dry skin on my forehead and nose to the point where I get red blotches from the constant flaking and cannot wear make up. In less that 4 weeks all of that disappeared, my skin tone has evened out and yesterday my husband said to me out of the blue, your looking younger today. I said that is an odd comment and he said I am not sure what it is but you just look younger. I will definitely keep buying this product and recommended it to everyone This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Wow goes on smooth and feels great I am totally amazed with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti- aging Moisturizer. It glides on my skin and feels great. One question I would like an answer to is What would I want to know before I get this product Is what is the price. Since for this moisturizer to feel this great, it must be expensive. So all you curious people out their looking for a new moisturizer this product is definitely worth checking out. I feel you have to try this first to be a believer, I will definitely be buying this if the price is right. since usually I am wary of anti aging things. this is a game changer.

"Awesome product,a definitems recommendation I can use this product and my skin feels fresh and smooth. I feel as if it replenishes my skin . I would recommend this product to everyone."
"Was doubtful, Not anymore I use quite expensive facial moisturizer and wasn't too sure this would be anything spectacular. What I love about this product is that it actually cleared up my face after a week. It is so nice and smooth. It helped diminish some of my fine lines from my 3 children! It made my face smoother and glow. I am definitely going to continue to purchase this product. It will also be less expensive than what I have been using for years. Saving money and helping my skin, what can be better than that. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Total Effects I've been using my trial size of Olay Total Effects anti-aging moisturizer for about 2 wks now and I feel I can write a few things. I don't know if I've noticed much difference in fine lines and wrinkles but I haven't been using the product for very long. I have taken before pictures and will take after pictures when this campaign is finished. It has a lovely light scent and goes on very smooth. My skin feels wonderful and the tone is beginning to even out. I have a nice glow about me :) I'm definitely going to buy the full size version of Olay Total Effects and continue to use it to see it's full potential.

"Fan of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 I am an older mom who started using Olay 7 in 1 total effects, and have been very happy with the results. I need a product that is quick to apply and not greasy, and this product definitely fulfills my needs! Also the product did not cause any ance! I found that the cream worked while in the cold dry weather we currently have, soothing the dry skin on my face. The cream left my skin feeling soft, moisturized, and fine lines around my eyes softened. My skin tone is now even, no signs of red blotchiness from the cold weather anymore! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Awesome This is truly the best cream I've ever used. Restored my skin to a youthful look. I had a few wrinkles around my mouth area, and they are gone. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Lightest, softest moisturizer Before I submit any reviews, I wanted to make sure I use this product for the certain amount of days. I really like the soft scent, texture and lighteness of the product. After two weeks my skin is smooth and soft. It quickly releaves dryness of the skin after washing my face - for us who live in the part of the world where winter is mean to our skin, this is a must have benefit when we look for a moisturizer. Overall, this Olay Total Effects 7 in one is a great product for my aging 40+ skin and going to be on my shopping list. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So simple even I can get it right Normally I have a very simple fave routine. Soap water towel and dry. But as I push closer to 35 I can see the changes in my skin. I needed to try something new. I started using the Okay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer, and my skin feels a little bit softer, my face look a little bit brighter and I'm feeling better again and I actually feel like I look closer to 25 than 35 with my skins glow. I'm really appreciative of having a chance to demo this product for free from Olay and Bzzagent for testing purposes. It's not often you get to try before you buy. It's never to late to start a beauty routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The Trial bottle lasted longer than I thought it would! I have tried the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and I would 100 recommend this product! I was totally satisfied with how it felt on my skin, no irritation or redness at all , and I have sensitive skin. I could actually feel how much more moisture was going into my skin. There was no greasy feel afterwards, in fact it absorbs very quickly and feels like you have put a great deal of the product on your skin even after only 1- 1.5 little pumps of lotion in your hands. It spreads very well and , again , I can't say enough about how smooth and soft my skin feels after I use it. The fact that it has a built in sunscreen is just a total bonus! I have a really sensitive sense of smell and perfumes make me sick so I loved the fact that it is fragrance-free . This cream makes my skin feel soft, it balances out my uneven tones and even made the bags under my eyes less visible in under a week. NO JOKE! My kids even say I look better and asked what I did different. I was unsure about the size of the trial bottle but it lasts way longer than I expected, even when using 2 pumps at a time!( but really , 1 pump was enough to cover my whole face) I sometimes use a have pump and dab my wrinkles, bags and lines you can actually see the difference in a few days. It was nice to get an anti ageing product that ACTUALLY does was it says it's supposed to do. I normally don't like to spend a great deal on face creams, but this is one I will buy regularly.

"High quality product I highly recommend this product, no matter how old you are! This is a great product to moisturize your skin without leaving a greasy or heavy feeling of your skin. I am under 30 and don't usually use anti-aging cream, so I cannot compare it to other anti-aging cream, but I like it better than my usual moisturizer. This one goes on smoothly, it looks dry and feels great on my skin. I use it morning and before bed, I feel that this product could replace all my other face product (other that makeup or makeup remover). I love it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love the way it makes your skin feel! I have used all of the Olay products! Including the make up. It is all so wonderful. It really does exactly what it says it does. Makes your skin look younger, and soft, makes fine lines disappear. I would never buy anything else!!! More expensive products don't hold a candle to the superb performance of Olay Total Effects, and yes it smells wonderful, but how it makes you look, amazing!"
"Loved the product! I loved the product and I have been very pleased with the result. It is very soft, you don't need much to cover your face, it applies easily and it gives a smooth and soft texture to the skin. I have quite sensitive skin, and it didn't cause any rash or redness, so that's a plus for me. I don't have lines and wrinkles yet, but I've seen quite a difference in the tone of my skin as it's more unified, healthy and clear. It also feels well moisterized and nourished, as if the skin has gained a little elasticity. I also like the smell. It is subtle enough, but nice. I am very pleased so far, and I would definiely continue using it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Soft As A Grape I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is probably the best moisturizer I've ever used. Right from the first application, my skin felt immediately softer and lasts all day! I've also noticed that my skin tone is a little more even and smoother, which will only get better with continued use! I've seen a little improvement on my fine lines, and I am excited to see the results in the next few weeks! My only complaint is the scent, which is a bit grandmaish, but product is also available in unscented version so problem solved :) I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for smoother, softer, more even skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smooth Skin If you are looking for a non-greasy, fast absorbing anti-aging moisturizer look no further. I have already noticed that it has helped in the reduction of visibility of my age spots which really impressed me as I am very skeptical of any product that claims that. Also it is a sulfate free formula which is another good feature as many facial products contain and if you have allergies to sulfate you break out in a rash. The Olay Total Effects does in fact even out your skin tone and the fact that it doesn't clog your pores makes it even better. Basically this product does exactly what it is supposed to do and I think it is fantastic. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer This cream sure bring back my memories of my late 20's when I started using Olay products. Thank you BzzAgent and Olay for giving me the opportunity to remember and come back to using this awesome product! I don't know why I stopped using it, but since using this cream again, I noticed the fine lines on my face is slightly blurred and more even skin tones. My pores shrink a little and I feel like it's brightening my skin a little. Once I finish this tube, I will surely go back and buy the full bottle again. Thanks again BzzAgent and Olay!!

What a difference! I love this product. My mother used to use Oil of Olay and I remember thinking it was just for old ladies....Oil of Old Age my brother and I used to joke. I consider myself young at 40 and was so surprised after using this product that my complexion has evened out and my pores are smaller. I don't wear make up so I am a fresh face kind of girl and now I feel that I look fresher and younger! The smell is light and lovely. The texture is smooth and silky- especially when applied immediately after my morning shower. It soaks in and leaves nothing but a smooth and moisturizer feel. Oil of Olay is not only for my mother anymore!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"olay total effects I love the olay 7 total effects, i really can see less lines and wrinkles. My skin is smooth and tighter and over all better looking skin. I am going to take a picture and compare it to 3 years ago from a photo i took. i have had people guess my age and they put me 10 or 20 years under what i really am. Now if that isnt reason enough to run out and give it a try, i dont know what is. Its so easy to use, i dab it on every morning, throw on my makeup and i am on my way to face the world with a better face. Excellent product. Thanks olay !

Awesome 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I have noticed a remarkable change in the age spot on my face as well as the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes. It has a mild fragrance and absorbs quickly without a greasy feeling. I love the trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer - it's a great size for those who want to try it for the first time or to take on vacation. I also need the extra moisturizer this time of year especially at work where it can be really dry. I don't find my face drying out after a 12 hour shift - it still feels wonderful and gives my skin an even tone. Thanks to Olay for the free sample and to BzzAgent for the campaign.

"Total Achievement I was very impressed with the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1. I was pleased with the light scent as it wasn't overpowering, which is a nice extra. I was also happy with the thickness of the moisturizer. It wasn't too think or thin but it was a consistency where I felt I only needed a minimal amount to properly moisturize my face effectively. I also was happy with the results of how it left my face smooth and soft and I did feel that it minimized pores. I was very happy with the moisturizer and will be looking for it at my local drug store. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love it Leaves skin beautiful. Makes face look fresh and younger looking skin
"Amazing skin to come! I seriously believe in this product. Its never too late to start taking care of your skin and it will keep you looking young for years to come. I use this product every single morning now and I couldn't be more thankful that BzzAgent selected me to try this product. I always thought my skin wasn't that bad, however, after just a couple of days of using this product I saw dramatic improvements. Even my pours appear smaller. I don't apply nearly as much of make up as I used to because my skin looks radiant now. My face definitely feels more energized since starting to use this product. I really couldn't be happier with it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So much moisture throughout the entire day! I just tried Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the first time ever and in 2 days of using it, I can already feel a difference in my skin. Alberta's winters are cold and dry, and I could feel the moisture was kept in my face all day! I love the application of the moisturizer because it goes on smooth and easily, and you only need a little squirt to cover your face and neck! My face felt mosturized right away, and it never felt greasy at all! You can definitely tell this product is high quality by the way it feels on your skin. My face feels smoother and brighter, after using the moisturizer for only 2 days! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Velvet smooth texture, velvety smooth skin Knowing how much I love Olay moisturizer and how gentle it's been on my skin (I've been using their original beauty fluid since the age of 15), I was very excited to try a FREE sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for review. With its vitamin-rich formula, Olay Total Effects purports to do the following: - Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - Evens skin tone appearance - Enhances brightness - Minimizes the look of pores - Visibly reduces age spots - Restores firmness - Replenishes moisture Upon initial use, I found the product to have a nice light scent and a smooth, velvety texture. The consistency was a little thicker than the moisturizer I normally use so I was hesitant at first to use it as my skin is easily irritated. However, I found it absorbed very well. Like any woman, I scrutinize my face on a regular basis. I noticed right away that my face felt immediately softer. While the fine lines remained after 3 weeks of use, I did notice that my skin seemed brighter within a week. I imagine if I was able to test a full-sized sample for a longer period of time, I would have noticed a bigger difference. Though not as strong as some of the more expensive products out there, this one has great value and gives you what you three or more products would give you, all in one package. Overall, a nice everyday moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Nice Its nice my skin is wonderfuland the price is good I will continue to buy this product all the time I just love it n will continue too
"moisture moisture Thank you for giving me a chance to try this product. Usually I use natural botanical skin care products that are on the higher price end due to the fact that I have very sensitive acne prone skin. However I am pleasantly surprised with this product it was very good and I really like the lite texture and mild scent. I feel like it made my skin soft and glowing and very hydrated. I like the fact that it fights 7 signs of aging all in one product which is great so that you don't have to use too many face products. Usually I would use a serum, retinol and then my moisturiser! Great product and I am a fan of this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great things come in small packages When I received my sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I was disappointed. Disappointed because the sample was so small. I felt how was I supposed to truly evaluate this tiny little bottle that will probably only last me a week. Boy was I wrong! It's been about a month now and I still have lots left, with using it daily. It only takes a little bit to make your face look and feel fantastic. My skin tone looks more even and I've definitely noticed fewer lines. I'm sold and feel guilty for doubting Olay. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Great moisturizer and anti-aging product I have used Oily of Olay facial wash and moisturizing lotion for sensitive skin for at least 20 years and now that I'm in my 40s, I wanted to add a moisturizer that would continue to provide the same results for the changes in my skin. I like that the product moisturizes well and seems to be helping and preventing the fine lines and discoloration that occurs with age. I actually have people tell me I look like I'm in my late 20s or early 30s. With compliments like that I will continue to use Oil of Olay products for life!

"Great moisturizer I have been told many times that I have a baby face. I am only 25 but many people mistake me for being 16. I don't necessarily wear moisturizer on my face (bad habit I know) but I have tried to use the Play Effects sample I received. Strangely enough people have been commenting that I look like I have been getting a lot of sleep, my face glows and my face just looks flawless. I don't wear foundation or any heavy makeup so to hear so many words of praise with such small effort has made me love this product. I acyually used the whole sample already so I can't wait to get a full size when it hits shelves next month! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The perfect face cream This was one of the best cost efficient face creams I have used. I've tried many over the years both expensive and inexpensive. This one hydrated my skin and made it appear brighter. I don't know if it was just me but I did notice fine lines becoming less noticeable. The consistency was medium, not too light and not too heavy. It went on amd felt very hydrating and did not have a heavy perfume scent. I waited until I squeezed the last little but of cream out to do my review so I could make it as honest as possible. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Nice surprise I have spent lots of money on facial moisturizers over the years hoping to find a product that I would like. Mostly the money has been wasted. I tried the play 7 in 1 moisturizer and was very pleasantly surprised. I actually seen a change! The product has great coverages and goes on light. Not heavy. After about a week I started seeing a nicer sheen to my face. I am a sceptic mainly but I have to say. I liked Olay. I found my skin firmer and just looked brighter and healthier. Would I recommend this product Absolutely! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"My experience using Olay Total Effects I tried Olay Total Effects 7 for the first time. I liked that the cream does not leave a film on the skin. The cream penetrates the skin very quickly. On the first day, I initially applied the cream before bed time. On the morning of day 2, I noticed that the skin around the eyes looked more firm and the dark circles under my eyes were less visible. On day 15 I noticed that the skin on my forehead is more firm and there are less wrinkles. I also noticed my pores are less visible. This cream is a winner and a keeper!

"Day 2 of use I just love love how smooth My face is and really don't minimize your pores smoothens oh you're fine lines and wrinkles This is one of the products that is actually telling you the truth you will not regret trying it it take years of your face it I can see the different after only 2 days useing I can just imagine how are young and refreshed I'm going to like after four weeks use in this pic it is before and after 2 days of use my face feels a lot firmer with just the right a month of moisturizer ,not greasy looling at all This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Day One of A Fresh Face I reviewed my Olay Total Effects cream today so I was super stoked to try it. Had my shower and applied it right after. I was already so impressed with its clean scent and super non oily feel. I'm normally so dry after a shower and this took the dryness away and left me feeling moisturized yet not like I'm caking on thick lotion. Having read about this prior I was so very curious about that oily feeling and I can honestly say. The claim of oil free is so true!!! I can't wait to see what the next 29 days does for my face.

"I love this moisturizer I'm really picky when it comes to face moisturizers so I didn't have high hopes for this one but I was very pleasantly surprised. My face is really dry and gets oily at the end of the day. I found that this moisturizer gave me enough moisture to not feel dry ten minutes later like most do for me. It is like a mousse, feels nice to apply and doesn't give me bumps on my face like some heavier moisturizers. I'm going to buy this from now on! I didn't notice any visible anti aging effects so I won't comment on that. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Surprising Effective Wow, I'm really impressed on how quickly this amazing lotion absorbs into your skin. I've noticed a huge difference in just 5 days. I do have really dry skin. so for me to say this is a big deal. My only suggestion is that there a recommended amount to used suggested. i.e. 1 pump or 2 pumps etc. It took me a couple of times of usage to figure it out.. The other day during a family and close friends Christmas Cookie baking day, we were talking about skin care and I mentioned how wonderful Olay Total Effects was and at least 5 people wrote it down. When something works we all share, as I'm sharing with you. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Okay total effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging. Moisturizer is amazing Since I started using Okay anti aging 7 in 1 moisturizer, I have to say my skin is starting to look and feel better. I had problems with uneven skin tone on my face, which was my main concern together with the look of my pores. The unique vitamins in this product clearly makes the appearances of my pores look better and smaller than they we're before, and my uneven skin tone is slowly going away. I thank Play for this opportunity to use this product and thanks to BzzAgents to allowing me to sample these for free. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a anti age moisturizer that works. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Deep moisturizer without a heavy feel I use the deep moisturizer mostly in the winter when my skin feels dry. It absorbs quickly and doesn't feel heavy or greasy. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Awesome!! Love it! This is the first face cream that I actually like! I was a little skeptical when I accepted this BzzKit but I am definitely one impressed lady! With other creams I tend to break out but I have not had any blemishes whatsoever while using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer! My skin is soft and glowing even in the up and down weather. I am not old enough to have signs of aging or fine lines but I hope that by using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I can delay the signs of aging.

"Just tried for the first time! So, being a woman with sensitive skin that is reactive with acne breakouts I am always worried deep down inside that new products will react badly with me. BUT, I love to try new things and so I was excited to get started! Today, I tried Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer free thanks to BzzAgent and Olay, GotItFree OlayUS after my normal cleansing routine. I pumped one pump onto my fingers, and noticed a beautiful velvety feel as I rubbed my fingers around a little. I proceeded to place the cream all over my face and instantly thought that it felt a little greasy, which made me worry. As I continued to rub it in, the greasiness quickly subsided and my skin soon began to feel soft underneath my fingers. I worried for a little after I put it on that it would start to make my face greasy and shiny later in the day, but an hour later and nothing! My skin just feels soft and beautiful and I find myself having to stop myself from touching it because it's SO soft! I have a problem sometimes with new products and the overwhelming smell of perfume, but I loved the gentle, clean smell of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer! I would recommend this to everyone, especially to people with sensitive skin aand who are sensitive to perfume! I'm so happy to have been able to try this for free from Olay and BzzAgent!

Though it says 4 weeks an you look 10 years younger, Ive only tried it for 2 weeks. What a great moisturizer! A little goes a long way for sure. It' s rich in texture, goes on like a dream. There is no greasy feeling on my face after applying it, no waiting for it to dry. As a matter of fact, it doesn't even feel like I put anything on, that's how light it is. I've noticed that the little lines around my eyes and mouth have lessened and that's awesome. I will definitely recommend this product :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Fixed my issues! Finally, an anti-aging cream that doesn't leave my skin feeling creamy, pasty or sticky! Olay's Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer has a slight scent, but is tolerable through out the day. This cream did not dry-out my skin, and left my dry skin feeling refreshed at the end of the day. Also, my pores have less blackheads since I first started using the product, and my deep wrinkles are seamless. It does not cause acne, as I'm acne-prone and haven't had a zit since! I used the moisturizer in the day and at night and I have had no issue with it. I am very happy to have tried this product and I will buy it once the sample is over.

"Fantastic youth in a bottle Olay moisturizer Day one.. Upon application my skin feels silky soft and hydrated. Normally i have extremely dry flaky skin so the extra boost of hydration is a must. I also notice that is has more of a smooth texture and not greasy on my skin type. Day two.. Dry patches are becoming less flaky. Skin feels soft and smooth to the touch also there is no noticeable blemishes forming. Dont notice any difference with wrinkles or age/sun spots but its still early Day 3.. Dry patches visibly reduced. Make up goes on much smoother and my skin feels plumped up and hydrated. It doesn't break down under makeup or cause greasyness. So far no blemishes either. Day 4-5. Skin feels so smooth, makeup gliding on like a dream, how ever my water based foundation doesn't combine well. So I've been using a less favorable foundation. Not noticing any difference in lines or pigmentation/sun spots but still hopeful. Day 6-7. Noticing a few very dark black heads, but no white heads. Skin is still feeling smooth.. Nearly all dry patches are gone. Skin is feeling plumper and so soft. 8-14. Slight fading of age spots, noticeable plumping and smoothness of skin. I can see with continued use that my skin could look like it did as a teen.. Im very impressed with this product and would refer it to anyone Sample size not large enough to test for 4 full weeks.

"Olay Total Effects 7 I just love the Olay Total Effects 7, it definitely lives up to it's advertisements about your skin looking 10 years younger in just 4 weeks. I normally use the Olay moisturizer and thought it was the best product on the market for me but because I am now 52 I needed something different, I tried the Total Effects and my wrinkles are less visible and my age spots are lighter, my skin hasn't been this soft and smooth in years. I have and will definitely be recommending it to all my friends and have since the trial bought a full size bottle. Thank you Olay !! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love Olay moisturizer I was excited to get to try out this Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer! I have been using Olay products for a while but to get to try out the trial size of this product was so awesome. The trial size will be available in stores in Feb but the full size version is available now. This product uses a unique vitamin complex which helps fight the seven signs of aging (and we all see these as we get older) - fine lines, ages spots and uneven skin tone, etc. I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks now and have seen big improvements in my skin. I will continue to use this all year long! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Younger, healthier-looking skin! I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer for a few weeks now, and my skin looks and feels amazing. I have just run out of my sample size, and will be purchasing a full size product this week. I have gotten a lot of compliments on my skin since I started using this product, and have been really happy with how fresh and pretty my makeup has looked when I have applied it over top of this moisturizer. It's not a super heavy cream like many other anti-aging products I have tried, nor is it ridiculously expensive. Best of all, it actually delivers noticeable results, which is why I will be purchasing it again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This product gives truth to promises This product did everything and more then it promised. First of all I have very sensitive skin and I did not break out at all from it. A little goes a long way. I would use it at night and just overnight this product showed visible results. My skin felt younger, and stronger in one use. My skin is usually dry and I get spots from it, but after using this product for four weeks all of that has disappeared. My skin looks youthful, firm and fresh. The dark spots have faded and I feel younger. I will recommend this to my friends and family for sure! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Moisturizer not makeup! I have never been one to religiously use a facial moisturizer, but since using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I am sold. It is a very light, non-greasy moisturizer that goes on super smooth. It has done wonders for evening out my skin tone, to the point that I am not even using a foundation or powder anymore .... moisturizer, a little mascara and I am out the door in the morning! How wonderfully freeing!! I am completely hooked and there will definitely be a follow up purchase. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream I've been using for over 3 years now. I am 72 yrs. old I've been told more told more than once, I don't look a day over 60. A compliment like goes along way. Thank you for a great product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Amazing anti-aging moisturizer -Olay I have tried the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti- Aging Moisturizer and love it! I think I'm hooked now. The smell is amazing, first off. But the moisturizser goes on smooth, not greasy at all, and you don't need very much. Right away you can feel that it firms your face, but in a good way. I had a few crows feet that seemed to be lessened by this product, even though I didnt mind having them in the first place. It did seem to help with uneven tone, and gave me a more blended look, without the use of foundation. Love this product, and will be buying it in the future. Worth spending the money on.

Olay Total Effects I have been using Olay Total Effects now for appropriately 2 weeks and I would definitely recommend trying this product. I have noticed that the redness of my skin is greatly reduced and that it feels smoother and much more moisturized than before. I feel like I look younger in the appearance of my skin. My fiance even noticed a difference. The only drawback for me is that the one I tried contained fragrance so I will be purchasing the unscented version for myself. Although it wasn't an overpowering scent. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
All in One Makes it Easy My first impression was that I was to young to use this but I was really surprised how good my skin has been feeling. You only need a small amount and I use it every other day. It absorbed fast and wasnt greasy. Five minutes later I was able to apply my foundation. I didn't think my skin was mature until I tried this. I'm 30 and my skin is changing. I feel brighter and my face feels very soft. I would consider spending money to keep using it. I've replaced all my skin care products for this one bottle. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"LIKED IT!!! Well it has been some time that I have been using this product and I am very happy with the results. My skin is usually dull and just drab looking, but after using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Agining Moisturizer for a few weeks, my skin has really come around. It is a lot brighter, and has a shine to it (a good shine). I also noticed that the skin around my eyes is looking more awake and the dark circles have improved. I am truely enjoying this product and would definitely recommend to others! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I was skeptical... I absolutely love this moisturizer. I have combination skin that tends to be very oily in some areas and extremely dry and flakey in others. This product smooths out my skin leaving it feeling so soft, helps with my dry spots and isn't the least bit oily. My sample really isn't that big so I'm planning on going to buy the full size product so I can get more use out of it! So so happy I was picked for this campaign, I have such a hard time finding a good face cream and this is one of the best I've tried. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Oil of Olay Anti-aging This is an amazing moisturizer if you are looking for something with anti-aging properties but for just a fraction of the cost of some of the ones on the market! Within weeks I noticed a more balanced and even skin tone and complexion. I also noted a reasonable improvement in the fine lines surrounding my eyes. And it is not too oily like many products I have tried previously. This one ranks high on my list!! I would highly recommend this effective AND affordable moisturizer to anyone I know.

"Olay Total Effect 7in1 Love this moisturizer, my skin feels great. Just applied it again and I have such a beautiful glow. My skin looks younger and more youthful. The consistency of the moisturizer is rich and then feels very light on your skin. I wear foundation over top and it still feels great, not cakey. The before and after effects is astonishing!! Everyone concerned with wrinkles and dark spots needs to go get the Olay Total Effect 7in1 moisturizer, you wont believe the difference it has on your appearance. Truly amazing, thank you Bzz Agent and Olay for letting my try it for free!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Very pleased I was pleased with the Olay Total Effects moisturizer the second I put a drop on my finger. It went on smoothly, it smelled great and it didn't leave any greasy feeling on my face. My face continued to feel moisturized long after other creams would have faded away. OTE appears to have reduced the look of the finer wrinkles on my face and I'm sure as I continue to use it, that benefit will be even more evident. I am keeping an eye on an age spot that I have, hoping to see it fade as well. Overall, this is a great product that I am very happy to have had the opportunity to try. I highly recommend it to others looking for a great new moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Moisterizing at it's finest! My first reaction to the packaging was HOW CUTE!! Such a great idea making a trial sized version of this cream! So compact and small enough to carry in my purse! Olay total Effects 7 in 1 Anti aging Moisturizer is a brilliant product! Perfect amount in one pump. You only need max three pumps to cover your face and targets every problem zone! I have lines and uneven skin tone and within using it for almost three weeks I have already seen a great improvement! Smoother lines, not so visible and age spots much lighter than they were three weeks ago! On top of that, left my skin feeling perfectly moisturized without the oily residue! Love this product!

"Best anti aging moisturizer, 7 in 1 by Olay I've been using Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer for almost a month now and I am very pleased. I don't usually enjoy wearing moisturizer because of the way it leaves my skin but this one I can put under my makeup without the greesy feeling. It has left my skin super soft and tighter feeling, along with really helping minimizing the pores on my face, especially on my nose! I would really recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great moisturizer and anti aging cream at rhe same time, will definitely be buying more when my sample runs out. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This product is Luxury at it's finest I Love using Olay's Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating cream!!! This luxurious cream does what it states. My skin is well hydrated, not greasy or dry. I love that my skin looks and feels softer and smoother, and because of the hydration it looks so supple. My skin has been truly rejuvenated, Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream does not irritate my skin, over dry, or make my skin look dull. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Evened my skin I have been using this regularly since I've received it in the mail. I really loved how gentle the formula was and that it worked great in place of my moisturizer. I have pretty sensitive skin especially around my nose and eyes and this product did not irritate my skin at all. After a few weeks of use I've noticed my skin seems more even toned. I had a few dark spots from old blemishes and this has improved the look of them dramatically. For this reason I would recommend it to a friend! I love olay and with continued use I hope to see a reduction of fine lines, right now I think I haven't been using it long enough to notice a difference for lines.

Olay makes skin so soft.. Olay makes my skin so soft and refreshing. The smell is amazing. My skin feels so soft.
"Great Olay product,as always I loved having the opportunity to try the sample size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I have always loved Olay products,so had high hopes of this one as well,and I was not let down. I have noticed after using this for a few weeks now,that my face has gotten a lot smoother and softer. It has a nice glow to it. I havent noticed any differences in anti-aging,but I do not have that many fine lines to begin with. My skin do look more even though and healthier. I love it,and would recommend it to anyone to try. I plan on continuing to use it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I need more... love this facial cream! I can't seem to get enough. I am truly enjoying the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. This cream doesn't leave my face feeling oily, but also leaves me completely moisturized all day long. Especially nice in our harsh Canadian winters. Loving that there is little to no fragrance. I have noticed a difference in my complexion since I have began using this. My face seems more clear and defined. At 37 years old with the onset of age spots appearing, I'm willing to try anything to help and believe I have found my go to facial cream. I am in love! Who doesn't want to look younger! Trust me, you won't be disappointed, try it today! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great product After using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer , I found my skin to be well hydrated and comfortable. Winter in Canada is hard on my skin but while using this product my skin did not feel tight, skin tone was evened out, and there were no dry patches, skin felt smooth and clean. Overall I believe this product to do what it claims to to some degree. Everyone has different skin and different degrees of issues but I think by using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer people will find it will address at least some, if not all, of their skin issues. thanks Bzzagent for letting me try and i give the product 5 stars This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Product I think this is so amazing I love how it is helping my skin and helping to get rid of fine lines and wrinkles and age spots. I love how easy it goes on and its so simple to use and leaves my skin feeling amazing and smooth. I like knowing that im doing something good for my skin and also helping make my skin look great at the same time. I never believed that there was a product out there that has 7 in 1 this is great, it is an anti-aging moisturizer and it has a unique vitamin complex it , that helps out with signs of aging and fine lines wrinkles and uneven skin tone this is just the best., This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I not only LOVE this, I have already purchsed the product again ! I stopped using Olay years ago from a bad experience and I found it smelled strong - in recent years I have wanted to try again but haven't until now because BzzAgent launched a campaign that provided those blessed to review with a sample size of Olay total effects. I must say I LOVE this product so much so, that I finished the 15ml trial and already have purchased the 50ml bottle. It has no strong smell is not think, it absorbs fast and although your face feel better, softer and nourished, you can't feel the product - all huge for me. I would like to add that I do not use the one with the SPF in the past, I tend to break out using anything where SPF is included. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
I am a true believer now! Well after almost 50 days I am a total believer in the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It smells wonderful my skin has never felt better and the glow my face has now is unbelievable. I get stopped by strangers now and ask what my secret is to my skin. I have replied MY Olay. My grandmother has been saying for years 'You must use Olay!I would just laugh. Well the last laugh is on me. This is not just your grandmothers cream anymore! My pores look better and I feel refreshed every time I use it. It has turned into the only thing I use now. I recommend it to all my friends and family and any stranger that stops me to ask What's your secret This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Feels great on my face I like how it makes my face feel every time I put it on.
Great product I've been using Olay Total Effects for about 4 weeks and must say I'm very impressed. It's not only moisturizers my skin but also evens my skin tone and smoothes wrinkles and lines. I was lucky and experienced the cream not only in cold and dry Canadian environment but also in hot tropical as we are vacationing in Mexico. The result was the same great. The cream did not make my skin oily and greasy but instead it moisturized and replenished my sun touched dry skin and even soothed it when I needed it. Overall I love Olay total effects and would definitely continue using it upon arrival back to Canada. Thanks Bzzagent for helping to discover a new product I love.

"Dry Skin This product is great for your skin if you have dry skin, your skin feels so refresh and I feel so alive after I put this product on my face, it like new born skin, so soft and I feel protected for the sun. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"New Loyal Customer This product is exceeding my expectations! I have never had a daily skin care routine, but having hit my 33rd year and two kids later, I could not help but notice the lines that were around my eyes and plaguing my forehead. My skin over the last year has dulled and felt dry (a problem I'd never had being the oily skin zone gal). With only 1 use, I noticed the lines fading. Now less than a week into daily treatments, I've taken at least 5 years off, the lines have faded to almost gone and my skin texture and color has improved dramatically. I'm sold for life! The only thing I'd add is a bit more SPF in the moisturizer, but I can always add more myself :)."
"Absolutely Love Before I spent money on this product I would really like to know that it does not clog my pores and break me out, that it would not feel greasy or heavy, and that it hit most, if not all, of the claims on the package. Olay Total Effect 7 in One was a dream on my skin almost instantly. There was a softness I haven't felt before, redness around my cheek and nose faded, my skin tone evened out, and my pores seemed much smaller and smoother. I put this on before foundation every single day and it's a fantastic base in that process. I have about one weeks worth left of my trial and assuming that I remain break-out free, I will absolutely be purchasing this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer Olay has always been my one go to brand for moisturizing, since my early 20s. I've been using this particular moisturizer for about a week on my face and neck one pump for the day and one for the night. I have combination dry/oily skin. My skin looks brighter, more hydrated, and feels (and looks) much smoother, without feeling greasy. Even my under eye area has lightened and looks less puffy! The fact that its fragrance-free is a plus due to sensitivities, Im not allowed to wear products with fragrance in the office. Love this moisturizer for my dry, winter skin. Two pumps a day, infused with vitamins, and antioxidants, is all I need! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Boo hoo, my trial is all gone! It took me 3 and a half weeks to use up my trial! My skin was so smooth and soft, and the tone more even and brighter. My few fine lines beside my eyes were reduced, but I think more time would be needed to see the full effects. Over the holidays I showed off my trial bottle (and my face!) to friends and family. Everyone seemed positive about it, except for speculating how much it might cost to buy....! My mom and sisters commented on the delicate scent and nice consistency of the lotion (yes I even shared a few drops!). It has been a week that I have been without, now, and I am missing my Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 Now that i have been using Olay Total Effects 7 for one month i just need to let anyone know who is looking for a new and better product that this is it. One big complaint that i had about my skin that as i got older my skin was dull, well it is dull no more, my complextion is brighter and has more color after using Olay Total Effects 7 for 1 month, i love it and have already purchased a new bottle so i don't run out. I purchased the no fragrance bottle as i prefer the no fragrance type. I simply love this product and it is all i will use from here on in. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Pleasantly surprised. i have combination ski, live on well water that drys out my skin, and it's winter here in BC, Canada. My poor skin has it rough! I was skeptical that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer would help my poor dry skin, but thankfully I was wrong. First off I liked the fragrance. It's subtle enough that's it's not overwhelming. Secondly, my skin loved it. I was worried it would be too heavy, and make my skin oily and prone to break outs, but that's not the case. My skin was left soft and smooth, and it didn't leave any greasy residue behind. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has replaced my last moisturizer for good. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
At age 52 I pass for 32. I especially love the serum. It just soaks right in and my skin feels youthful and dewy.
"In Love with this!! I have always enjoyed any Oil of Olay products I have tried, but this Olay Total Effects 7 in ! Anti-Aging Moisturizer has me blown away! My skin is very sensitive and breaks out very, very easily .. Yes - even at my age of 42 :-( I tried this and I have noticed more even skin tone, which I am loving and my fine lines are disappearing. Its like I'm turning back time, must be the unique vitamin complex that is in the moisturizer. I'm enjoying the results so much I'm buying one for my mom and my aunt, I love them and want them to experience more beautiful skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love the feel of my skin Years ago I remember my mother using Oil of Olay. I remember the smell of it distinctly. As soon as I opened up my box of Olay total Effects I realized this wasn't my mothers Oil of Olay. Once I placed it on my skin for the first time and noticed how nice it felt and how it moisturized my skin that I would be hooked. I have used it daily since I received it and recently finished off the bottle and ran out that day to get myself a new bottle. My skin looks great, my dark spots seem to be smoothing out and I am now an official Olay user just like my mother. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Olay Total Effects 7 in one I had been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in one that I had received from buzzagent since about three weeks. I am in love with it!! I dont have wrinkles or lines yet and I don't think I will get them any sooner, thanks to this anti aging moisturizer. Im 30 years old and i have 3 kids people that see me think that im only 20-22 years old. My mother always said that a woman should start using anti aging products when she hits the age of 30. I was in search for an anti aging product. Ifeel that my face is firmer and i feel that my face has a glow to it. I am very happy with this product and thanks to BuzzAgent i found what i was looking for. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Soft younger looking skin I have used other Olay moisturizers in the past, and have been happy with them. I like that the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has no scent, no sensitivity and that it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. I have noticed a small difference in the fine lines around my eyes, and don't have any new wrinkles, which is truly a bonus! I don't have an uneven skin tone, so I can't comment on that. My skin was definitely hydrated, looked firmer and smooth. Their unique vitamin complex can be found in a single bottle! I have received numerous compliments on how young my skin looks, and of course I will attribute that to Olay! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects Rocks I have been using the Olay Total Effects for 2 weeks and have noticed some positive changes to my face.I think Olay Total Effects has been the ultimate cream that I used. My lines are less noticeable, and my skin looks and feels less dry. My pores I have not notice a big chance but hopefully in time and using it ,there will be. My chin and cheeks feels firmer and a slight glow has appeared. Having sensitive skin is no picnic, and so far no outbreaks or rash. I like the thought that their is a vitamin complex added to fight the seven signs of aging.I recommend it for women that wants their face to look and feel younger . I will definitely will be purchasing it in the near future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Amazing product! This stuff is amazing. It's a cult fav. I know of this moisturizer because my mom uses it all the time. She is well in her 60's and gets compliments about her skin every time she is in public. I been using this for only a year, but since then my skin texture was transformed. I use to have many dry patches, and dark spots. I'm 34 but skincare is extremely important to me. I'm very picky when it comes to skin care products. I work all night so I need a moisturizer that will also help with dullness and making it look energized and beautiful. Olay is the only drugstore brand I find that actually works and is worth buying. I deff recommend this moisturizer. A lot of my friends use it now. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
love the feeling I have used it three times now and my skin feels so smooth i love it im still waiting to see the different in skin tone change but im going to keep trying it to see where it takes my akin but im loving it so gat and think its a great product to try... i even went to the store to see it and i thought it would jave been a good idea they have for sale a smaller bottle so thay people could try it out kust like us special bzz agents then theu could see the results it gives and then commit to the bigger bottle!!! But i personally being able to try the sample love it so gar and would probably buy the bigger bottle once done if the results continue this way This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"WOW, what a difference! I cannot believe after only using Olay Total Effects 7 for only 14 days how my face feels and looks! I have been using the same moisturizer since high school (now I am 35) as I am afraid to change and end up with break outs! But I am happy I received the sample to try..Now I will be purchasing this product to use daily. My sister tried my sample just the once and she could not believe how soft her face felt. We heat with wood heat and with wood heat comes the DRYNESS of your skin, but my face has been good so far since trying the sample. Does not feel tight, no dryness and crazy soft. Def an amazing product This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay you got it right for me! I received a sample of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and have been using it for about a week. I love that it is unscented, non-greasy and absorbs right in my skin. These are the most important factors to me when choosing a moisturizer and Olay got them all right for me, hurray! I also like the consistency of the moisturizer and it spreads so well that I found I need less than a pea size for my whole face. I found that the pump dispenses much more than I need and I have to always remember to press the pump very lightly. I'm going to share the sample with my husband as he has more skin issues than me :) and I will report back how the moisturizer works for him. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
keeps face looking young great value four money keeps your face looking young
My skin feels silky after I put it on. I've seen a difference n feel a difference since using Olay! I love this product n it's smell.
Great moisturizer for oily skin This is an amazing moisturizer for people with oily skin like me! It goes on super smooth and absorbs really fast! It feels so great. I have always heard great things about Olay but had never tried it before I'll be 30 soon and the fine lines will be sure to follow . This is something I would consider using to prevent aging skin. It is also something I think my mother will like. The only downside to this was the scent I found it quite strong but luckily it comes in a fragrance free format as well which is great news for me and also my mother as we are sensitive to fragrances.

years of experience Olay is a tried and true product. My mother used these products . When wrinkles started my first thoughts were to buy some Olay. I love the products just as much as my mother liked them. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"AMAZING Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer Since I started using my trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer that I received free from BzzAgent my skin has literally transformed! After the first day I already noticed that my skin had developed a beautiful, healthy, natural glow. The unique vitamin complex has helped to fight the signs of fine lines and has immensely evened out my skin tone. I've actually had compliments about how bright and beautiful my skins been looking since I first tried the product. It goes on the skin like a dream and leaves no greasiness. It makes your skin feel healthy and supple. A beautiful product that I will definitely be purchasing again and again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Loved the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 moisturizer This great bzz offer came at the perfect time as I was looking for a new moisturizer! I tried the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and I noticed a difference right away! I noticed my skin tone was even and my pores were smaller! I also felt my face was not dry and felt like it had just the right amount of moisture! I was also very excited to see that my age spots seemed less noticeable! I was so happy with this product that I went out and bought both the face wash with the matching olya effects 7 in 1 moisturizer. I found a great deal with the gift sets that were available during the Christmas season. I highly recommend this product! :) This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great moisturizer Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer has been a good product for me. It made my face really smooth. The pump packaging is great because it delivers just the right amount, in addition, it is much superior compared to the jar design. The pump packaging makes sure all the active ingredients stay active. I can't say it got rid of any deep wrinkles, but it did make my face smooth. For people who don't like any fragrance, you would have to stay away, because this moisturizer does smell good/perfumed. The texture is also really easy to put on, a little goes a long way.

glowy skin! Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is awesome! I have loved using this product and have even gone out and bought a full size bottle. I noticed a change in my skin tine in that it looked brighter and more clear. I even had some people comment on how glowy my skin looked. I also noticed that my skin was moisturized and it felt great to the touch as well as it didnt feel tight or dry like it sometimes gets in the winter. Having said that I also found that it was nice and light unlike some moisturizers I have used in the past in winter. I'm in love and will keep using this product!

"Love the non-greasy formula I am a strong believer in using anti-aging products and I haven't really hit the space where I have seen a lot of fine lines - yay for genetics and a head start on an anti-aging regime. I can't say for certain if the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is producing visible results, but I do like that it is at minimum keeping things status quo. What I really like about this is that it is a non-greasy formula that sinks into my skin quickly. My skin stayed hydrated throughout the day even in a dry cold climate and my skin tone seem to be more even. I would recommend the Olay Total Effects for anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced anti-aging moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Will never use another moisturizer I have been using this for years and absolutely love it. It makes my skin feel perfectly hydrated and soft. I use it 2 to 4 times a day and I don't ever plan on using anything else! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Amazing difference I have been using the same product on my face for years now. Why fix what isn't broken right Well sometimes you need to try a new product to show you that things aren't as good as they seem! I have had bumpy skin on my face for a long time but never thought it had anything to do with the moisturizer I was using! Since receiving this sample and using it for the last 5 days now my skin has never felt so good. The little bumps are almost gone, my skin doesn't feel right at all anymore throughout the day, my skin tone is becoming more even! While this definitely costs more than the product that I've been using I certainly don't feel like I've been doing myself any favours! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Forgot how much I love this product! I received this sample a while back from BzzAgent and Olay. The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer sure did bring back my memories of my earlier days. I forgot how good this moisturizer feels on my skin! The cream is just like I remembered it to be, gentle on the face, evened out my skin tone, smoothed out the fine wrinkles around my eyes, brightened, and moisturized. With the added sun screen, you can't go wrong! I am now wondering as to why I steered away from this cream and am coming back to it for good! Thank you BzzAgent and Olay for reminding me on how much I love this cream!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is Amazing! I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is an amazing skin care product! I've been using it for just over 5 weeks and have seen a difference in the way my skin looks and feels. My skin looks more smooth and radiant. Fine lines are less noticeable! Normally I have dry flaky skin, but since I started using this product, I haven't had that problem :) The best part about using this product is that I had a friend comment on my skin yesterday. She asked what I've been doing different because my skin looked so nice. Clearly it must be working....to get a comment like that one! I know there are a lot of products out there, but this one works great for me! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"another great product from Olay I have often used Oil of Olay products for the past 25 years (I am in my 40's now). This one is easily one of the best. We don't have the nicest of winters here on the East Coast of Canada and a good moisturizer is a must have. This one checked all the boxes of what I am looking for. It is light and velvety, moisturizes fast and not greasy and was unscented. It has become part of my morning ritual and the best part is that it absorbs much faster than many moisturizers so I can apply makeup immediately. I love it! Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 lives up to its claims. after several weeks my skin looks and feels great. I am going out to buy a full sized bottle and maybe one or two more for presents. 5 out of 5 from me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Works Amazingly Well! I have been very pleased with the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. First off the packaging is really great. I always like when moisturizers come in a pump format as it more hygienic. The pump works smoothly without squeezing out too much, getting clogged or spilling over. The product has a very mild scent which is great if you have a sensitivity. It spreads really easily and smoothly over the skin. It is super hydrating but not tacky or sticky. It sinks in quickly and leaves a smooth velvety finish on the skin. I noticed that during these cold months my skin tends to get flaky and this moisturizer got rid of the flakes for me. It also helped to smooth out the fine lines under and around my eyes. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Saved my Skin Total Effects Daily Moisturizer truly saved my skin when I was visiting Italy last spring. After a few days of prolonged exposure to the elements while sight-seeing I returned to the hotel with very irritated skin. The hotel didnt provide body lotion and I only had 2 small sample tubes of Total Effects products. I liberally applied the Daily Moisturizer before bed. My face felt so much better the next morning and I continued to use it, making sure it would last for the rest of my trip. Now I always rely on Total Effects when I need a very moisturizing, soothing face cream, especially when I will be out in the weather or traveling."
"Skin thanked me for it. Even though it isn't that cold yet my skin still needs a daily moisturizer. Because I am over 40 I have noticed a difference in my skin. But this Olay Total Effects moisturizer was great. The feel of it on my skin was silky and refreshing. I did notice my skin tone is evenning out. I'm not sure about age spots yet but I was trying to pay attention to the fine lines that are around my eyes and without taking a picture everyday I really can't say that it made them disappear but I can say that they did not get worse or more pronounced. My skin has always liked the Olay line of products. Overall I would have to say that it feels great when I put it on, silky, smooth, refreshing, and my skin thanks me for it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay is the best! I have always liked Olay products but when it came to the facial moisturizers I wasn't always a fan. I felt they were either too thick or too light. This product has the right balance for my skin. I am not convinced its thick enough for the winter months, as this past week I feel my skin is not getting enough moisture. So I was thinking of trying another application at night before bed. I feel my skin is much softer and I have noticed my pores have minimized in size. I haven't noticed any reduction in fine lines but maybe I need to use it longer. Overall I am quite happy with this product and I would certainly suggest to my friends. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not a fountain of youth, but pretty good anyway! After four weeks of daily usage, I have to say that while it did not make me 10 years younger, my skin does appear much healthier. First, this moisturizer is gentle and leaves my skin feeling clean, not oily at all. It smells pretty nice and one pump goes a long way. The cream seems to get absorbed very easily into my skin, leaving behind softer and glowing skin. So it does fulfil many of its claims such as evening skin tone, enhancing brightness, restores some firmness and moisture. However, despite all of this, I don't think I saw a visible reduction in fine lines, age spots, or minimization of my pores. So overall, I think its great as a light moisturizer, but I haven't noticed any dramatic changes. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love, love, love!!! I LOVE this product, I have never used any anti-aging products before, but Olay of Oil has changed my mind! I 100 notice a difference with my face. My pores look smaller, the lines on my forehead look diminished and the bags under my eyes are almost non-existent! This product also leaves my skin feeling so hydrated, I used to have to apply lotion a few times a day as my skin can get dryer in the colder months, but I use 1 little dab every morning and I am good for the entire day! I could not be happier and I will continue to use this product as part of my daily routine from now on as well as recommend it to all of my girlfriends!

Regenerist Deep Hydration Rgenerating Cream I have been using this product for a number of years. I have tried other products but always come back to this for its results! Keeps my skin hydrated. Use it for night and day moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Wow, wish i used ealier! I was nervous to use this product during the Christmas holidays as my face is very sensitive and can breakout easily to new products, hence why my review is a bit late. I wish I would have used it earlier because my skin looks and feels amazing, with no breakouts in sight! It made my skin noticeably smoother, pores smaller(which is amazing) and there is an incredible healthy glow to it after first use. I will defiantly repurchase this product but I think I will see if there is a fragrance free version. I love Olay products. You can see and feel the quality of their products from the results in your skin, and this one is no exception! Thanks so much for giving me the opportunity to try it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Remarkable! I've tried a lot of anti-aging products and this is by far the best. It absorbs readily into the skin and doesn't leave a greasy feeling. I have noticed a reduction in the appearance of fine lines. The age spots don't appear to have changed much nor the uneven skin tone, however, I'm confident with regular use these will diminish with time. I wish this product was around 10 years ago. Even if it doesn't improve the age spots, etc., it is a very good moisturizer. My skin has never felt this soft. Whilst we don't know the exact cost, as with most Olay products, price has never been an issue. All in all though I'm very happy with this product and you should be too, you have nothing to lose!

even skin tone I LOVE theOlay 7 in 1 anti aging moisurizer. I have only been using it for 10 days and can see a difference in the brightness and evenness of my skin tone. I have always been a faithful moisturizier user was was pleasantly surprised at the difference this product has made my skin. I love how the unique vitamin mix seems to give my skin the radiance I deserve and have always wanted. I feel this formula will help my skin with all the signs of aging and I want to do as much prevention and good for my skin that I can. I will definitely buy this products and tell all my girlfriends. When the group of girls were over the other night we had a test of how the product felt and they all loved it. Thanks This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Amazing product Olay moisturizer Day one.. Upon application my skin feels silky soft and hydrated. Normally i have extremely dry flaky skin so the extra boost of hydration is a must. I also notice that is has more of a smooth texture and not greasy on my skin type. Day two.. Dry patches are becoming less flaky. Skin feels soft and smooth to the touch also there is no noticeable blemishes forming. Dont notice any difference with wrinkles or age/sun spots but its still early Day 3.. Dry patches visibly reduced. Make up goes on much smoother and my skin feels plumped up and hydrated. It doesn't break down under makeup or cause greasyness. So far no blemishes either. Day 4-5. Skin feels so smooth, makeup gliding on like a dream, how ever my water based foundation doesn't combine well. So I've been using a less favorable foundation. Not noticing any difference in lines or pigmentation/sun spots but still hopeful. Day 6-7. Noticing a few very dark black heads, but no white heads. Skin is still feeling smooth.. Nearly all dry patches are gone. Skin is feeling plumper and so soft. 8-14. Slight fading of age spots, noticeable plumping and smoothness of skin. I can see with continued use that my skin could look like it did as a teen.. Im very impressed with this product and would refer it to anyone This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"New Olay moisturizer is great! I recently tried the new Olay moisturizer and I'm quite pleased with it so far. It absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn't create a film of grease , my skin is normally sensitive and I'm prone to break outs whenever I try new moisturizers but so far after nearly two weeks of using the product my skin has not been negatively affected . I think my skin looks more even and feels softer. It's winter so normally my skin can get dry but I feel this product has kept my skin from drying out . I'm also interested in testing out other products from this line. Overall , I find it lightweight , not heavily scented and the quick absorption into my skin are all important to me when using a moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"All I have to say is wow. All I have to say is WOW. I received a free trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer from Buzzagent. I currently use Olay Regenerist and like my skin. However, after doing the trial I love my skin. It looks so great. I have dry, dehydrated facial skin and I need a rich moisturizer. This product fills that need. The product sinks into my skin when I apply it and it is silky smooth and not greasy. Foundation slides right on after I moisturize. Even my sensitive skin did not get irritated or red. This product claims to do 7 things: 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles 2. Evens skin tone appearance 3. Enhances brightness 4. Minimizes the look of pores 5. Visibly reduces age spots 6. Restores firmness 7. Replenishes moisture The fine lines in the corners by my mouth has disappeared. My skin tone which was relatively even before looks better. My skin is brighter and it glows. No longer seeing large pores on my nose. I had no age spots to be reduce. My face seems firmer and my dehydrated skin is well moisturized. This product is not a hoax, it works. I highly recommend this product. I will be definitely be buying this product when my free product is finished. GotItFree OlayTotalEffects7X Olay This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Vivian10973 Right from the first time I applied Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, my skin was so soft...it felt like silk!! Within a couple of days, I did notice those fine, little lines around my eyes lessen and within a week almost totally erased. My skin tone improved giving me an even, brighter tone throughout my face...lightening the circles under my eyes. My cheeks and mouth area also have reduced wrinkles and are noticeably firmer. I love the light, fresh scent not overpowering and impressed how fast-absorbing it is. The pores on my nose seems like they're almost gone....they've decreased in size and never got clogged. Truly a wonderful product that tackles many little problems all in one cream. My skin has never felt or looked so good!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This Product Has a Wonderful Fragrance The Texture and smell is Beautifully blended and makes skin very soft.
"Oops you did it again! Olay, you did it again! The 7 in 1 Anti- Aging Moisturizer far exceeded my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone! Immediately after the first application I noticed how soft it made my skin feel. Unfortunately I was blessed with large pores and very uneven skin tone and only two weeks in I can see a HUGE difference and improvement in both areas. The unique vitamin complex helps to fight all of the 7 signs of aging. It will smooth those fine lines, help correct uneven skin tone and age spots, and leave your skin feeling smoother than ever. With Christmas right around the corner, Olays 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Mousturizer is definitely at the top of my Wish List this year. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects First Thoughts So I have used Olay Total Effects in the past as my main moisturizer for years, but a few years ago I upgraded to Olay Regenerist as I am getting a bit older. So I was excited to try it again and am happy to report that it works just as well as it used to. As a day time moisturizer it is perfect, not too greasy or oily, doesn't make my skin too dry, has a very pleasant scent. All things I love in a moisturizer. Although I still like my Regenerist as my go to daily moisturizer I am not oppose to using Total Effects, or any other moisturizer that Olay makes. I am a fan of the brand and have been for years and would recommend the brand to anyone just starting out with a daily moisturizer especially Total Effects as it served me well for years :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Excellent Product! Since using Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream my skin feels great! I am glowing and I look younger. This product has made my forehead wrinkles almost disappear! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"What a surprise! Olay Total Effects 7-1 anti-aging moisturizer was light on my skin not greasy nor did it have a heaviness that a lot of other creams have. My complexion was brighter not dull, the results were very noticeable and quickly too. The lines around my eyes were smoother than before and the pump was excellent not fussy easy to use. I would recommend this cream for every skin type, there was no breakouts just wonderful to use. A couple of my friends tried this product and told me they liked the pump style, it stayed fresher because it meant not so many germs as with creams with lids. They loved the texture of the cream which wasnt greasy, sticky or made their skin shiny. It minimizing pores and had the added bonus of SPF which we all need.

I have always been a fan of Olay -- they have been around forever!! I love that this product does so many things! I mean, let's be realistic, who has the time and money to buy 7 different products, and apply them faithfully every day. I know that does not describe me. I am lazy! The fact that this product tackles 7 issues in one blow makes me very happy! And who doesn't want to take 10 years off their age. I do!

"Buh-bye dark spots! I've only been using this for a week, and noticed a difference in one of dark spots within four days. FOUR DAYS!"
"So far...WOW I had never used this product before - I had seen it on the shelves at the drug store, and know that Olay is an excellent project, but honestly the price point was an issue for me. I think I might be changing my tune. I have only been using it for a week and so far am over the moon with the product. I know that they say 4 weeks to notice a difference but as far as the smoothness of my skin I have already noticed a difference. I have very sensitive skin and so far have had no issues. There is no overwhelming odor and it goes on feeling lovely with no greasy feeling after. Since using the sample I have ceased using anything else as far as moisturizer. I love it and will DEFINITELY be picking up some more when I have used up this sample. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

In the couple of weeks I have been using this product, my skin is noticeably brighter, with a much more even tone and an incredible tone. My skin feels tightened and even during the cold winter months I have not had any issues with dry or flaky skin, this has been a issue for me for many years. What really impressed me was how little I needed to use in order to properly moisturize and there was no greasy feeling. My makeup applied over this without any issue.

"olay oh yay i am loving my Olay 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer, just in the past week i have been told by people that i looked like i was in my 30s. My age is 51. So i would say it is doing wonders for me.. Keep up the good work Olay. I need to say we were not discussing aging creams when they thought i was younger than i am. I mentioned to a woman that one of my children were 30 years old and she said she thought i was 30 ! How wonderful to hear such news when you are 51. On the second occurance a woman who was 46 years old thought i was younger than her. i had to say , i am 51. She couldnt believe it. I love Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer and i will be buying myself the full size when i am empty from the trial. Thank You !! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Love this product! I am 73 and all of the Olay Regenerest products leave my skin softer and brighter. I especially like the hydrating eye serum which is lightening the darkness around my eyes This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Not too oily This product works best for my skin because I have very oily skin so it's a great balance of just enough moisture.
Olay Total Effects I can happily recommend this product to all women. I love how it goes on so smoothly and just seems to melt into the skin. I am using it everyday both morning and night. This trial size fits so perfectly into the gym bag that I can also use it after my shower to re-moisturize. I am also finding that my skin is not as thirsty as it normally is in the winter (Canadian winters can be harsh and drying to my skin). I have had a lot of compliments on my skin since using Total Effects and I happily share this secret lol. I will continue to use Total Effects and look forward to the Trial size hitting the shelves so I can keep that size in my gym bag. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
GREAT ANTI-AGING MOISTURIZER I was so excited to receive a free 15ml trial size of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer from BzzAgent. The first day I applied it to my freshly cleansed face and neck before heading to bed . The product went on smoothly without making my skin greasy. It has a nice light scent which is a bonus because I don't like strong scented lotions on my face. The next morning when I woke up I noticed a nice glow to my face without any breakouts. My skin looked healthier and very moisturized after just a couple uses. I even noticed the bags under my eyes that are usually puffy we're definitely reduced and my skin tone evened out a bit more. I am love with this product and I can't wait to get my mom to try it! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
very effective... I think all of them work amazing. I use multiple of the products. I don't buy any other products for my face. I use and people notice so I tell them about them. I think the price are pretty reasonable. Worth paying a little more for the products.
"Happy better improved! So it's been a total of 4 weeks and during the last week I used the cream also during the day. The texture was light enough that it didn't affect my make up routine, very happy about it. Olay Total Effects Anti Aging did delivery in the end. I don't think it took 10 yrs off, but it did improve my skin texture. I did see a glow, my skin felt moisturized and not tight. I was disappointed I didn't notice a reduction in my pore size perhaps after longer use maybe I would definitely consider continuing with this product. I find that a little goes a long way and I'm interested in seeing how long this trial size will last me. Imagine how long a full size would last could possibly see some better and more results!

"Not your Grandma's night cream! I've been using Oil of Olay 7 in 1 anti ageing and so far the results have been amazing! It comes in a hygienic pump and has a nice light scent. I've been using it religiously every night for before bed for a week and I'm already seeing a change in the texture of my skin. It feels smoother and the product seems to be exfoliating some of the dead skin I had. My skin looks clearer and more radiant. I have acne prone skin, so I have to be careful with the products that I use as they can often lead to breakouts. This did not cause me to breakout at all which was a pleasant surprise! Overall I love this product and will 100 be purchasing the full size! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My face loves it! I waited until the very last moment to write this review... I've found with products that go on your face, you cannot jump to conclusions too early. Just because I break out a week into using a new cream doesn't make it the cream's fault. Most likely it's hormonal or response to stress. So I've given Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer weeks to work it's magic, and yes, magic indeed. I have normal skin, albeit a tad on the sensitive side. I do not suffer from constant break outs or enlarged pores. I do have issues with dryness around my nose and chin, and creeping closer to 40 (yikes), I've found my wrinkles want to stand out and be noticed. This moisturizer not only alleviated the dryness around my nose and chin, but I've noticed the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth have actually lessened!! I waited a good long time before I made this judgement. Wanting something often makes you see things that aren't there, but this time, my mind wasn't playing tricks on me! The cream is not heavy, and it smells nice and light (not like some 'old lady' creams I've used before). It did not cause any redness or rashes on my sensitive skin. And a little goes a long way!! I'm very excited about this product, and I have every intention to keep using it. Thank you, thank you, thank you :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"This product is awesome! I have been using olay products for 30 plus years, I love them all."
A great all day moisturizer! I love that this moisturizer absorbs easily and is non greasy.I can't say that it has instantly made me look 10 years younger but since I have been using it I have noticed that my skin is firmer and smoother my pores seem a bit smaller. The unique vitamin complex claims to fight the seven signs of aging such as 1) Minimize the appearance of fine lines 2) Nourish the skin 3) Enhance and even out skin tone 4) Gently exfoliate 5) Minimize and refine pores 6) Defense against free radicals 7) Subtle lifting of the skin for a more youthful appearance I have been using this moisturizer during the day and overnight as well.

"Your Skin Will Thank You! I think that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer lives up to it's claims in helping you look up to 10 years younger with some special bonuses! The first thing that I noticed about this product was the scent. It's very light and almost soothing. After using it just for one week, I began to notice those fine lines disappearing. With continued use, the fine lines are nearly gone and the larger wrinkles have become very minimized. I've tried everything from the cheap and cheerful, to the high end spa lines and not one product has been able to help me achieve results like this and as quickly. The nourishing vitamins that this product is packed with are a clear winner! The only negative thing that I would say is that the trial size bottle spout clogs slightly but it has no effect on the product inside, thus, I will not take away from my rating. The product itself is not greasy, not heavy, nor does it take forever to rub into your skin. A quick, gentle rub on your cheeks and you're wrinkles are done! This is not some complicated, time consuming, overpriced skin regime that makes it a chore to take care of your face. I've also noticed a huge improvement to my overall skin tone, giving me that nice, bright and evenly toned skin that I used to cherish in my younger days. I cannot say enough about this product as it truly does live up to it's promises! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects I was so excited to receive my Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer in my bzzkit. I typically have noticeable redness and an uneven skin tone so I am very excited to see the effects of the Olay towards that. I finished my exercise for the night and grabbed the Olay straight out of the shower. I used two pumps and right away noticed the scent. It's a little more floral than I would like but not unpleasant. The cream was silky smooth and wasn't greasy. It dried into my skin and my husband noticed a difference as soon as I walked into the room - he's a big fan of the scent! Here I am on day 1 wrinkles, creases, redness and dark circles. Looking forward to the total effect results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Best Olay yet! I have been using Olay products for as long as I can remember. I've always loved how it goes on. Never sticky. Greasy. Think feeling. I've been using one of their products and had no idea my skin could Improve as much as it has! I felt like I didn't have dry skin issues, but after 2 days I could feel an incredible difference all over. Not only that, but after a week it looked like I had filled some if my fine lines, and under my eyes looked less saggy/puffy! I cannot wait to buy more! I honestly think any age can benefit from all it has to offer. While I don't have pore issues or age spots, the thought that Olay can help really makes me happy. And the scent. Oh my! Light and clean! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loving my olay 7 in 1 worth every penny I feel that my sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is by far my best sample ever.I truly regret not trying this before now.before trying this product,i never was completely satisfied with my skin care choices.I tried high end produts to dollar store products without being completely happy.i was more often than not breaking out due to the skin product.sine beginning using my olay i am beyond happy with the results.my skin feels healthier due to the unique vitamin complex.It definetly helped to fight the seven signs of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone..i canoot rave enough on how much i love this amazing product....ty olay and bzz agent...

And then I saw my face...now I'm a believer! I am turning 55 soon and had resigned myself to the lines and wrinkles I've earned! However after using this product for only 2 weeks I'm changing my mind about my skin. It has totally evened out my skin tone and there is a definite difference in the depth of my lines. An added bonus is how beautifully easy it is to put on my liquid foundation now that my skin is perfectly moisturized! I was also pleasantly surprised how just a little dollop of this Olay Total Effects is enough to cover my face and neck area. I'm totally pleased with this Olay product! I have already told my family and friends about it and my own mother keeps hinting she's going to 'borrow' it next time she comes over. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Totally satisfied! I have been so happy to try this product! The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti - aging moisturizer has done exactly as it says it will do. I have a dry T- zone which is marked by flaking skin and redness. Since I have been using this product, I have noticed that there is a noticeable decrease in both the flaky skin and the redness (uneven skin tone). I don't have age spots on my face or neck and I don't notice any change in brightness of my skin so I can't speak to those qualities of the product but I have found over the last four weeks that my skin feels and looks more supple and nourished. I am very pleased with this! The fine lines that have been developing around my eyes seem to be improved since I started to use the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging moisturizer. The product has a gentle scent that doesn't seem to irritate my sensitive skin. I also like that I have the option to buy this product without SPF as I am conscious about sun protection chemicals that I put on my body. This is a very pleasing product and is offered at a reasonable price that the average woman would be able to work into her budget. The Olay brand is a solid and reliable brand and once again they have delivered with the 7 in 1 Anti-aging moisturizer. I will definitely be buying this product in the future!

"Wonderful Effects The moisturizer has a nice, gentle scent, not overpowering or harsh. It is not oily or greasy and it absorbs into your skin quickly. I felt it moisturized my face the whole day. I work 12hr shifts and have found previously that sometimes my skin can become dry in certain areas by the end of the day. This did not occur using Olay Total Effects. I did not need to use any other moisturizer throughout the day, so I like the simplicity of just needing the one product. Olay made my skin feel softer and appear younger-looking, it gave me an overall healthy glow.. according to my coworkers and friends. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is trying to fight years and age. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"fantastic anti aging product This is my first time using any Allah product and I have to say Im pretty impressed. First of all I love the packaging. The pump makes things very sanitary and extremely easy to use. Second I like that the moisturizer doesn't have an overwhelming fragrance. The moisturizer goes on smoothly and doesn't leave any streaks. It also doesn't ball up when makeup is applied on top. It absorbs quickly too! After using it for a week, I noticed that my skin tone seems a bit more even. Fine lines also seem less noticeable as well. With an affordable price tag, I would definitely purchase this and recommend it to others! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"AMAZING Results!! I think this new Oil of Olay Total Effects is absolutely AMAZING! I've buzzed about it already, but now after using it for a long period of time, I can see my fine lines and wrinkles have disappeared! My skin is soft and supple. I used to have uneven tones across my face, but now it's all one tone and beautiful! This new blend of anti-aging moisturizers is perfect for anyone wanting to look younger and more healthy. My skin had dark circles under the eyes, and clogged pores before using Total Effects. Now, my eyes are bright and no more clogged pores! Just soft, smooth, younger looking skin!! I really see a huge difference from when I first started! Definitely will be using this for years to come!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effects 7 in 1 moisturizer I received Olay total effects 7 in 1 as part of a buzz agent campaign. I use a moisturizer daily, so I just replaced my normal cream with this one. I noticed the original Olay scent first, I enjoy the freshness of their products as it is not too overwhelming. The scent lightly lingers which is something I also enjoy in a moisturizer. It is a smooth, well made product that produces excellent results without leaving greasy/oily skin. I used way too much on this first application, and realized you need only a pea sized amount for optimal results. It has made my skin softer, and feel more clear. As a busy mother of three, I have already received compliments of looking less tired. Always a bonus in my books! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
actually provides results i looked for. At age 72 I wanted a cream that helped my skin looking healthier. I have more improved results than other products I have tried..I may feel my age sometimes but really don't appear it and most people seem surprised when I tell them I am 72. Therefore I will continue using this and other Regenerist products forever. Since I have had excellent results (or so I think) I see no reason to change.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer After using the product for several weeks, I have noticed the differences. The fine lines and wrinkles around my forehead and corners of my eyes are becoming less visible, the dark age spots are becoming lighter, and I can see that my skin tone is evening out. The product blends really well and I find that several pats all over my face after applying it helps it absorb really well. My skin is smooth and feels moisturized throughout the day without feeling and looking greasy. When I touch my face I can feel how soft applying the product has made it. I did experience a bit of a stinging sensation when I first tried it out, but that has stopped now perhaps due to my skin getting used to the product.

"Bye bye, fine lines. I have dry, blochy, combination skin, that's hard to please. Other products dry it out, or leave a greasy residue that makes me prone to break outs. I'm 36 and have noticed those pesky fine lines creeping up on me, and have always fought with uneven skin tone. I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about 5 weeks now, and have noticed the following... My skin is soft! Not greasy, not dry and patchy, but soft. I've noticed my skin tone is a lot less red, and Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer seems to be smoothing out some of the fine lines around my eyes too. It's like a miracle! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Cheers to Olay and Anti-Aging vitamins!! I have used the cleansing cloths from Olay Total Effects previously, and really enjoyed the product, but I was more than impressed by this moisturizer! After applying it daily over the past month or so, I have noticed that it does indeed live up to its claim to fight the seven signs of aging. Although I don't have too many age spots or wrinkles, it did a great job of evening out my skin tone and fine lines, enhancing brightness, and minimizing the look of my pores. Furthermore, I love that this soothing moisturizer will be available this February in this trial size that I can just leave in my purse! Overall, this is an amazing and affordable product that I will definitely repurchase and incorporate into my daily skin regimen :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Worked great for my skin We've all seen them, ad after ad of products, claiming to be a miracle for your skin. We've all done it, purchased a new product because of all the hype. Now I want to know a few things first, before I spend my money on something. Does this product actually work Now there's the big question. I have combination skin, and get very dry spots. My skin can also look very dull and uneven. After using this product for a week, I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin tone, brightness, and smoothness. My skin feels refreshed, soft, and looks great. Another thing that also pops into my head, is this going to hurt my bottom line Even though I received this sample size for free, I needed to know what I was getting myself into if I liked it. I was very happily surprised, that the price tag isn't rediculous. It is definitley affordable, and it working makes that even better. Lastly, is this something I can honestly see myself using I don't know how many times I've bought a product, saying I'm going to use it, then it just sits there collecting dust. This product is such a simple thing, and easy to just pump some on your hand and swip it on. I usually apply it before my makeup routine, and again after I wash my face at night. No muss no fuss.

"Surprised!! So I received this product and after one use my skin was visibly brighter immediately, and firmer after about half an hour. One use. So Im pretty much expecting to look like a teenager again in a month :) I didnt think drugstore moisturizer could do this but I was fantastically wrong. My skin isnt all that dry, but it just feels lacking in health and I feel like it has been replenished faster than I would think would happen with one product alone. Definitely in line to replace my other skincare products. Much easier to only need one instead of one for this, one for that. If you don't feel as though what youre doing for your skin makes any difference now, try this out, I believe it does absolutely correct a variety of skin issues.

"Loving my olay 7 in 1 worth every penny I was beyond excited to have recieved my sample of olay total effects 7 in1 anti-aging moisturizer.Over the yrs,ive tried a variety of products for my face and was nevr completely happy.The first time i tried olay same,i knew i had a winner.My skin felt so soft and silky after only 1 application.the lines on my face were less noticable after only a week.I was happy with the fact i only needed to use a pump or 2.I love how much firmer my skin feels.Ive gotten alot of compliments on how much healthier ski over the past couple of weeks.This is by far one of the best products that I've ever tried.Its reasonably priced and works better than more expensive products.

"Light and Beautiful I waited to write my review on the product because I felt that I needed to give it awhile to see how it truly did perform. I have had my Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anit-Aging now for a month. It is light in texture and scent. Not over bearing or greasy. Which I must say that I really liked. My skin is not that sensitive but I have noticed with some products that they do bother me. With Olay Total Effects I had not adverse reaction to it whatsoever. My skin felt refreshed and soft. Silky soft to be exact. I love the product. It gives me the protection and moisture that I need. I would compare it to the day moisturizer in the the Cindy Crawford line, which I really liked. I am hoping this will be priced better because I would definitely be thinking of changing over to Olay. I cannot tell yet if it has helped with fine lines or wrinkles as I think it is a little too soon and the bottle is just a trial size. If I had a bit longer to test it I would be able to give a better response to that fact. I was looking for a great moisturizer that felt light and gave me the moisture that I need and with a spf too. So for that fact alone I would most definitely recommend this product to all of my friends and whoever I meet because I think it is a great product.

"best cream out there This stuff is amazing. It's a cult fav. I know of this moisturizer because my mom uses it all the time. She is well in her 50s and gets compliments about her skin every time she is in public. I been using this for only a year, but since then my skin texture was transformed. I use to have many dry patches, and dark spots. I'm only 29 but skincare is extremely important to me. I'm very picky when it comes to skin care products. I'm a cocktail waitress in Las Vegas and work all night so I need a moisturizer that will also help with dullness and making it look energized and beautiful. Olay is the only drugstore brand I find that actually works and is worth buying. I deff recommend this moisturizer. A lot of my friends use it now. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Silky Smooth Olay! After having tried this product for about a month now, I have really come to enjoy it as a daily use moisturizer. I am very happy that this was a product I got to try in the wintertime, as this is the time of year where it really gets put to the test. The air is cold and dry outside, but my skin has not suffered at all, and this is great news!!!!! I ride a bike to work all year long, so it is very important to me that I have a moisturizer that will be able to protect my skin from the dryness outside and not let it get oily when I am inside the office environment. I am very impressed with how Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer holds up to the test. I would be happy to purchase this product again in the future.

smooth not oily Love play have used for years. Just can afford it any more. On a very little fixed income.
"Regenerist I was introduce to Olay Beauty products by the woman on my familiy! I have been using facial moisturiser since teenager age, now at age 40! Regenerist deep Hydration cream is a staple in my beauty routine, it is the only moisturiser that won't make me break out and keep my aging skin beautiful! I have introduce my daughter to Olay as part of her beauty routine and so the tradition continues. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 Anti Aging gets 5 stars from me. I will definitely be purchasing this item and continuing to use it as part of my daily beauty regime. I have dry, sensitive skin..... red cheeks and fine lines around my eyes...... with a sharp line in the center of my forehead which I have always been very self conscious about. I have always been wary of trying new products for my skin due to allergies to perfumes etc. To anyone thinking of giving this product a go, have no fear if you have sensitive skin. Within the first few days of using this product I noticed a dramatic difference in the lines around my eyes....especially my deep line in the center of my forehead.... they almost seemed to disappear. I was really exciting to see this difference. When applying the cream my skin seemed to drink it up.... the moisturizer absorbed quickly and is non greasy. Not only does this product work, but it took years off my face, and has done wonders for my confidence. My redness in my cheeks has also evened out. The dryness in my skin has dramatically improved. With sensitive skin, it is always a guessing game with what products I can use. This product has passed the test in all ways with flying colors! I can not say enough good about this product, and I am so thankful I was able to try it thanks to BzzAgent. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love how it feels on skin It does what it intends to do I would buy again would tell my friends and family to buy this product great for the skin and comfortable.
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer - WOW The unique vitamin complex helped to fight the seven signs of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone. Does this cream work YES! I could not believe the difference in the fine lines around my mouth and eyes after using this cream for just 7 days. I honestly couldn't believe it! The cream has a nice rich (but not greasy) feel and makes your skin look younger! I have sensitive skin and virtually everything I put on my face makes me break out. I have only a few products that are my go to products that I know won't make my face break out. I was wary about trying this new cream on my face. But, I am happy to report, the only thing this cream did is make my skin look and feel better! More even tone and youthful looking! I couldn't be happier!

"first impression I just received my Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti aging Moisturizer sample in the mail yesterday. My daily face routine happens in the morning, so I waited until today to give it a try. Immediately upon pumping the product onto my hand, I noticed at how thick the cream appeared. It had a lovely light scent and went on very smooth. I was I was impressed by how quickly the product absorbed into my skin. After waiting a while I was also very impressed by how quickly my face alreadybfelt like it was firmer. I've tried many anti aging lotions in the past and was skeptical that this one would be any different, and even after just using it once I can already say its got my attention. I'm gonna continue to use this product, and i will update again after a few weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great facial moisturizer! I really enjoyed using this product. I was skeptical at first, because many products claim to fight signs of aging, but after trying it via a 7 day free sample as a BzzAgent, I was impressed. I used over the Christmas holidays, which tends to be a stressful time for me as I'm the main holiday planner for dinner and holiday parties. Normally I feel, (and look!), a bit haggard. Well, this year, my guests were commenting that I looked great, and that I glowed...and asked if I was using a new product. Lol! My personal opinion is that it did seem to help reduce/eliminate the fine lines around my eyes, and my skin tone seemed to even out...I have some areas where my face just seems a few different shades, and this worked to blend them together, somehow. My face just seem to look fresher -- it's hard to describe, but I looked and felt a lot better than I did prior to using the Olay moisturizer. And, my friends noticed! The texture of the moisturizer was smooth, and I didn't have any allergic reactions. I have had reactions to other products, but had no issues with this one -- in fact, I'm almost certain to purchase more when it arrives on store shelves. I'll be keeping my eye open for it! Definitely a good product, and one I can recommend after a good experience with using it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Winning the war against Aging When it comes to anti aging products I am just starting my struggle of weeding through the no goods to find something that holds up to its claims. With Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer i think i have found a winner. I am in love with how soft and supple my face feels even just after a few uses. I usually have quite a dry T zone and this has disappeared! My small little dark spots from hitting the beach and not be prepared for the sun are slowly vanishing with each day that I have used the moisturizer. The vitamin complex is doing wonder for the whole quality of my skin, I am so impressed. I love the bottle dispenser, so easy to pump and apply no unscrewing a lid. Makes the fight against fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone so simple. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So Happy with Olay! I used to exclusively use Olay in my 20's and 30's, and everyone would ask me what I used on my skin. Ironically, back then, everyone guessed I was about 10 years younger than I was (miss those days). Once I hit 40 I thought I better step up my skincare game since I'm older. But, sometimes if it aint broke don't fix it. I started experimenting with skin care a lot, whereas in my 20's and 30's I used only Olay. I guess I figured I had to buy more expensive products once I hit my 40's. This is the first time I've gone back to Olay, and I have to say I am really happy with it! I love the subtle fragrance and the consistency of this lotion. It is extremely hydrating without being greasy. It absorbs right into the skin leaving no sticky residue or film. I am prone to breakouts and Olay has never caused breakouts for me, and still doesn't. I know that Olay contains great ingredients for the skin too. I am noticing a really big difference in my skin overall, and especially the skin on my aging neck, it looks so smooth and young compared to before. Now I'm wondering why I ever stopped using Olay. Maybe we don't have to spend a fortune on skincare just because we're getting older. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Shouting from the Rooftops... OK World...Listen Up! The new Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is the absolute BEST product on the market today! I cannot say enough good things about this product. It is innovating and affordable, which is great for a single mother like me who really can't afford to spend a lot on my beauty routines and products. It helps out with both my combination skin and the extra dryness that accompanies the cold, Canadian weather. I also suffer from mild acne and this moisturizer has actually helped to clear up my acne, instead of contributing to it like most other products seem to do. My skin is the softest it has ever been and I have received so many compliments on how soft and radiant my skin has been looking. A must buy for everyone! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Really liking this face cream! Honestly I was a bit wary to try this product at first because in the past, Oil of Olay creams have made my skin break out. I decided I would give it a try anyways and see if things have changed. When I started using it, I l noticed that it smells good, spreads really well and feels good on my skin. After using it for a week, my skin feels a lot less tight compared to how it used to feel. I like that you don't need to use a lot to feel moisturized. I also like that my skin doesn't feel (or look) oily after putting the cream on my face. This cream feels nice and light and soaks in quickly. I am not sure if it has affected wrinkles or age spots as I don't have many wrinkles yet. I am going to be a larger bottle of this cream and switch to it because it feels better than the cream I was using daily. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"olay total effects It's wonderful. I want more. I don't know what I'd do without it. Every day I automatically moisturize with it and voila my face already feels better.

The lovely scent and silky feeling will encourage you to put this wonderful moisturizer all over your body. But just a little will cover your whole face and make you feel like you have had an amazing facial. The moisturizer quickly disappears into your skin leaving a silky soft feeling that lasts a long time.

"My Trial354 I have finally had a few days to try this Olay product. It did not get delivered to me as it went to another address but fortunately it was recognized by the delivery people and made its way to me. It was worth the wait. I wanted to try this product as it has so many benefits that I thought were perfect for my skin. I am in my early 50 's and have fine lines around my eyes, dark spots , pores that are visible, uneven skin tone and somewhat dull. I particularly noticed using the product 2x day my fine lines visible reduced, pores less visible, dark spots fading and my skin felt soft and not dull. I have not checked the price of this product as yet but definitely will. I think it will be worth the price as it works so well. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Great moisturizer! I wasn't sure what to expect from Olay Total Effects as I have never tried any Olay products before. Well, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. I don't really see much happening as far as wrinkles as concerned however, I do see other benefits that would make me purchase this product. After using Olay Total Effects for a few days my skin felt very well hydrated but not greasy. This moisturizer absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling and was great worn under makeup. I also felt that my skin felt and looked smoother and my pores were definitely minimized. I had some friends even comment that my skin looked more radiant the usual. Not only would I most definitely recommend this product to friends and family, I will be purchasing myself once my bottle is done. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Moisturizer. Lovely Fragrance I had tried this moisturizer a couple year ago when it first appeared on the market. I didn't remember if I liked it of not so I decided to try it again. I can say that after the first two weeks, it has definitely made my skin smoother my skin looks and feel much healthier and nourished. It goes on smooth, doesn't have a greasy feel to it. You dont need a lot to cover your entire face and neck, which is a plus since some moisturizers can be expensive. Finally, I really like the fragrance. I usually dont like most moisturizers fragrance because I find they smell like an old lady but this one isn't strong so you barely notice it and I actually like it! I will keep using it since I like what it has done for my skin and assume the longer I use it, the better it will be. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great product I waited as long as I could to review this product so that I could write an accurate review of whether or not the product works. In general, the product is great. Smooth and light and has a very faint fragrance. Since I received the product I have been using it as directed, twice a day. I have only missed maybe two days due to being out of town etc. I've notice that my pores are definitely smaller. Maybe it's because I'm being diligent in moisturising with this product, but it does work in that regard. My skin looks slightly more evened out. The darker circles under my eyes seem to have lightened, and my skin looks noticeably brighter. I've even had compliments on it. It's easy to use along with my cleanser, and the price is quite good. I will definitely keep purchasing. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good products Good products for my face, smells good, treated my face good"
"One and a Half Pumps BZZAgent was kind enough to send me the 15 mL sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for younger, healthier-looking skin. I used this morning and evening, exclusively for 3 weeks and I enjoyed this product. One and a half pumps would hydrate my face and neck. This didn't irritate my psoriasis on my forehead either, so that was a bonus. I found the redness in my checks was not as pronounced the texture of my skin started to become more even and it moisurized like it was supposed to. All in all I would suggest you look for a coupon and a sale and pick up an Olay Total Effects Moisturizer. This product gets a BEE Shopping recommendation from AngelaBeeThis gets a BEE Shopping recommendation from me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love it!! I have been using this product every morning for the past 11 years! There was once that I went two weeks without it, I will NEVER do that again. I could absolutely tell a difference in my skins appearance. I get complemented on how young I look ALL the time. ( I'm 41). It is a bit expensive, however it last me for about 3 months per bottle."
Great product I luv using this everyday it makes my skin feel so smooth it moisturizing all the time very good product would recommend to everyone
"I love love love this product!!! I am 45 years old, and look fairly young for my age. But recently I have noticed some fine lines, wrinkles and creases. I decided to try Olay Total Effects. I have been using it for a year now. I love it. Every morning after I shower i put it on my face. I have tried most of the Total Effects and I love them all. I had a friend come from out of state to stay with me for a couple weeks and she tried mine and now she is hooked also. Fantastic product...i noticed a difference in the texture of my skin the first time i used it. Not greasy, light, absorbs quickly and my skin feels smooth and moisturized. I notice a change in the fine lines. They really do look as though they have diminished. Thank you Olay!!!! Please don't change it...i am in love with Total Effects!!!"
"Younger looking skin I normally wear makeup most days. Hiding my skin. A couple of weeks ago, I was sick. I did not wear makeup for a few days. Every time that I would go to the washroom I could not help myself but to look at myself in the mirror. I did not recognize my skin. It was healthy looking. I swear I had fine line in certain spots that are now almost gone. The biggest difference for me is my skin looks younger and has a nice glow to it. To top things up. I went to the liquor store last week and was asked for my ID. I am almost 40! What a compliment. That made my whole week. I highly recommend this product. Also the fact that this is way cheaper than other higher brands that I have tried in the past. It just blows my mind. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Improvement after only 2 days! Olay Total Effects promises to fight the 7 signs of aging (fine lines and wrinkles, rough texture, uneven skin tone, dullness, prominent pores, age spots and dryness). After only using this product for 2 days, I've already been asked by two family members what I've been using on my skin! I've been told that my skin is glowing, my pores looks smaller and my skin tone looks more even. I was mostly interested in finding a product that will smooth out my skin and lighten some spots. This moisturizer does that and more! It didn't make me break out or irritate my skin. It's so hard for me to find a product that doesn't make my skin oily but this moisturizer is great under makeup, even without a primer! I will probably continue to use this product after I finish the sample! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love my Olay I've used his products for several months and love my skin again
"Olay Total Effects Effective I am just over the moon with how fabulous Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer works. I rec'd the product to try less than 2 weeks ago and have already noticed a big difference in my facial appearance....woo hoo....I look younger:) I will let my pictures I am posting on facebook speak for themselves as I took a picture before trying this awesome product and a picture at a Christmas party last saturday where my skin looked amazing. Friends and family you simply must try this item when it becomes available in stores as I want everyone to enjoy the disappearance of fine lines, age spots and an awesome skin tone. I was able to try this product for free thanks to BzzAgent and Olay....thank you from the bottom of my skin for letting me try this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer - Nice So I used the product for 4 weeks and I used it morning and night. At first when using the product I felt like there was really not too much of a moisturizing feeling to it, but with continued use that changed, because later it felt more moisturizing. I felt good gliding on the skin and it made my skin feel happy, and protected from the harsh cold weather. I really like this product, but I can't say that I look ten years younger though. I wish :) but I can say it did soften the fine lines and made my skin look brighter and more glowy than I can remember. So yes I really do like this product and I am thinking if I use it for more than 4 weeks I may start looking younger than ever. Thank you for the opportunity to try this product and thank you to Olay as well. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Perfect moisturizer for oily skin I have a difficult time finding a good evening moisturizer that works for my oily/combination skin. While I've often seen ads for Olay Total Effects I had never given their moisturizer a try. I'm so glad that I've had the chance to - it is perfect for my skin! Here's what I love about it: - There's no strong fragrance - I prefer skin care products that aren't loaded with fragrances. - Light texture feel - this moisturizer goes on lightly and smoothly. It has a nice texture and isn't too thick for someone with acne-prone, combination skin. - Many beneficial ingredients - antioxidants, niacinamide, and other ingredients that help combat the signs of aging. Since using Olay Total Effects 7 every night as part of my evening skincare routine I've noticed that my skin looks brighter and some of the darker spots have faded a little bit. It's a keeper for me! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Been on Oil of Olay since I was a teen... I've been on Oil of Olay since I was young. Even thought I will be 48 this year, I look like I'm in my mid 30's. I have oily skin, which can be a real struggle. I use this as my morning routine with my Oil of Olay facial wash. Face, neck, and chest area. The neck and chest age as well."
"Excellent-Feels great I'm always on the look out for moisturizer that feels great on my skin, is lightly perfumed, and actually makes my skin feel wonderful. I tried the sample size and I'm back to buy the larger size. :D I rarely leave ratings, but this one deserves it. It's like a mid-weight cream and applies smoothly. After application...omg, my face feels fantastic. Smooth, non-greasy. It doesn't feel heavy and feels like a much more expensive cream. Try it. :D"
"Perfect I tried the trial size first got hooked almost immediately. It only takes a few days to notice the effectiveness of this product. My skin is smoother, brighter, more moisturized overall better. I have incredibly sensitive skin I tolerate this product very well."
Great hydration! This product has been so perfect for aging skin. Deeply moisturizing and feels light on the face. Love going to bed knowing I'll wake up with great results when I wake. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Absolutely amazing Everyone has to try this product. Olay 7 in 1 has just become my favorite moisturizer is leaves my skin smooth and not greasy at all. I have tried every product on the shelf and this one is far better than the rest. It's so light weight and feels great weather I wear it under make up or just on its own. Over the past two weeks I have noticed a huge dramatic change in my skin. This time of year really dries out my face leaving me with dry spots, but now that I have found Olay 7 in 1 I will never have that again. (I just hope my trial lasts until it comes out in february). I have spoken to many girlfriends about this cream and they can't wait to try it! Another bonus is that my skin seems more refined, no more big pores on my cheeks! Yay. For anyone out there you have got to try this, you wont be disappointed. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"3 Months Later..... I have been using this product now for 3 months and I am in love! I was happy with Olay products before but now I'm over the moon! I have had so many people asking how I keep my skin looking so great and I am more than happy to share my secret with them. I was worried when I first started using this new Olay product as I tend to have very finicky skin. Any change in moisturizer and it fights back with the dreaded acne...yes even at my age. I'm happy to say that I had absolutely no negative reaction using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer! Smooth skin, even tone and way less wrinkles! I don't even like covering it up with foundation anymore! My mom's birthday is in January and I have bought this product for her ....she only hinted 50 times she wanted to try it too!! I'm an Olay user for life! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A great daily face cream I have been using the cream for a few weeks now and have found it to be a good daily use cream. It goes on smooth, isn't too thick or thin (good consistency), has a pleasant fragrance that isn't overpowering, and moisturizers quite well. Although, I find in the winter months, I could use a tad more moisture on my skin. As to all the benefits that apparently come with using the cream, I'm a bit skeptical. I haven't noticed my fine lines or wrinkles improve and didn't really notice a difference with reducing the appearance of pores. I also don't really see a restoration of firmness either. That said, I don't really believe there is a moisturizer that can actually do all of the things Olay claims to be able to do. I mostly use moisturizer to do just that, moisturize and feel good on my skin and the Olay Total Effects moisturizer does do that for sure. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great face cream that can be worn both alone and under make-up, the face cream is very light and wearing it under your make-up doesn't make it feel like you have too much products on your face at one time....the product i found leaves my skin soft and smooth, i noticed a visible change in the appearance of my skin including fine line reduction in just the short period of time that i have been using the product....this product leaves my skin feeling very moisturized without leaving my skin feeling greasy, i have never tried a face cream that i have ever enjoyed as much as this one and it is now become a part of my daily facial routine....i recommend that if you are in any way undecided on whether or not to try this product that you just try it because you will not be disappointed!

"10 years younger with Olay Total Effects I have been using this fabulous moisturization for over a month now....love it! I don't know that my skin looks 10 years younger but I love the added moisture, it sinks into my skin beautifully, it's not oily and it didn't cause any breakouts. I enjoy the fact that it's fragrance free....and also available in an SPF formation. It claims to fight the seven signs of aging: smoothes fine lines and wrinkles (yup have noticed looking better around the eyes) :evens skin tones and appearance (I have gone out with just this and my boyfriend says I glow) :minimizer the look of pores visually reduces age spots (thankfully don't have any yet) :replenishes moisture, firmness (check my favourite part) So I will be buying this as soon as I can now! Recommend for all my friends on the cusp of aging! Thanks Bzz Feed. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Really great product So I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for over a week now and I love it. It is so light that you can't even feel that it is on your skin. Sometimes if I don't put my makeup on right away I actually have to stop and think if I applied the product it is that light feeling. But don't think that because it is light weight that it means that it is not doing its job. I have notice an improvement in my skins tone and general appearance. I have also noticed that the few lines that I do have around my eyes and the worry line on my forehead looks less noticeable. Plus I have very dry skin especially when it is cold and windy (and where I live the last week has been -20 with blowing wind) and my skin is not dry at all! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a anti-aging product. Love this product gotitfree. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"One month,10 years younger I think Olay Total Effects has certainly lived up to their claims.with an unique vitamin complex. The formula is enriched with. In four weeks I noticed the results of the following: -wrinkles and laugh lines are less visible -my skin has a noticeable glow -firmness around and under eyes -pores are smaller -skin tone is more even -smoother, softer skin I like that it is invisible to apply and fragrance free, having sensitive skins it is hard to find a cream that works without a rash or an allergic reactions . It has the bonus of sun screen added so going outside there is no applying un-wanted sunscreen lotions. The bottle it self has a easy to use pump to access the Olay Total Effects. I do recommend to family and friends the Olay Total Effects, I got great results and they can too. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love it Omg flawless no matter what I use I can't get enough if olay
"Olay My Skin So Smooth I'm in my early thirties. I have normal to dry skin year round,with occasional break-outs around that time of the month. Have struggled with finding the right moisturizer. I have tried numerous ones such as Vichy, Biotherm, Lancome, Mary Kay, L'Oreal, Clinique, and many others. I just want something that makes my skin feel good and moisturized. Nothing was working how I wanted it to. I remember as a child my mother saying that she used to use oil of olay lotion, and her skin still looks young. So when I got the chance to try out the Olay Total Effects Lotion sample, I jumped on it. My skin feels great with this cream on, it absorbs evenly and leaves my skin soft. Just go out and try it if you haven't. I think you will be very surprised on how your skin feels, even after a few applications. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This stuff is great! I had never used this product before - I had seen it on the shelves at the drug store, and know that Olay is an excellent project, but honestly the price point was an issue for me. I think I might be changing my tune. I have only been using it for a week and so far am over the moon with the product. I know that they say 4 weeks to notice a difference but as far as the smoothness of my skin I have already noticed a difference. I have very sensitive skin and so far have had no issues. There is no overwhelming odor and it goes on feeling lovely with no greasy feeling after. Since using the sample I have ceased using anything else as far as moisturizer. I love it and will DEFINITELY be picking up some more when I have used up this sample. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The Best on the market Having tried numerous products from OTC to Expensive online products, at almost 52yrs old, I found myself returning back to Olay. I wish I'd have begun Regenerist at least 10 years ago! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Light and non greasy feels great on the skin Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Goes on so smooth and non greasy. Feels light and airy on the skin. I've had moisturizers or anti aging products that have felt 'heavy' or greasy. None of which apply to this product. I see that it really penetrates into where I need it most fine lines or wrinkles. But never feels heavy on the skin. I like the way the product absorbs into the skin. Also the fact that it fights the seven signs of aging. Also for those who have sensitive or don't like fragrance. It is fragrance free. Vitamins and antioxidants which are beneficial and also necessary for your skin. Namely Vitamin B3. I like how moisturized my skin feels with no 'heavy' or greasy feel. Just light airy and well hydrated. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I have been using the trial size of Olay total effects moisturizer for four weeks now and I love it! It's a great product! It is nice and light. It goes on smooth and is not greasy on my face. It absorbs in right away and my face feels nice and smooth and well moisturized. It seems to maybe even control oil a bit too. My face doesn't get as oily during the day when I have it on as it usually does with other moisturizers. A little of this product goes a long way. One small pump and it covers my face and neck. I have noticed after using this moisturizer that the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are reduced and my skin is brighter and firmer. My skin tone is also more even now which is great. I would definitely recommend this product to others and will be buying it for myself as well. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Must buy and try So, I've been using this product for 3 weeks straight now. And if I had one word to sum it up, it would be....amazing!!! Before using Olay 7-1, I was using Clinique. This Moisturizer has it all. It's light weight and hydrates my skin. I used it everyday (some days twice) and have noticed a considerable difference in my tone and glow of my skin. It's minimized the fine lines that I had and evened out the overall appearance of my skin. I feel like I have that natural glow.....without the makeup. The one thing that I love about this product was how it kept my skin moisturized. I can't stress how dry my face was and now that we are into our winter months it counts on keeping it extra moisturized. I love this product. Plus it's much less expensive than the brand I was using before. Before trying this out I had high hopes. My current brand wasn't giving me the results that I wanted and the ones before that, same thing! I'm so happy I got invited to this campaign. i'll never go back to the other brands. My friends and family have noticed a difference. Got them to buy their own bottles. My mom, who has age spots saw a noticeable difference. I'm so happy to spread the word on this. Makes me happy that I see all of them with the same glow as I have This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I love Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I was thrilled to get a trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer from BzzAgent just in time to go on our annual vacation to Mexico. I used it every day after a full day in the sun, sand, pool water and salty ocean. My skin felt soft, and it absolutely glowed despite temperatures in the high 80's every day. This was a real test for the product and it passed with flying colours. I would recommend it to everyone! I even used it on my Husband's face nightly, and his skin never looked so good. It evens out the tone, and seems to minimize the appearance of fine lines. So, yes, it is fantastic for both ladies and men skin. And is a product I will be happy to purchase for family for many years to come. Awesome. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Total Effects is Totally Effective!! Everyone needs a face moisturizer, so why not get one that does more than just that. Olay's Total Effects 7 in 1 anit-aging moisturizer does that. Benefits besides moisturizing include Minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles Balancing skin's color and tone while reducing the appearance of age spots Smoothing skins texture with gentle exfoliation Refining to minimize pore appearance Protecting skins surface with antioxidants Firming skins appearance with hydration My skin looks so much better than before. Only a pea size amount is needed to moisturize your face. My skin absorbed it quickly and did not leave any residue! It was great having a trial size to see if the product worked on my skin. Now I know that it does, I will definitely be getting a full size. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Full Facial in a bottle! I think I have found my new anti-aging moisturizer...Since receiving this amazing product for free from Bzzagent my skin has never felt better. I put about a pea size on the tip of my finger and found that the little bit I used, covered my whole face. Not to mention the smell...mmmmmmm, it was so nice. Not too strong and has such a fresh feeling scent. Overall since using this product my skin has been noticeable smother and my fine lines around eyes and mouth have faded quite a bit. My skin tone has since improved overall and I feel so much better when I apply my make up. It did not irritate my skin once and was a very lightweight formula. I have found my go to moisturizer for sure since trying Olay. I suggest you give it a try, there is nothing to lose but maybe a few wrinkles ) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Skin feels great Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer promises to reduce 7 signs of aging like reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, soothe and nourish dry skin, balance color and tone and reduce age spots. Since I have started using this moisturizer I have noticed the fine lines around my eyes have started to diminish. Unlike other anti-aging products I find this product to be great for my sensitive skin. It does not cause any redness or reaction it actually is reducing the areas of redness on my skin making my overall skin tone more even. I love how the unique vitamin complex absorbs into my skin without leaving a greasy feeling behind. It gets rid of the dry spots in my cheek area but at the same time does not make my oily t-zone worse. I really love this moisturizer! I feel like the product delivered what I expected of it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"More than I expected I think I was expecting a basic moisturizer because so many brands claim to have *the* greatest formula for one issue or another I've been using the Olay 7 effects for weeks now, and am so impressed. My skin almost immediately began to show differences. It looked smoother, clearer, and those teeny lines that are beginning to form around the corners of my eyes seem less... I have had no issues with skin sensitivity, and I have pretty easily aggravated skin when it comes to product.. It isnt heavy at all which I prefer because I don't want to feel like I have a layer of cream on my face - it absorbs reasonably fast, and isn't heavily scented like some products. I like that my skin looks fresh and clear without foundation - yes! Overall this lotion will end up in my product faves, it gets two thumbs up, five stars, 10 out of ten!

"Silk in a bottle Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer claims: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - I don't have many wrinkles yet, but I don't doubt it will work when I do Evens skin tone appearance - my face seems less blotchy :D Enhances brightness - my face did receive a nice glow! Minimizes the look of pores - I don't have big pores but this moisturizer maintained their invisibility Visibly reduces age spots - I don't have those yet, but since I'm using this product, I doubt I'll get them or even if I do, I'm certain they'll be reduced visibly Restores firmness - I have noticed some improvement around my slightly droopy eyelids Replenishes moisture - My skin feels smooth and soft to the touch Thank you, BzzAgent for the opportunity and Olay for the wonderful product! Full-sized bottle and my go-to moisturizer, for sure! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Works When It's Freezing Cold Outside! The freezing temperatures finally kicked in so today I got a chance to put the moisturizer to the wind and cold test and it passed. My face isn't sensitive, but it does get dry during the winter. I can feel my skin drying and tingling sometimes when I go outside during winter. I just got back from walking my dog and felt no such sensations at all in the cold and wind thanks to Olay's Total Effects. I scrubbed my face with a pumice wash meant for hands (something I use once a week) and then applied the moisturizer after the rinse and went out. I was impressed that for a lotion that feels so light, it really did its job in the southern Canadian cold! I was out for about 30 minutes in moderate wind and my face felt fine. I never thought of Olay making a lotion effective enough to use during the dead of winter, but this one works! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Wonderful Night or Day I use this as a night time moisturizer but on a recent trip it was the only thing is my bag so i used it for day too. It worked will with my make up and I was especially amazed by how well it worked for all day moisture. My skin tends to get dry at the end of the day but with this product I was still fine until cleansing at night. I highly recommend this product for dry skin and aging skin.

"olay 7 in 1 amazing I can not say enough good things about this product, I will never go a day without it!!!!!!! Everyone I know that I have told to. Try olay total effects has tried it and loves it. While at a Christmas party a few weeks ago I did a bit of bzzing. I told everyone a bit about how I try products for bzz agent and that my latest product was such a great one that everyone absolutely had to try. I told them how much I love the way it makes my skin feel, and how smoothed out the appearance of my skin has become sense first using it. My pores are smaller and my skin tone looks so much more even. I often have people comment n how young I look but without a doubt I have received more comments on my completion than I ever have and I gave all the credit to olay total effects. Thanks again to bzz agent and olay. This product is a winner! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smooth and Moisturized Thanks to BzzAgent, I received a sample-sized Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. The cream cream has a unique vitamin complex which helps fight the seven sings of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone. I have been using the sample every morning and night for five days now. It has a nice fragrance and a little goes a long way! I love that it is light enough for day use since it doesn't make my skin greasy and shiny, but strong enough for night time by thoroughly moisturizing my face after my shower. I must also point out that I have a fairly sensitive skin, but I had no negative reaction whatsoever. Instead, my skin appears to be brighter and smoother and much healthier (especially during this dry season). I will definitely continue using Olay Total Effects once my sample size is finished. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So far so gooe It's only been two days of using my trial size Olay 7 signs anti aging Cream and I have to say so far I'm super impressed. My skin appears to be cleaner , fresher and brighter in general. My skin tends to be on the more oily side and I find this moisturizer has combated excess oil throughout the day. A little bit of this wonderful concoction goes a long way. I find one pump from the bottle is more than enough to do my whole face and my neck. I look forward to also trying the moisturizer by this line with the SPF 15 that is also another great option to prevent wrinkles and sun damage. I'm heading to the store tomorrow to get a brand-new shiny bottle of this and I'll pass my trial onto my friend so she can enjoy the wonderful benefits as well. Thank you buzz agent and Olay for giving me to opportunity to try this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This is actually a question If this product is oil free, why doesn't it say so on the product container Is it oil free or non-pore clogging (can't remember the phrase) l used the 1.7 oz moisturizer, didn't buy again. Don't really remember why, maybe the cost or maybe blackheads came back. I can ONLY use oil free products. I hope this is, if so I will buy it again."
"A great moisturizer with added benefits I actually really enjoyed this product and was surprised that I could see results in as little as a few days, particularly with my skin appearing more moisturized. But this might be because my skin is somewhat sensitive and quite dry most of the time and happened to take to this moisturizer quite well. Since having used it for a few more weeks, I've noticed that my pores have become less noticeable and that I haven't had to use a primer to help minimize them lately. The fine lines I'm not sure about yet but perhaps I need to use it a bit longer to see more visible results, but my skin has definitely become smoother and more even, which makes going out without putting on makeup or anything more than a tinted moisturizer a lot easier. The product goes on smoothly for me and I find I don't need to use to much to cover my face, and the scent is not overpowering. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Miracle in a bottle My mother has always told me to keep my skin moisturized to avoid aging quickly and to avoid the sun. Drinking a lot of water to improve elasticity. I have found my miracle in a bottle. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is the best thing in the world. This moisturizer is really good and it lives up to all of its promises. The product goes on smoothly and it feels light weight but it protects my skin. After using it for a week I had noticed that my skin was smoother and my wrinkles was reduced because my skin was feeling really moisturized. My blotchy red spots was evened out. I also noticed that my skin was brighter and less dull looking, my skin looks a little dull during the winter due to drier skin. The pores on my nose was reduced. My skin had gotten its elasticity back and felt firmer to the touch. I have even noticed that the dark patches under my eyes have been reduced. I have been really lucky to have been chosen to try this product from BzzAgent. This product is truly a miracle in a bottle. I have recommended this product to all my friends and relatives. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This product smells exquisite I love the way it feels on my face. I feel beautiful
"Overall Thoughts I have been a user of Olay products for almost 20 years and I have always thought they were great products, Total Effects is no different. I have not only been a purchaser of the product for years but I have also purchased it for other people as gifts and encouraged them to buy it on their own. It is a great moisturizer. During this campaign I have mentioned it to many family and friends as I have over the years and encouraged those that haven't already purchased Olay products to give them a chance because I have found that they are the best products to see lasting results over many years of use. They might not be great for short term fast effects but for the long term they are excellent. Most people that I talk to about Olay products are very open to trying them and many have become long term users over the years. I feel like I am always telling people how great Olay products are so i guess you could say that I buzz about them constantly not just during this campaign :) I will continue to be an Olay user for years to come, I am always excited to see what kinds of products they are coming up with and am usually the first to try the new creams they release. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
My skin but better What a great time to be able to sample this Olay Moisturizer. In the winter my skin gets much drier then normal with the cold air and the lack of humidity in the house. This Olay moisturizer worked wonderfully to both moisturize and make my skin look better overall. My skin has a more even appearance and looks a lot brighter than it did. My pores seem smaller too. I don't have any wrinkles or fine lines luckily so I can't attest to how this works on them. In conclusion I am very happy with this product and would consider purchasing it in the future. I must also say that a little goes a long way and the sample size lasted quite a while so if anyone is worried about cost savings don't be. You will be pleased with the results that you will get from this moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"buy buy bags So far so good. I was skeptical that I would see any difference in my skin, but YAY I do. The biggest change I see is the decrease in puffiness and dark circles under my eyes. Not sure if this is what this product was suppose to do this but Im OK with it. :) I noticed the biggest different when putting on makeup. I needed less coverage under my eyes. I am not seeing muh difference with fine lines, but I noticed a decrease in pore size around my nose. They are not are noticable in harsh light. Besides those great qualities, it also has a pleasant nonintrusive smell, its not oily or feels stiff , you need very little for full coverage and my skin feels super good. I am going to continue using it, because of the above results so far and hope maybe after a few weeks of treatment I will see decreased fine lines. :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"have used for years love it This is one of the best face creams I have used and I have tried many. It is non-greasy, yet adds moisture. Unlike other products, I have never had a skin reaction to this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Ageing Moisturizer I was very excited to receive my free sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Ageing Moisturizer from BzzAgent. I love the clean fresh scent and the texture is perfect - not heavy and oily or so light it feels watery. My skin absorbed this moisturizer right away and my foundation seemed to apply much smoother (a definite bonus). I've been using this moisturizer for 22 days now and I've already noticed less wrinkles, fine lines, greater firmness and more even skin tone (less redness on my cheeks). I've suffered for years with a stubborn dry patch of skin on the bridge of my nose and now it is all but gone -amazing moisture retention! If this is sold at a reasonable price point then I'm definitely switching to Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Ageing Moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Bye Bye Middle Age! I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 for about 2 weeks now. I use it every morning before applying my makeup for work. I love the smooth way it goes on my face and the smell is good too. I suffer from migraines so having a product that doesn't have a strong smell is very important to me. I still have another 2 weeks to go but I can honestly say that already I am seeing a bit of a difference especially around my eye area. I have not used this product before and I know that I will be buying more once my trial size is finished. I feel good about this product and feel confident that based on what I have seen so far that it truly does help fight the signs of aging. My skin tone is uneven and this seems to have helped because I no longer look in the mirror and see the splotches that I did before. Way to go Olay! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love Olays Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer Since I've started using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer my skin feels alot healthier in general. It feels tighter, more moisturized, softer and less oily. The unique vitamin complex found in Olay's cream helps to fight against the 7 signs of aging including evening out skin tone, reducing fine lines and eliminating age spots. I found I did not need to use much of this cream per use which is fabulous so you can extend the life of your bottle. Also I would not wake up with an oily face after using this, many other creams make my face feel very oily unfortunately. I highly recommend buying this product. If you're still not convinced you can buy the trial sized bottle instead of fully committing to a full bottle, which is fantastic as well :) :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects Effective 2 I am just over the moon with how fabulous Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer works. I rec'd the product to try less than 2 weeks ago and have already noticed a big difference in my facial appearance....woo hoo....I look younger:) I will let my pictures I am posting on facebook speak for themselves as I took a picture before trying this awesome product and a picture at a Christmas party last saturday where my skin looked amazing. Friends and family you simply must try this item when it becomes available in stores as I want everyone to enjoy the disappearance of fine lines, age spots and an awesome skin tone. I was able to try this product for free thanks to BzzAgent and Olay....thank you from the bottom of my skin for letting me try this product. Here is my after picture less than 2 weeks later. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Its amazing This product works so good you will wonder why.you.never bought it before.
"new skin care holy grail I have never tried Olay fsce lotion before but I am more than pleased with this product. It is a light moisturiser which spreads easily with a loght scent but doesn't irritate my overly sensitive skin. As with other reviews I've read, one pump is enough to cover my face and neck completely. I like how it has a pump instead of dipping your fingers into a pot which makes it hygenic! It makes my skin feel really smooth and not only gives it a healthy appearance it feels healthier and my pores look smaller. I've already recommended this to my friends and family because i trult do believe they need to try this out for themselves so they can then see the benefits that the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has to offer!! Thank you bzzagent OlayUS This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Product is a amazing Works so well on my skin never oily or greasy blend in so quickly
Olay Awesome product I think u should buy this amazing product because it smells and feels amazing and it makes your skin feel very hydrated
"Getting younger everyday! I haven't had a chance to use the product for the full four weeks to really comment on the 7 benefits of the product, but so far I like what I'm using! I'm pretty picky about my face products and was a strict Biotherm girl! However, I really think I could switch to Olay after this. First of all there is the price point differnce between my usual brand and Olay. Olay is much more affordable than Biotherm. Secondly, I love the way my skin feels right now. I can't say if it's fighting off those fine lines as I sit here and type this, but I can say that I have much smoother skin and the tone feels more even! I find that my skin doesn't dry out as fast using Olay. Normally the air is much drier at this time of year and I need to get my skin treatment on my face as soon as I get out of the shower or my face gets very flakey. I find now with Olay I can wait a few minutes before jumping into my skin care routine and by the time I put on my pressed powder my skin is still soft and not dry. The moisture level is great! Overall I give this product an A+ and I will certainly buy it when I run out of the sample size! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The difference is there! Winter time in Canada is upon us, and with the cold weather comes wood heating. Wood heating means dry skin. Finding a good moisturizer has always been a tedious task for myself, I've never found a product that will help keep my face moisturized without leaving a greasy looking residue, until now. Since I've started using Olay Total Effects, I haven't had any dry skin on my face at all! It doesn't leave any greasy residue behind, it goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and it does all this without drying out sensitive facial skin. I've also noticed that since I started using Olay Total Effects, the unique vitamin complex has definitely helped even out my uneven skin tone cause by sun exposure, past scaring and aging! This is absolutely a product I would recommend to anyone who's looking for a great moisturizer, with a ton of added benefits to fight the 7 signs of aging!

"I'm sold on Regenerist! I have used expensive creams from Strivectin, Clinique, Lancome, etc. And only one worked out for me. Its the oil of Olay regengerist serum that I apply each night and every morning, follwoed by the oil of olay hydrating cream. It made my skin glow. I can feel my skin soaking up and drinking the Olay. I love the way my skin looks and how it feels! From now on, Regenterist is what i will be using."
"Looking your best at any age Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has renewed me! I think that over the last few weeks my life has changed dramatically. LET'S FACE IT...no one likes getting older. This year I turned 40 and I noticed little lines and a dullness to my complexion that seemed to sneak up over night. Lucky for me, I was chosen to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the last month. Today I am happy to say that I look younger and refreshed. I can easily leave my house without makeup and for once I don't stress what others see. I have a new found confidence. Hard Canadian winters tend to make my skin dry and flaky. This is the first winter my skin is flake free and soft. Even my husband noticed the difference...lets keep the secret between us. Bottom line...my lines are softer, age spots are a thing of the past and my face is brighter and my skin tone is even...best part is moisture for days! Ps. The pump is easy to use, and the scent is light and divine. TWO thumbs way up...thanks Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and Buzz Agent for letting me try it for free...I am hooked This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Product I received the sample and I just finished my second week of using it day and night so going on my third week. At first when using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer i did not really care for it, it seemed like it did not have enough moisturizing to it, but I gave it a chance still and especially night time I found the results much better for moisturizing. I can see that my tone is evening out slightly right now and my skin feels great. I find the sample is plenty to use, one suggestion to those who are using this product or any product is that a little goes a long way, never understood why people think that they should coat their face with a thick layer of cream or lotion when less then half the amount of that works great. I find one pump of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is plenty enough to see results. Going on week 3 as I stated at the start of this post. Looking forward to seeing what new surprise I see each day I wake up :). But thus far really like the product, does not have a major fragrance smell to it and seems quite gentle to the skin. One pump is all it takes. See you in 2 weeks for a complete update. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I've found my new moisturizer - love this product! I have been using a variety of different moisturizers from Aveeno to Dermologica and I have to say that I am so very happy to have finally found a moisturizer I love in Olay Total Effects! It goes on silky, doesn't sting or irritate my somewhat sensitive skin - major plus! The scent is lovely and not overwhelming- I have had problems with scents in the past giving me headaches so I am so pleased this does not happen with Olay Total Effects. My skin feels smooth and most importantly- my skin feels replenished/hydrated the colour seems even and not blotchy. I love every aspect of this moisturizer and I am using it morning and night. I wish I had coupons to give out to friends cause I can't stop raving about this product - if you can - go try it! (Oh and anti-aging I can't really comment on yet since it is early on but how great will it be if that aspect works too!) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good Product, Light Scent I was happy to have the chance to try this, and it didn't disappoint. Now that I'm getting a bit older (38), I am more interested in these kinds of products than I used to be, because I want to prevent signs of aging...if possible. :-) I'd a prevent-it kind of gal, not a wait-till-it's-here-to-deal-with-it kind of gal. Anyway, I like the cream very much. I appreciate that it has a light scent - this is important for me, as I get wickedly bad migraines, and strong scents can trigger them. I also like the texture - it goes on smooth, and sinks into my skin, withouth leaving a greasy feeling after, as many creams seem to do. I can't say that I noticed any improvements in my skin, but I am confident that if I had a larger bottle, and continued to use it daily, I would! I appreciate the chance to try this, and would definetly consider purchasing it in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Anti Aging Awesomeness! I have only good things to say about this awesome anti ager! my 7 signs that i love it are: 1) the scent - mmm! light and nice. 2) my face looks brighter - great for my cheekbones! 3) my pores eat it up! - usually i can only use serums creams won't penetrate into my skin and when i rub my skin the cream just balls off. not with total effects. 4) my skin feels soft and smooth - sweet! 5) my face/neck are moisturized - a must for these cooler days. 6) minimizes my pores! - with the colder weather setting in, i just noticed this year that my pores are enlarged. this moisturizer has helped to reduce those holes. 7) i love the travel size - wish it was out sooner than february. i will be buying one for my purse, one for home, and one for my mom. 7 in ONE - i say, Heaven in ONE! Anti Aging Awesomeness! in a sweet size. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Anti-ager and GREAT MOISTURIZER!!! Let me start by telling you the Pros and Cons, let just get the facts straight off! PROS: Balances skin, Gentle , Improves skin texture, Leaves a great clean feeling, Moisturizing, Not greasy ( thank god! ) , Sensitive friendly. CONS: Umm I don't have any yet!! I've been using the Total Effects line for only a week, and to be honest it's been the first moisturizer in a long time for me. My skin looks and feels great, for the whole day.... My daughter tried a bit and she has very sensitive skin and she had no problems with it, I actually just went to walmart last night a bought a full sized bottle..lol It's not greasy or sticky, and we find that it really sinks into the skin when you put it on.. it's not like some where you can still feel it on your skin hours later.. I this this is going to turn out to be my favourite Moisturizer ever... I believe this is the best I've used and worth every penny.. ( well its not crazy expensive to start ). I'm going to keep trying it for another week or two and then come and give my final thoughts about it.. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"olay total effects This product is amazing ! Within the first few days the brown marks on my face lightened to the point where they were the same color as the rest of my skin. This is the first product I have ever tried that had that capability ! For hydration perfect ! I suffer from dry patches through the winter horribly, but with olay total effects I could put this on my face before I go to work and 12 hours later off of work my face is still moisturized and no flaky skin. I was impressed . The most amazing part of this product is that the lines around my eyes seem to disappear . It is like they just vanished dabbing this cream around my eyes everyday for the allotted time of 4 weeks. If you look close enough you would see the difference day by day .I did get this product free from bzzagent :) The unique vitamin complex helped to fight the seven signs of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone.

"Moisturizes well -- easy on sensitive skin This new Olay product is the real deal. Ive been using my free sample as a day cream for a week now and thanks to the unique recipe of vitamins (Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), Panthenol (Vitamin B5) and antioxidant Vitamin E ), my skin is already noticeably less red, more fully moisturized and even-looking. The texture of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is perfect -- it goes on easily, its not too oily or gloppy and it doesn't leave your skin feeling dry. There's no stinging or redness (a real shocker since my skin is super sensitive, and this is a drug store brand). It works well under make-up, I tried it successfully as a primer under two different make-up counter products. It has already healed up some dry spots that arrived with cold dry winter air. The only downside: my sample is scented, next time I'll try the unscented option. I'm looking forward to saying goodbye to those irritating signs of aging: fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone they say it takes about four weeks to see the full benefits of this great new product .

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 is complete face care! I am very happy I agreed to participate in the campaign for Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. As a woman with minimal spare time and aging skin, I often hope to find a facial skin care product that multitasks as much as I do. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer does everything I expected it to. Over time, we all try new products but after using an Olay product again, I have to ask myself why I ever switched. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has reduced some of the fine lines around my eyes, my skin is much more touchable and the glow is undeniable. The cream spreads easily and leaves no greasy or oily feeling. Even better is the fact that others noticed! I loved it so much I bought a full size bottle to continue using it. An added bonus for me is the fact that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer smells just like the Olay my grandmother used. It tells me some things don't need to change when they work.

"Smooth n silky Love it Well I've used Olay total effects for a while now, and have noticed very good results! I love the the pump style bottle it comes in. I have used a lot of exspensive spa line products and The texture of the cream is silky smooth and is not to watery or to heavy on the skin. It absorbs nicely and gives your skin a smooth hydrated feeling! I notice a slight tint to the lotion which is probably what gives my skin a nice glow! Love all the high quality performance ingredients in total effects. My skin tone looks much more even and hydrated since using it, I have a healthy looking glow and my fine lines seem a bit smoother. I am very happy with this product and now I get to continue to take care of my skin thanks to olay total effects! I will be using it for an even longer period of time I may see even more results! Love :) more love for the price for such a high quality moisturizer ! Thanks Olay for giving me the opportunity to try this great product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This product works well for dry skin. Works well without making your face greasy. Worked wonders for my face. I had dry skin onu face and one application made my face regenerated.
"Olay for life I have seen Olay Total Effects in the stores I shop at for beauty products multiple times. I've even picked it up and debated buying it. For some reason I always ended putting it back on the shelf and going to my usual skin cream which just so happens to be another Olay product. Recently my usually skin cream seems to be reacting with my skin and causing dryness and flaking. I started putting less on to see if it would help but it didn't seem to do the trick. I couldn't stand not putting any cream on either because naturally I have dry skin and I can't stand dry itchy skin on my face. I was all to keen on trying the Olay Total Effects when it arrived in the mail. I was using it the very same day it arrived. I lathered it on my skin and by lathered I mean I applied it thick, I just wanted to see what it could do! By the end of the day my dry skin disappeared and the redness from the irritation of dry skin had all but disappeared as well. I'm a very happy girl!

"Smooth, better looking skin. After using this Olay Total effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer for a while, I can see a difference! The unique vitamin complex in this moisturizer helps fight signs of aging! I've noticed how this moisturizer has evened out my skin tone, and chaos cleared up my acne prone skin. This moisturizer leaves my face feeling so soft and fresh. My main concern before I purchase a new facial product, is if it's actually going to work, and if it's actually going to clear up my acne prone skin, and not break my face out even more. I am pleased to tell anyone that is afraid of trying new facial products, that Olay total effects 7 in 1 moisturizer is by far one of the best skin products I have ever used. I do not have a lot of wrinkles (yet) but if I keep using this moisturizer (which I will) then I am positive this product will help if not prolong the wrinkles from coming! Love this product, and I strongly recommend to anyone looking for a great anti aging moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"BEST MOISTURIZER EVER!! I have been using Olay Total Effects for about 3 months. My skin has never looked as good as it does now. My skin is soft, pores seem minimized, sun spots seem lessened, and my skin is more radiant than ever. Olay Total Effects is not greasy, absorbs quickly and has a light, clean scent. I have used Oil of Olay (original pink lotion) probably since I was in my teens (I am now 52), but within the last couple of years, I noticed that I needed more moisturizing for my skin. I have tried several different products, but none were good. I decided to give Olay Total Effects a try (I should have stuck with Olay, but thought the higher-priced moisturizers were what my mature skin needed). My skin has never looked better. I will use this product for another 30 plus years! I love it!! Also, everyone has always complimented me on the fact that at my age I have no wrinkles (I am also a sun worshiper). I think that using Olay as long as I did (my mother used it as well!) really helped keep my skin looking great. Thank you Olay!!"
"Awesome product I waited several weeks before rating this product to make sure it was good for long term use. I have always had combination skin and was concerned it wouldn't work. It has been the product I've been waiting for. I wish I would've purchased Olay 7-IN-1 a long time ago. I have had problems with acne, oily skin, and areas on my cheeks that resemble rosacea. After using this product I am pleasantly surprised. Everything has improved dramatically. My husband has noticed the improvement. My mother in-law even noticed the rosacea areas on my cheeks clearing up. This is a great moisturizer from Olay! It's not too greasy, it really sinks into the skin when you put it on. All of the benefits are outstanding and all in one bottle! It is light and sinks into my skin nicely but does have a heavy scent. I've noticed my skin is softer and more even toned and I am happy I purchased this. I love almost everything about this moisturizer. It has great anti-aging ingredients, doesn't make me break out, and feels great under my makeup. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Best face cream I've ever used! I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I couldn't be happier. My skin looks amazing and I've had quite a few compliments about how good my skin looks! What I love: -How my skin feels - well hydrated, soft and smooth. -No dry patches after using this and I frequently get dry patches in our cold, dry Canadian winter climate. -My skin tone looks more even, less blemishes. -I sometimes get red blotchy patches but using this cream has definitely improved this issue. -I am pretty sure my crow's feet are less noticeable too! Negatives The only bad thing I have to say is that the ingredient list isn't super natural. I like to buy natural products with safe ingredients for the most part. This product has some ingredients I'd rather not be using. But honestly, for how good it is, it's worth it. Overall, awesome product and I will most definitely keep using it. It actually does what it says it will do, which I find with a lot of products is not actually the case... Disclaimer: I received this product as a trial through BzzAgent.

"Youthfully Eternal It was great to try Total Effects Anti-Aging Fragrance-Free Moisturizer. Particularly having low scent was great due to my workplace low scent policy. The moisturizer is also wonderful because it contains several vitamins to keep the skin supple. Fighting the 7 signs of aging is great and the skin conditioners within kept my skin hydrated all day. I have used Oil of Olay products twice daily for many years. I am 40 years old and receive many compliments about my skin. Often I am asked what I use. I found that this Olay product, Total Effects Anti-Aging is one of the best that Olay has created. I just wish I could purchase it in a larger size. The price is decent, however, for the amount you do receive. I'm very picky when it comes to skin care products. I'm a late night health worker, so I need a moisturizer that will also help with dullness and making it look energized and beautiful. Olay is the only drugstore brand I find that actually works and is worth buying. I definitely recommend this product and have encouraged many of my friends to begin taking care of their skin like I do. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Amazing surprise I was looking for to trie Olay Total Effects, waited a few days to be able to give my best opinion about it. And I'm amazed, with all the creams on the market this one is one that reaches the top.I love it,it does exactly what its saying. My sensitive skin recived a surprising hydration with out feeling oily or getting red spots.My skin feels like a baby's but and looks radiant.I felt the difference after the first application, and it got better after every day passing.This is now my product, and I will keep using it. Thank you for creating something that works,and helps to feel great. I have to get my boyfriend trie it out, he could use the hydration and help smooth his wrinkles to. Olay has created many fantastic products ower the years, but this one is one of the best. My mother uses Olay since I can remember, and if she can get this one in Switzerland I'm sure she will trie it to. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Found my new facial cream I think I'm in love, with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I was really excited to try this campaign because I was actually searching for a new facial cream. Let me just say, I used my entire sample and purchased a bottle for myself and also purchased some Olay gifts sets for Christmas presents... maybe an extra one for myself too. ) My face feels amazing. That is no exaggeration. It feels softer and smoother. No more mid day greasy feeling from my previous facial moisturizers. This cream goes on evenly without leaving any noticeable smudge marks. It's practically scent free which is nice. My skin tone does seem visibly smoother. I have combination dry and oily skin, so I have a hard time finding the right moisturizer. I have tried many. Very pleased with this new Olay product. You will be too. I will continue to use this moisturizer for as long as I can get it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I was sceptical of how this product was going to treat my very picky skin. I'm a feel person, if I can feel it on my skin, no thank you, I'll pass. I pumped out the lotion and put it on my face, instead of my regular product. I waited, wash cloth in hand, ready to wipe my face. I scrunched my face, waiting for the feel of a crust on my skin that would need to be wiped off immediately. To my surprise, that didn't happen. Oil of Olay left my skin feeling silky smooth and not greasy. It absorbed almost immediately. A week after I started using Oil of Olay, my skin felt amazing. The dry, dehydrated, Winter skin I had is gone and I'm left with a soft, fresh face. The smell was delicate and not overpowering. The pump design was fantastic. Pumps out the right amount and never clogged. I would highly recommend this product. The price is reflective of the quality of the product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This will replace my old cream its a keeper for sure I must say that I received Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer free from BzzAgent to try and I couldn't believe the difference in this product then my usual brand of face cream. This was so easy to use pump action is so great and it goes on so smooth leaving my face and neck feel moisturised all day and it is not greasy or does not cake or flake on your face. I noticed in just a shot period of time of using this product my face and neck look younger and I feel more better about myself when i have this product on. I told all my friends and family it is a must have. I know it will definately be replacing my usual brand of face cream. I can't wait until it is available in stores. To me it fights age spots and gives a nice healthy glow to the skin while moisturizing all day. I am so satisfied with this product. gotitfree This review was collected as part of a promotion.
The product works The product works because my sister used it for her ashy skin and it has gotten 100 percent better by increasing in texture and look.
"A case of mistaken identity! At a young 51 years old, fine lines and wrinkles have always been a concern for me. For years I used the ridiculously expensive brands from exclusive stores yet the price I paid for these products didn't erase them. My first 2 days with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 was a wonderful surprise! those fine lines were noticeably less and the more prominent wrinkles were softer looking. I was IMPRESSED! I am now about 2 weeks into using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 and the most amazing thing happened to me 2 days ago. I was out shopping with my 31 year old daughter and 3 of my granddaughters. My daughter left me with the 3 little girls so we were looking at pretty jewels. 2 ladies walked up to me and commented how adorable the little girls were then said to me, you must be so busy with 3 children. I looked at her and she appeared serious, she thought I was their mom! I told her I am their Nana but yes they are busy! BAM Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 obviously has dramatically fought the signs of aging! I encourage you to give this amazing product a try, you too may experience a case of mistaken identity! THANK YOU!

GREAT JOB I have love this product because it works wonders...
"Woozers I love it Thanks to the amazing program bzzagent and of course Olay, I GotItFree a 15 ml bottle of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer and I love it, I really miss it. I pumped out a small circle of cream out of that bottle each day for 5 weeks, and my skin felt warmer, brighter, tighter, softer, shinier, brighter, smoother, all around great. Now that I have been without it for 2 weeks I am really missing it, I can really see and feel a difference, my skin is duller, the shininess is gone, and it feels dry. I believe it is the vitamins they pack in it that give it such great moisture. I love that my face felt conditioned for an entire 24 hours, it's tone was much better, and it looked brighter than it does now that I have stopped using the cream. I am Definately going out to buy some more and I Would Absolutely recommend it to others. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Use it everyday for better results !!! I am 32 and started using this product 3 years back when I noticed my skin getting uneven skin texture, dark spots and unfirm areas with fine lines showing up on forehead and under eyes. I tried Olay Total Effects Daily Face Moisturizer and it worked wonders for me. It has a rich texture but is light on skin and gets absorbed easily, hydrating the skin best.I use it twice in morning and evening and it leaves my skin looking fresh,soft and radiant. It has also eliminated the uneven skin tone and dark spots from my skin and my skin now looks firmer. Biggest plus was that my skin lost all the fine lines and it prevents them from coming back.The scent is just right and the dispense works great if you want to control how much of it do you want.I love this product from Olay and highly recommend it, even to those who have sensitive skin.

"No Aging for me! I knew nothing at all about this product before I received it free from Bzz Agent. Total Effects Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer Fights 7 Signs of Aging: which are smooths fine lines and wrinkles, evens skin tone, enhances brightness, minimizes the look of pores, visibly reduces age spots, restores firmness and replenishes moisture. I wanted to try this because who doesn't want those things to happen for them as they get older. I tried it and I am really liking what it is doing to my face. My skin is firmer, fine lines and wrinkles are going away and my skin has moisture in it which is nice since it is winter now and I don't have the dry skin I usually get with winter. I have only been using it for about 3 weeks now and I can't wait to see what my skin will look like the longer I use it. Maybe people will mistake me for my son's sister lol.

"Olay total effects 7 I am really loving this moisturizer. It's perfect to wear under makeup or by itself. I have combination oily skin. So I get oily on my nose throughout the day. This kept my oil to a minimum I only had to blot once at work, which is amazing for me. It works really well under makeup, helped my foundation glide on smoothly without any steaks, also didn't cause my foundation to break up or become cakey . My skin is pretty sensitive and I was worried about breaking out. I didn't break out at all. It really did make my pores look better on my forehead and nose as well. When I wear it alone I definitely notice that my skin lookso smoother and gives a good amount of dewiness without making me look like a grease ball. I know that my local shoppers drug mart stocks this moisturizer. I believe it was between the 25-30 dollar range depending on the size you would like to purchase which is great compared to the higher end price points. It also doesn't have any kind of overwhelming scent which I LOVE. I don't need my skin care to double as a perfume haha I would highly recommend this to anyone and am 100 going to be repurchasing this in the future.

"My Review of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I think that OlayTotalEffects is the best and fastest to show remarkable results in just a few weeks of use that I have ever tried. I was so happy to be selected OlayUS BuzzAgent to get to try forfree Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I have been using this Olay skincare product faithfully for 3 weeks. I am so impressed with OlayTotalEffects for the following reasons: -I seen my fine lines and wrinkles diminishing -my skin tone looked more even and brighter -my skin seemed firmer and still soft to touch -age spots seemed to disappear -my skin was so well hydrated as well as moisturized Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is enriched with Vitamins like B3, B5 and also Vitamin E which help you to have a more radiant, brighter, smoother and more youthful appearance.

"Why yes....I am doing something different with my skin. I was very excited to get my sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Like most women I have a drawer full of half empty bottles of miracle creams that promise glowing youthful skin. Most of them you use for a couple weeks and see no improvement. I had used Olay moisturizers in the past but never any of the total effects products. Well, I'm proud to say, I'm hook, line and sinker with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. About 5 days after I started using it, I noticed my skin tone evening out, within 2 weeks the lovely brown spots, I inherited when I was pregnant with my second child, started to fade. My skin looks brighter and firmer. I also don't have to deal with ugly dry patches that tend to pop up on my forehead. The greatest part though, people have noticed. You look glowing! Your skin is so perfect! Yesterday, I was out at brunch with friends and one of them said what have you been doing with your skin! You look flawless. The biggest kicker was, I was wearing no makeup!! Of course, I raved about Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer....of course, with the results, who wouldn't!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay total effects WOW! I finally found something worth buying again. It really left my skin soft and moisturized ! My skin feels softer and younger also non oily. I've used it over a weeks so far and plan on using it every night. Ok, so I have super picky skin I have a wired skin thingy and I get rashes not sure if it's psoriasis or eczema but I actually didn't break out or anything, to be honest I think it sorta helped, not sure as to why ect. Also I am getting older lol, but my fine lines around my eyes and mouth era have been a little less visible. My face feels younger as I said a little more firm my little spots I had are less visible too! My skin tone even seems a little more even. I was iffy about trying Olay as well I figured it was just not any good as it comes from the drugstore and is not very expensive. But I think I've found my new cream.

"Now I know Why... Now I know why my Granny and even her Mama swear by the Olay brand! the second I took that first pump out of the bottle I was brought back to amazing memories of both the amazing ladies in my life. It smells like them! That is such an amazing thing for me. (Mainly because I do not handle sent well at all) This I SOO can! But wait there is more! I am almost 2 weeks into using this trile size bottle and have already gone to the store to see how much it will cost to get a full size bottle of the exact same product, when I run out. No product to-date for myself has hydrated and moisturized my face like this product. It last ALL day, with no need for reapplication. That alone is enough for me to be a repeat customer. I find I am having a bit of a glow to my skin as well. Not a bad thing with winter almost here. As for smaller pores and such I think it may be too soon yet but I plan to keep using to see what happens. Stay tuned and I will keep ya posted! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Best Moisturizer Ever!! I have used Olay products most of my adult life. I occasionally try other products but always come back to Olay. I have been using Regenerist Deep Hydration and the serum for the past five years depending on the season. Most of the year I use Deep Hydration. At almost 50 years old, people say I look like I am in my 30's. I beleive the Olay products play a big part in this. I will use Olay forever!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay 7 Total Effects used this anti- aging cream for almost two weeks now. I used the Olay 7 Total Effects in the morning and before bed. I found the highlights of this cream to be that it did not leave my face greasy, that I noticed a change in the smoothness of my skin, my face appeared more radiant, my pores went from very big to small medium in size and overall my skin looked supple and healthy. I was given compliments on the look of my skin by my boyfriend and that was an eye opener as we don't usually perceive men to notice such things. I have gone out and bought a full size bottle of Olay 7 Total Effects cream and have and will continue to use it in the morning and before bed. I would highly recommend this cream to anyone who may worry about a cream being to greasy as it did not clog my pores nor cause me any blemishes. I was impressed with the way Olay delivered it's product in regards to the improvement of my skin tone, increased radiance and shrinkage of my pores.

VERY IMPRESSED USING OLAY TOTAL EFFECTS 7 IN ONE ANTI-AGING MOISTURIZER So after further review of the Olay Total Effects 7 in one Anti-Aging moisturizer I have great results.

"I thought this was only for old ladies! Growing up I saw my Grandmother using Olay products and have always thought they were only for old ladies. I am shocked at the results I'm seeing on my skin! I've tried many moisturizers and creams and have not been able to find one that I've had real results. Well I have found it!! I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for 2 weeks now and at first I had my worries. I broke out for a couple of days and my skin felt very dry but once I got past that my skin has never looked so healthy! My skin is bright, moisturized and the skin around my eyes feels firmer. I've noticed the dark circles under my eyes lightening and the fine lines are disappearing. I have a deep wrinkle on my forehead and I have even noticed improvement there! I'm excited to see what the next 2 weeks will show! This product has truly surprised me and changed my opinion that it is only for old ladies skin. I will be changing my full routine to Olay products! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"1st try of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I just recieved my trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer today.(gotitfree) to try give a review. I tried it right away. Iwashed my face used 2 pumps of Olay's Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, while my face was stll damp, I put 2 pumps of Olays Moisturizer on my palms, spread it out evenly all over my face neck. I was totally amazed on how well it went on my face neck. This formula isn't sticky, doesn't have a strong scent, which faded away. My face didn't feel tight, my skin felt very soft. I also noticed my face looked a little brighter. So far I Love Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizing. I will continue usings Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Moisturizer over the next few weeks give another review. So far I highly recommed everyone trying Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Moisturizer, You'll be amazed as I was still am. A really great product! Give it a try. Thanks. :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love this moisturizer! I think that the Oil of Olay 7 in 1 moisturizer is awesome! I loved the consistency of the product, it was so light and felt great on my face. I loved the fragrance, it was fresh and not over powering. There is great value in this product as you don't need a lot to cover your face. A small amount is all you need to achieve great results. I was skeptical that I would be able to use the product as I sometimes have a sensitivity to some products, but I had not one problem with this moisturizer. Now that I have come to an age where I have to really start taking care of my skin and dealing with the issues that come with time, this is definitely a product I will continue to use. I noticed a difference with the fine lines around my eyes and how even my skin tone was. Friends and family really noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin and want to know what my secret was! This is definitely a must try a reasonable price for great results. Take a chance on the trial size and you will fall in love with the product and your skin again! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Results! So the first difference I have noticed with this product is that the very visible age spot on my cheek has been significantly reduced. This has been a source of embarrassment for me over the past few years, because it could not be covered by make up and I'm not that old!! It first appeared during my pregnancy 4 years ago and I never thought that it would go away. It's still not completely gone, but I feel that with regular usage, I could reduce it even further. I am SO thankful for this. I wish I had taken a before and after shot. I have not noticed it reducing my fine lines yet, but I expect that it will over time. The moisturizer itself leaves my skin feeling soft and supple during these cold winter days that can be hard on my face. I am super impressed with this product and will be sure to recommend it to my friends. Thank you Olay and BzzAgent for giving me the opportunity to test this great product for free, and for my improved face! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Reunited with Olay Total Effects Moisturizer I started using Olay Total Effects moisturizer when I was 35 years old that was many years past. I stopped 2 years ago since I was also experimenting on different kinds of brand i let go of it. Its not always included in my budget. The thing is once you reached the age of 40, you will notice fine lines, wrinkles, youthful skin no more. Since Bzz Agent offered me to try and review Olay Total Effects definitely its a yes! Its like seeing your long lost love and be reunited once more. When using the moisturizer gently pat it on your face, no rubbing please. It will penetrate more in your skin with its unique vitamin complex ingredients. The result is absolutely the same as it was before, reduced fine lines, even skin tone, youthful looking skin with a glow! I am now in need to get the full size bottle to make up with my lost years! I highly recommend it to the beautiful ladies who's life begins at 40! Be fabulous! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer Miracle worker I think that the Olay Effects 7 in 1 is a miracle worker. Like you , I've tried many different products and home remedies. None of those had worked for me. When I became pregnant a little over 2 years ago , I had the pregnancy dark spots on my face and my face was just plainly discoloured all over. My sleeping had gotten worse and the bags under my eyes had gotten even darker. I had swelled up so much that my skin started to sag. After having my son and my body got back to itself again, the nurses and doctor had assured me that my skin would return to normal and the dark spots would go away within a few months. It's been over 2 years and finally I've found a product to take away the uneven skin tone , reduce the colour of my dark spots that were supposed to go away , firmed up my skin , reduced the deeply embedded lines. If that wasn't a big enough bonus for me , I finally get to throw all my facial creams in the garbage and put that money to use elsewhere. Of course some of the money freed up will be used for Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisterizer the maricle product What can I say about olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisterizer, I have been using this lotion for almost 2 weeks now and I have to say I love it. Olay anti aging lotion has given me my life back. Five years ago I started getting bad acne on the left side of my face that wouldn't go away. I tried every acne product going even the popular expensive name brand product off of tv and nothing worked. I was really bummed out. BzzAgent gave me the option to join the olay total effects anti aging lotion campaign and I said what the heck what's one more product. Well to my surprise almost 2 weeks in and my acne is almost gone. Well if I didn't start crying because I thought that the left side of my face would never clear up. Olay 7 in one anti aging lotion has given me my life back, it is a miracle product and I highly recommend everyone who suffers from large pores or acne or any skin imperfections to try this product. I garentee you won't be disappointed. Thank you bzzagent and most importantly thank you olay for giving me my life back This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Awesome Product I have been using this product for years and even though you change the name in different products even my Dr. has said to me you haven't had a face lift as my skin is so soft and wrinkle free. I also think that genes, not smoking or being in the sun also helps your skin. However, you must have a product to smoothe over your skin before you apply make-up and that is why I am sold on all of the Olay products. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Standard that Stands the Test of Time Olay is a product that has always been in my house. My mother used it, my grandmother used and I have used it from a young age. It is a name that I know I can trust for reasonable prices and quality. Olay never gives my skin a reaction and always does what it says. This product is no different. Olay Total Effects 7 claims to visibly smooth lines and wrinkles which I believe that it does. It evens the tone of my skin which is does. I often have redness and this products calms that. It enhances brightness and makes my skin appear healthier. It mildly reduces the appearance of pores. It helps with age spots and firmness in my mom's skin and replenishes moisture. No, this product is not a miracle worker. You won't wake up with a new face, however, you can trust that your skin will be protected, moisturized and will not react. Olay is cost effective and easily accessible. I will continue to use this in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"7 thumbs up I have been using olays 7 effects for a while now. I can't say anything I don't like about it. The smell, the texture, the feeling best of all the results! I like how the unique vitamin complex helped to fight the seven signs of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone for me wrinkles aren't a big problem, yet! My big issues were redness and darker areas of my face. Both have improved emmeansly since trying this. Other people are noticing as well as myself. I wear a lot of makeup everyday, but at night using this cream has reminded me to take it all off and apply the cream before bed. I even think I like my skin so much more now that I might actually have to wear less foundation! My makeup feels nicer going on in the morning now that it has an even base to work with. The only tiny complaint I have is how small the trail bottle was, there's no way anyone can do the whole 4 week challenge using it ever night with that small bottle, so I guess the gimmick worked and I bought the full size to keep the good results going!

"Love this! I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a couple of weeks now. I loved it after the first day. It has a lovely soft scent to it and the pump that I was given with my free trial pumps out the perfect amount. I am 42 years old with 2 small sons so looking after my skin hasn't been a priority lately. So the difference when I started using it was big! Almost immediately I noticed that it evens out skin tone and restores firmness and my skin appeared brighter and healthier. I have combination oily and dry skin and often moisturizers result in me having a greasy face, however not at all with this product. There is the perfect amount of moisture restored using this. I haven't noticed any change in the appearance of the few age spots I have, however it has only been a couple weeks so I don't expect a miracle! lol. I look forward to continue using this product. I got it free, however I plan to buy it once my sample is all used up. Thank you BzzAgent for letting me try this product, what a great first product to try!

"Great product I have never tried Olay before but I am very pleased with this product! Me: I have sensitive-combo skin. Prone to blemishes and can be dry during the winter. The Product: This comes in a hygenic pump applicator. I have found one pump gives enough product to use on my face and neck. The cream itself is quite thick and took a little longer to soak in than others. It has a pleasant light fragrance. A little goes a long way. The first time I applied 2 pumps and was left looking a bit white and pale like I was wearing thick sun screen. One pump is plenty! Effects: I was very surprised at how gentle this is! When I first tried it I had a terrible cold and my nose was very sore / raw but when I applied this it didn't sting at all. It has got rid of my dry skin without leaving me feeling greasy. I've had no reaction and I can apply makeup on top of it without any streaks or smudges (as long as I let it completely soak in first). Overall: very pleased. It is light enough for you to forget you have it on but strong enough to keep your skin moisturised, soft and smooth. Thanks bzzagent get it free This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I've finished the bottle so now I'm off to buy more When I first started using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer, I liked it but I didn't love it. Now that I have finished using the trial bottle, I have definitely noticed a huge improvement in my skin and it looks so much better without makeup. My skin tone is much more even and my fine lines are less noticeable. It was especially helpful with my forehead wrinkles as they seem more plumped up. At first, I wasn't too happy with the scent of this cream but it really does grow on you. It smells very fresh and the scent eventually disapates so it's really not too bad. I love how easy it is to spread on my face as it has a light, smooth texture. I use this after my Olay Daily Facials and my skin feels like its been treated at a spa. I am very glad that I was able to try this Olay Moisturizer through BzzAgent as I love its effects and I will definitely be incorporating this into my skin care regimen.

"Amazing - Even On Sensitive Skin! I loved this stuff! My skin is ultra sensitive, but I found this moisturizer to perfectly compliment my combination skin type. All I needed was a tiny dab to perfectly nourish my skin. I loved how it really reduced my pores and evened out my skin. It even somehow seemed to reduce my oiliness! I wore it both alone and under my makeup, and it didn't melt like most moisturizers. It felt light and airy. I also liked that it didn't have any SPF in it. Some people swear by it, but I seem to react to it so it's nice to have that option. It also didn't make me break out in acne as most moisturizers tend to do. How I'd rate this: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles: N/A (no wrinkles on this face...yet!) Evens skin tone appearance: 5/5 Enhances brightness: 4/5 Minimizes the look of pores: 5/5 Visibly reduces age spots: 5/5 (no age spots, but my freckles could be comparable) Restores firmness: N/A Replenishes moisture: 5/5 Would I buy this When I did some research recently on the top moisturizers for my type of skin, Olay was up in the Top 5 so, YES, definitely!

"Anti agent marvel I think this moisturizer is a great one . Prior to using this my skin was pale and in need of a moisture boost and some lamination. This product gave me visible results and made my lines and wrinkles less defined and it gave my skin a radiant glow. The unique vitamin complex helped with fine lines , age spots and helped to even my uneven skin tone . I love the formulation and the easy pump formulation makes it great for easy application for daily use. I love that it applies smoothly and dries quickly and it is not greasy. I love that there is also an unscented formulation for sensitive skin such as mine . It is nice having a go to moisturizer that has 7 benefits all in one formulation . It is nice not having to use multiple products for multiple benefits . A must have in your beauty regime. A product that you will fall in love with and want the go to again and again for your moisturizing and anti aging needs This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 is FANTASTIC! I've been using my sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for one and a half weeks now, and I love it! My face feels smoother and softer. I never had very dry skin, but it is more evenly moisturized now. It goes on nice and smooth, not greasy or thick, but not runny either, and it has a pleasant, delicate scent, which lingers just long enough. The pump dispenser on the sample bottle dispenses an appropriate amount, too, so I can use a little on my neck as well. My skin tone seems a little more even...hard to tell, but I haven't been using it very long. I don't have many wrinkles or age spots (yet!), but using this product for longer may give better results to reduce the ones I do have! I already use Olay Complete face moisturizer with SPF 15 daily, but Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 is many, many times better. The sample doesn't have any SPF, so when it is available I will be buying the one that has sun protection. I don't use Facebook or Twitter or Pinterest, but I will be recommending Total Effects to my friends and family the good old-fashioned way! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay Olay...Olay Olay...hot hot hot! OK where do I start at this point in time I just turned 43 years old so I have a few different issues with my skin being age spots fine lines there's not too many products that I haven't tried... Most products dry my skin out very badly leaving red spots on my skin just burns being that it's so sensitive... Since I started using this product though I don't get dry skin from it or the itch or the burn it leaves my skin feeling fresh rejuvenated and very smooth to the touch! Which for me is a nice change being that I've been using the same product for many years now I have a new product to use it smells very nice the pump on it dispenses exactly what you want and need or use two pumps every time I've been using the product for seven days and I have seen a difference in my skin... I highly recommend this product and will continue to use it as part of my facial moisturizing! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Generational Beauty Regimen Even though the name has changed slightly, my mother who was born in 1917 used Olay products since it began. She always recommended to me which I began in my 20's and now at 67 never stopped using, even when other products have advertised being miracle product. This product has never stopped being my regular overall daily use. My mother (at 90) has no wrinkles. This is a product for all ethnicities. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Hooked!!!! Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer.. I was on the fence with it.. I wasnt sure it really did much for my skin.. Then i stopped using it for a couple days and my skin took notice! I hadnt realized but with it my skin stayed clearer, less oily, my pores were tighter and my skin as a whole just felt more firm. Im only 32 and have only a few lines so far but never really pictured myself using an anti-aging cream of any sort.. But I am now hooked.. Without the nightly moisturizer my skin changed so much for the worse.. My pores were more obvious and i started having a couple breakouts because my skin was becoming oily again. I definately reccomend any Olay product normally (i swear by the bodywash!) but this Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 has for sure earned a strong recommendation from me and is both fragrance-free and with sunscreen broad spectrum SPF 15.

"Suprised with Olay So, for someone who is a moisturize twice a day kind of girl, I though this would be the same old gimmick. I have always felt that as long as you moisturize, it really doesn't matter the product. Well, apparently I have been wrong. I actually can see a difference! I received and started Olay Total Effects on November 17 2015 and because I am going away (tropical) today, I felt I needed to take my after photo now as it wouldn't be right if I came back tanned hahaha. Anyways after 10 days I actually see (slightly) but still... a difference. Olay total effects took the fine lines and crows feet away. I am not sure how much this is in the store but I am actually going to buy a product I tried from BzzzAgent for the first time! I like the smell of the product, I LOVE the dispenser too! I am not sure what the value is at the store, but I do not even mind paying for it. Way to go Olay, I am actually impressed. I am sad I am almost out of the sample though :( Should have been a full size! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects Olay Total Effects is the best product! My brother dropped by to visit yesterday. No big deal right Well, he looked at me and looked at my face again...then he said hey, you look good!. I almost fell off my chair. He never has complimented me about my appearance. I have to say that I wasn't wearing a stitch of makeup either. I thanked him and then told him that I was testing a facial product for BZZ etc. Now, later that day, my sister-in-law dropped by with a couple of her friends. She came over to me and said Gee, your skin has such a smooth soft texture Di...what are you doing I explained to her and her friends about Olay Total Effects and about testing this for BZZ. They said that they all were planning to buy alot of Olay! I did mention to the ladies, that I applied Olay Total Effects at bedtime, feeling that the product worked best while sleeping and your skin is relaxed. I am extremely pleased with the results so far and plan to buy gallons of Olay Total Effects!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay's Miracle cream! This moisturizer is absolutely awesome! I have tried several anti-age products but this one is by far the best! It doesn't have a strong smell to it at all which is great. I don't like applying cream to my face and have a strong smell that I notice all day. It applies very nice, smooths out easily and absorbs very well.You don't need to use much product at all. It made my face feel so smooth and hydrated right away which is amazing because any other cream I have used doesn't do that. This moisturizer also helped with redness I get on my face every winter. I have noticed after about 3 days that the redness is much less.I noticed throughtout the day that my face is not drying out like it normally would during the cold days. My face would normally dry out and you could notice the dry skin but using the Olay Total Effects 7-in One anti-aging Moisturizer has had such a great improvement that my face stays hydrated much longer now.I love this product and would highly recommend it!

"Magic in a bottle I was sceptical to try Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer as so many companies have products that claim to do lots of things but then don't live up to their claims. I was pleasantly surprised when I first tried the Olay moisturising cream, it smelt really nice and felt great on my skin I decided to use it every morning underneath my make up as a base. I didn't see results straight away but after 12 days of using it I started to notice my skin was bright and smooth I don't really have fine lines right now but prevention is better the cure I think. After 17 days of using the Olay total effects 7 in 1 moisturizer I was sold my skin felt great and looked awesome. I was really pleased the moisturiser didn't make me break out like a few others ive previously tried, my pores looked smaller and my skin felt firmer. I really enjoyed using this Olay 7 in 1 moisturiser and went out and bought it in the full size when it ran out, this is my go to daily moisturiser now I simply love it This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Fighting Aging 1 Step (in 7) at a time I turned 40 this year...which means the fine lines, dark spots and dulled skin have started to appear. insert sad face here Thankfully BzzAgent and Olay have given me the opportunity to review Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for free, in exchange for my honest opinion of the product. My honest opinion I LOVE it!! I apply it in the morning after my shower and after my skin cleaning ritual in the evening. It is relatively scent free, which is great for those with scent sensitivity. It soaks into my skin in seconds. My coworkers have commented that I look younger (yay...I love my work peeps) which I attribute to Olay's claim of brightened skin The fine lines around my eyes and laugh lines around my mouth are barely visible after 3 weeks of daily use. The trial size of the product (available in stores soon) I was given has been used up, and I've already purchased the full size. This is a product I will continue to use. Thanks Olay and BzzAgent!!

"Surprisingly mattifying This moisturizer does a better job at keeping me matte than creams that are actually meant to mattify. I'm the greasiest girl I know, and my face is usually an oily disaster. This cream actually kept me matte for a couple of hours after application. Doesn't sound like a long time, but from my experience, having matte skin for a couple of hours is amazing. Even if this did nothing but moisturize, I'd purchase it. I'm not a fan of fragrance in my face products. Just a personal preference. The smell isn't offensive, just unnecessary in my opinion. I do have fine lines around my eyes and one sun spot (paying the price for being a pasty girl, spending too much time in the sun). I'll have to try out the moisturizer longer to see if it makes any difference to the sun damage and pores. The application is smooth and I don't get that there's something sitting on my face feeling. I did get two pimples after I started using this product, but I'm not sure if it's my serum or the moisturizer. Overall, good first impression. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Soft, smooth skin! It took me a bit of time to work up the courage to try something other than my tried and true routine, but I finally took the plunge. I was pleasantly surprised at the smoothness of application-the moisturizer went on smoothly and applied evenly. I didn't have to fight to get it to spread or go back for an extra pump of it because it absorbed too quickly. The scent is delicate but noticeable initially (there is a fragrance free option for those who are scent sensitive). I love that after I applied this moisturizer my skin felt velvety and soft but even better-that feeling lasted until the morning! It wasn't one of those 10 minute wonders that you put on and then wonder where it went!! Not this one! It stuck with me all through the night and left me with soft, smooth feeling skin. Can't wait to add this in to my routine and see the longer term results. I will post an update review once I have a little time under my belt with this so far great product!

"A month later, still love it! In my original review, I was planning on doing a side by side, before/after comparison. I have been using the product daily for 3-4 weeks, but unfortunately don't see significant changes that would warrant a comparison. To be fair, I had been using a Neutrogena anti-aging cream for several months before I got this campaign (and a different Olay face cream for years before that). Therefore, I don't think there was much 'reversing' that needed to be done. What it DID do was keep my face soft and moisturized all day and throughout the night, and maintained the 'work' that had been done for years before that. In other words, it's on par with the other stuff I already use. It bears repeating that it's light and fluffy, and smells delish so it may well be something that I switch to in the future (once my other products run out). As always, it will be dependent on price but the other lotion I use isn't cheap so that probably isn't hard to beat. It keeps its initial 5/5 stars :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I have used this product the last two years and have not been disappointed. People tell me that I look young and actually think I am lying when I tell them that I am 45. They all think that I am in my early 30's, it's an absolute compliment. Thanks to Olay!! I love all Olay products that I have tried since I was younger and have never been disappointed.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is AMAZING!! I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks now and I love it! Since I have been using the Total Effects, I have noticed that my skin is softer. It also appears to be a little brighter. The tone is evened-out, as well. I sometimes get a little redness around my cheeks and nose that has diminished drastically. I have some fine lines across my forehead that seem smaller now, especially if I moisturize before bedtime This is THE perfect product for my skin and age (40-ish.) It provides a light, non-greasy moisturizer, blends my pale/uneven skin tone into a nice healthy-looking color, and doesn't 'fill in' the crinkles wrinkles like a foundation does. I hope Olay never discontinues this fine product. The formula, with its VitaNiacin Complex, fights the 7 signs of aging and gently exfoliates your skin with vitamins B3, B5, C and E. This multi-tasking daily moisturizer gives you 7 skin benefits for younger, healthier-looking skin in 1 simple step by combining humectants and skin conditioners to help keep skin hydrated. Its vitamins and antioxidants defend against free radicals, help reduce the look of age spots, instantly minimize and refine the appearance of pores, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. This facial moisturizer nourishes with hydration to visibly reduce the signs of aging by subtly lifting the skin - enhancing and evening out skin tone for a more youthful appearence. This is Olay's simple, smart approach to younger, healthier-looking skin for life, combining: 7 benefits in 1 helps keep skin at its youthful radiant best VitaNiacin Complex, with vitamins B, C and E exfoliates to enhance skin's natural self renewal process for healthier-looking skin in 4 weeks Oil free and will not clog pores Fast absorbing, non-greasy formula 1 Brilliant Product: 7 Beautiful Benefits 1.

"very impressed I received a trial sample of Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer form BzzAgent for my honest opinion. I gave this product the ultimate test -- over the last 3 weeks (that was how long the sample bottle lasted) every night after removing makeup and washing my face, I used the Olay sample on my left face, while I continued to follow my normal skincare routine on the right. My regular routine consists of the following steps: 1) SK-II beauty essence (everyone who is of Asian descent will know of this premium Max Factor line from Japan), 2) Estee Lauder night repair concentrate and 3) finally finish off with a generous layer of Hada Labo Tokyo skin plumping gel cream (this is a very popular line from Japan for its hydrating power due to effective Hyaluronic Acid content). Since the Olay Total Effect Moisturizer claims to deliver the 7 anti-aging effects in ONE product, I have religiously stuck with this half face trial for 20 days to give it the ultimate test. I must say from the first morning off, I was pretty amazed that both sides of the face looked and felt pretty much the same. And this condition has lasted through all three weeks. I honestly cannot say the right side of my face where I have used 3 much more expensive products looks better than the other side. From a cost effectiveness' perspective, the Olay side doesn't only save 2/3 of my nightly skincare cost, it actually saves about 5-6 times of the cost because each of the 3 products in my routine is at least 2-3 times the price of Olay 7-1. On top of that, of course there's also the time-saving concern as I need to wait for one product to fully absorb before I layer on the next one. So needless to say, Olay 7-in-1 is a winner in that department as well. After the 3-week trial, I will for sure add Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Moisturizer to my regular nightly skincare routine. I will save the other pricier items (for which I still have a lot of faith) for those days when my skin needs some extra care and pampering! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total effects 7 In One Anti-Aging Moisturizer I will admit I was excited to receive this sample in the mail. I love to try new facial products but am leery about spending money on something if I'm not sure if I will like it-or if my face will like it. When I read the claims on the box I was skeptical. It just sounded like it was promising too much for one product to deliver. 1-Visibly reduce fine lines and wrinkles (haven't we all heard that before) 2-Evens skin tone and appearance 3-Enhance brightness 4-Minimize the look of pores 5-Visibly reduce the look of age spots 6-Restores firmness 7-Replenishes moisture I mean that's a lot for one product to deliver, right Well I've been using it for just over two weeks now and I admit, I have been pretty impressed. The first thing I noticed was the pump. Nice and easy to use and easy to control the amount you get-so you don't get too much and waste your moisturizer. Then the moisturizer. The scent was very light and not over-powering at all. I don't like a lot of scent and had no issues using this on my face at all. The consistency is great-not runny but not too thick either so it absorbs easily and quickly which allows for make-up to go on afterwards easily. But how did it deliver on it's promises My skin definitely looks smoother, more even in tone and it even looks like it's glowing a bit. Most days I don't wear any make-up and people who see me often-even my husband-are noticing the difference and have been asking what I've been doing that is different. The pores on my nose are definitely less noticeable which is great and appreciated. My skin looks moisturized but, with it being winter and cold and windy lately, I do have a small patch on my cheeks which needs a bit more moisture and I will have to start to do a bit more on that area for the winter. I can't comment on the age spot thing as I don't have any of those. So overall I would say that I am really happy with it and it has lived up to what they say. I didn't think that it would so I am happy to be proved wrong. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a really great Moisturizer and is very light weight formula and smells great, and goes on real nice and smooth, Not only did i notice a huge difference in my skin tone, but i noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and and forehead! This stuff really does work well, and it only takes a little amount of moisturizer and it spreads evenly and easily around your face. Not too oily or greasy just a great texture and smell. The unique vitamins complex really does work and i did notice results quite quickly ,and you will notice your skin brighten up and look refreshed and hydrated right after you apply it. It also does not irate my eyes or skin, like some moisturizer do. I loved this product so much that when i was done with my sample size that BzzAgent had sent to me complimentary to try and review, which was a good size sample i may add and i was able to see results with it. I went and purchased a full size bottle of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, a couple of weeks ago so i could continue to see results from the unique vitamin complex and continue to see results in my skin tone, completion, and fine lines and my skin continues to look refreshed and younger thanks to this amazing Moisturizer and believe i will continue to see results if i continue to use this moisturizer. I highly recommend this product ladies if your looking to help fight the seven signs of aging and looking to see results quickly at affordable price , from a reliable brand this moisturizer is a product you must purchase and try for your self. I also want to add that i'm not just saying this product works because i got the sample free i actually put my money where my mouth was and went out and purchased a full size bottle of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a great price and it's a great size,easily to dispense product and you really do see results fast and it's light enough on your skin that you can really use it every day.

"7 Effects in 1 Bottle Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer claims to help with 7 problems Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles, evens skin tone appearance, enhances brightness, minimizes the look of pores, visibly reduces age spots,restores firmness and replenishes moisture but does it really work and do all 7 of those things and does it do them all well I was given a trial size of this moisturizer by bzzagent and Olay to try the product and review it so I decided to try it for 2 weeks and see if it really works and does all the things it claims. I started using the moisturizer every morning either after I washed my face or as soon as I got out of the shower. After about 4 days of using it every morning I noticed that my skin looked brighter, felt and looked more firm and my skin tone looked more even, and at that point I decided I was really starting to love the way this moisturizer was making my skin look and I knew I had to keep using it to see if it was going to start helping with the other 4 areas it claims to help with as well. A few days later, after about 7 days of use, I noticed that my skin looked and felt more moisturized then it used too and that the dry flakey skin I usually have around my nose, that no matter what I haven't been able to get rid, was no longer then and was actually moisturized now. After about a week and a half I noticed that my pores looked smaller and that I didn't have as many pimples as usual, which was a bonus for me because who likes to likes to have pimples, especially in their mid 20's. At this point I was in love with this moisturizer because it was doing more then I thought it would and making my skin look and feel great. I don't really have a lot of wrinkles or fine lines (I know we all like to think we have none) but I do have a few and this moisturizer helped reduce the look of them and made it so I couldn't even notice some of them anymore. I don't really have any age spots so I cant say how it works on them, but based on how it worked on all the other problems I have I have no doubt that it would work great on them as well. So does Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer really work and work well at that I would have to say yes! And I am going to continue this routine and will recommend this moisturizer to anyone who asks or anyone looking for one to try. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smooth and flawless! Okay so I have been using Olay Total Effects for a few months and can really see the difference in my skin. I have almost forgotten what my skin used to look like I had more visibly obvious fine lines and my pores were definitely more obvious. I was really surprised to look back at old pictures and see that I definitely have more fine lines around my eyes my pores were definitely more obvious and my general skintone was less even. I didn't think using Olay total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer was really that much difference than all the other facial lotions that are on the market. I am so used to seeing commercial after commercial about different creams that claim to have all these extravagant benefits but after trying them they all seem to be the same, unlike Olay. I spent quite a bit of time over the holidays with friends and relatives that I have not seen it in a while almost all of them commented not only on how healthy and generally well that I looked but also that my skin seemed flawless and rejuvenated. As always, the first question that comes up is what have you been doing eating or not eating that has changed your appearance so much, and as I told all of them my new secret Olay. I told him all about the benefits of the reducing the size of my pores, removing the small fine lines, evening out my skin tone, and generally giving my skin a youthful glow. They all know I am a Bzz agent so of course there next question is do you have any free samples as I usually do when I am part of a campaign. They were very disappointed to know that I only got one bottle of this uber's special cream. I told them from my experience that I have seen this product go on sale fairly regularly and told them I will let them know next time I see it's on sale. So in closing, I will definitely continue to use Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer, even if it is not on sale, which says a lot about me. So thank you again Bzz agent for letting me be a part of this fabulous campaign and once again trying a new product that I possibly wouldn't have purchased otherwise and am now a big fan.

"So Amazed with the results in just 4 days I started using anti aging treatment since i was 30 yo to ward off wrinkles and dull skin , I've tried other products and kept on trying because I haven't found the right one yet ,i am glad i got to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer .It came in a nice shape plastic bottle with a pump which is good because it pumped out small amount enough to cover your face and neck, no wastage compared to those ones in a bottle and cap where you pour too much or squeeze too much in a tube , or in a jar where you scoop lots and waste some. Olay Trial bottle contains 15 ml , not sure how long will it last but definitely i will continue using it as my everyday thing because of its visible results in just 4 days . On my first try , i pressed the pump halfway and get a good amount ,enough for my face and neck , i like this best because i can control the flow and decide just in case i need more, its consistency as i feel it on my finger feels even and smooth,it has a subtle fragrance just enough to make you feel clean and fresh,which i like because i dont want anything too smelly on my face. I applied it on my face down on my neck evenly using an ample amount and the first thing i notice is it doesn't leave a greasy feeling nor looking oily after awhile unlike my other moisturizer.I observed it on my face all day and there is no signs of oiliness at all , my face looks firm and i am even blushing all day , it feels smooth and i can feel the dryness and tightness disappear , the vitamin content is really working. I cant help staring at the mirror of every shop i went through as i went shopping that day , at this early i can see my face is glowing indeed and feels soft to touch. I also applied it before bedtime it feels like you are not wearing anything on your face at all , so light and when i wake up you can still feel the smoothness and i can see my pores closed which is another thing because of my type of skin .As i washed my face in the morning i didnt get any residue at all ,my pores are tightened , i was totally amazed as i notice my white heads are gone and my pores are minimized , I can say at this early that my skin feels firm ,even and moisturize. Fine lines under my eyes are less visible. This product works so well without leaving any signs skin irritation like itchiness and redness as it doesn't contain any harsh chemicals . It met my expectations so far ,Cant wait to share this to my friends and i will also recommend this to younger group because of its vitamin b complex content as it reduces facial oil and minimize formation of acne . I will post an update soon as i cant wait to see those fine lines under my eyes and age spots to totally disappear. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Impressed! In my first review I had only been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about two weeks and the only improvement I thought I had seen, was the skin on my face and neck felt softer. How ever, there was more of an improvement to my facial skin than I first thought there had been in this short amount of time, I just hadnt noticed it myself. It took my sister in-laws to point out to me that the dark spots that had developed on my forehead from the summer sun had also disappeared. At first I didnt believe them and I had to get up and take a good look for myself, but sure enough they were all gone! Seeing this made my sister in-laws go out and each buy a bottle of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer the minute they left my house and they tell me their both loving it and theyre both beginning to show improvements as well. As for myself, I still really like that you only need one pump of the bottle to get just the right amount out of it, thus youre not wasting any of the product. I love how quickly it blends into my skin and Im still pleased with how fast the little scent that it does have, fades away quickly. Aside from those wonderful aspects the thing that has sold me the most about this product are that it works! The little lines that were around my eyes and mouth arent near as noticeable as they had been at the beginning of this trail and from what I can tell the longer I use it, the more improvements Im achieving. I really cant say enough about how fast it was able to transform my skin from dull, dry looking and dotted with dark spots, into skin that looks and feels softer, is smoother and brighter and just over all refreshed looking! The question is, has using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for four weeks turned back the hands of time ten years Well Im not so sure about ten years, but it definitely has improved my facial skins over all appearance and Im extremely happy about that. Ill definitely continue to use Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and with any kind of luck, those hands of time will also continue to fall back. How far they will fall and how fast is anyones guess, just as long as they keep going in the right direction Ill be happy to buy more Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Being able to do this trial has also convinced me to give more of the Olay products a try and I cant wait to see the results I hope to also have with them. Oh and Id also like to add that Ive heard back from well over half of the women Ive spoken with about Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. They all have reported to me that they are also loving not only using the product, but loving the results they are all starting to achieve. Id like to thank BzzAgent and the makers of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for giving me the opportunity to try this wonderful product and for allowing me to inform others about it. Its been a pleasure, thank You! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Visibly reduce age spots 6. Restore firmness 7. Replenishe moisture In terms of how Olay Total Effects looks, smells and feels, this is what I found. It has a light floral scent that is pleasant yet subtle it has a soft, smooth, and non-oily/non-greasy feel that quickly and easily absorbs in the skin making skin feel super-moisturized right away it looks matte on skin when applied and makes skin look nourished and soft to the touch. Most importantly, Olay will not clog your pores. I'm very pleased with the results I've gotten from this moisturizer. I had previously been using an other anti-aging products with little or no visible improvement to my complexion. I was disheartened by spending money on beauty products and after months seeing MINIMAL results. Thankfully, I received a sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer from BzzAgent to try and review. This is the best all-around anti-aging moisturizer I've ever used, truly targeting 7 skin aging problems. I recommend this product to anyone without reservation. Whatever aging signs you see in the mirror, Total Effects has a solution for all your skin's imperfections. THE OLAY PROMISE: Younger, healthier-looking skin that stands the test of time.

The results are fast and clearly visible. At 53 yrs of age on a tight budget, this is my one and only from now on, I'm done experimenting, I've found the best product and the greatest value with Olay. This cream is light, it absorbs quickly and completely and leaves my skin feeling smooth and looking renewed. What more could you ask for This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Bring on the fountain of youth There is nothing more exciting than opening up your mailbox to find you have a new BzzAgent box with a product to sample and review. The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer arrived and certainly got me excited to try it! I was so excited to try it (and test it on my skin type) that I sampled a bit on the back of my hand first. Now, I will admit (Sigh) I'm gently approaching 40 and my hands are now less than perfect. I just had to give the cream a try somewhere, and my hands were just right there screaming out...help me! I was so impressed with just one application on my hand in comparison to my other hand I was almost tempted to do a trial on just my hand to show the difference! (But then I though...eeke....one hand would look soooo good and the other would still look so, well, spotted and older, best wait till I purchase a full size to correct that later on) I did use the sample size on my face and within a few days noticed my face seemed to be glowing, almost brighter. The texture of the cream is so smooth and goes on like velvet and has a pleasant light scent to it. With combination skin, this cream worked well for me as it didn't over do my oily areas or leave my dry areas in need. I can't say for sure in a week that my pores are any smaller, I will be able to tell more by following through with the purchase of a full size bottle. I can say that it was helping with the age spots on my hands (I know, I know...I'm reporting on my face...but whatever leftover cream I had I used from applying on my face I rubbed all over the back of my hands....let me tell you how fantastic it was to see a reduction on those ugly little spots! Whatever works right) My skin is feeling fresh and great with using the Olay total Effects 7 in 1 and I do recommend giving it a try if you are looking for a new face cream full of vitamins to help you fend off aging and age spots as well as uneven skin. Going towards 40 will be a breeze now! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Completely Love it!! I honestly can't say enough good things about this product, I Will say that I wasn't impressed with the size of the product that was sent to me, it was not big enough to even begin to give a real judgment or be able to to help with the product worked or not because I just didn't allow enough product for a long enough period of time for testing. However I enjoyed texture the smell the feel of this product on my skin, how well it absorbed into my skin how it didn't leave it feeling oily or greasy, there was absolutely no residue. I had no negative reactions to this product whatsoever. I do like the Olay brand and products. I have use them for quite a few years already, I have never tried this particular line of products from Olay. So I decided to re-purchase on my own and continue using it, I am very impressed with the results I've seen from this product I do feel that my skin has firmed up, I do feel that it looks rejuvenated and healthy, as far as the fine lines and wrinkles I'm kind of thinking that they are perhaps fading a little bit . I do feel that this product is making a difference towards the luck and health of my overall skin, I will continue to use it. I like the packaging, I think it's sleek and easy to use it's nice looking, I also like the fact that this product comes in with sun protection and it also comes in scent free formula those people who do not like scented products. Olay products are very readily available, they are reasonably priced compared to some of the other antiaging products out there, I would highly recommend this product line to anybody who is looking for a good affordable high-quality readily available antiaging product. I Feel like you get a lot of good bang for your buck with this product ! A very good buy! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

The Greatest I'm a 56 year old female former smoker with a lot of wrinkles around my mouth and the corners of my eyes. I started using Regenerist Deep Hydration Cream years ago when I took a good look (instead of a glance) at myself for the first time in quite a while. After the first month I noticed a big difference in the appearance and texture of my face and a lot of the small wrinkles were gone. I was thrilled. I've tried other products but always go back to Olay. It works for me.

Goes on smooth and even.. Well first time I put it on I knew it was a keeper. It went on so smooth and even and was t greasy.

"Best Product...Ever I have been using Olay products for many years. When I was in my 20's I mainly used it for the moisturizing effects. Now that I'm in my 40's I very much appreciate the extra help with aging. Their were many times when I didn't have the extra cash and I tried something a little cheaper. Needless to say, I was never happy with the effects I received. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Thank you Olay, we will be together for many more years to come.

Camera softness from a bottle! The very first use left my skin glowing. Did not like the dispenser because it pumps too much product out if you forget to gently tap it. I gently tap product into skin after wash skin and my skin feels like velvet and glows - no matter how much sleep I had- I get compliments on how great my face skin looks.

The best moisturizer that I have used I think that the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is an amazing product. I loved the trial sized bottle so much that I shortly after purchased a full-sized bottle. Lightly scented and extremely moisturizing without feeling greasy. It's my new favourite facial moisturizer.

This is my favorite moisturizer I have tried many different moisturizers but none of them were as good as Olay. Olay is priced more reasonably than other products and works better than the more expensive products. I have used your products for many years and am often told that I don' look like I am almost 63 years old. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"You will never go back! It is a great product. I am totally going to make it party of my beauty routine. It does not feel heavy and oily. I have used the product as part of my morning and evening routine for the party week and can see the results. Don't take my words, try it and you will also make the switch!

Great effect. This product makes you feel so comfy. Anything that makes you skin more vibrant and slows down the aging progress is a blessing.

"I knew it worked, but didn't know how well.... ...until we traveled to Colorado. Living in a high humidity area, dryness isn't something we worry about too much. But when we went to visit friends where it's dry, I noticed fine lines. After I put on the deep hydration cream, they seemed to go away almost instantly! Great product!

"Great moisturizer for humid climate I live on the coast of the Southeast U.S., which tends to be both hot and humid, especially during the summer months. Finding a moisturizer that will work both to hydrate my skin and protect it from sun damage without feeling and looking greasy is a challenge, but this is that product.

"This poduct tatal effects 7 is amazing Just started to use this product again after trying other brands and I seem to finally realize that Olay is the product for me due to the non greasy feeling,.smells great and works great on my skin."
"Very Nice Product I'm a bit of a makeup and cosmetics junkie. I have probably every cream ever made, and then some. I love trying new products and find ways to fix issues that I see every day staring back at me in the mirror. I was obviously very excited when I saw a BzzAgent Campaign for an Olay Cream. I have always loved Olay, and have tried many of their products, so this was a no brainier for me to try. When I received the product I was excited to try it, the packing was so cute and functional. I always shudder when I get cream in a container without a pump, as I worry about the hygiene of the cream after dipping my fingers into it daily. I was very glad to see a pump on this bottle, as that way I never have to worry about the cream being dirty after months of use. In terms of the product itself, the cream feels smooth and luxurious, and when you put it on your face it blends in really easily. I hate when creams lie on your skin, and you feel almost wet after applying - none of that here. Your skin feels almost instantly smooth and primed. I really liked the smell. It's got that classic Olay smell, that always reminds me of my mother. I just love that smell! In terms of it's anti-aging abilities, I have actually noticed a difference in how smooth my skin feels. I blessed to not have super oily, or spotty skin, but in the winter I often get very flaky skin on my face. I have noticed that since I have switched to the Olay cream this hasn't been as much of an issue as previously. In terms of buying the product again, I totally would, but I would be more inclined to by the version with SPF as I have very fair skin, and any added sun protection to my face is always a bonus.

"I totally loved this moisturizer This Moisturizer is true to its name, younger looking healthy skin, made my skin look smoother, replenished the moisture, and made me feel great! This is a must try moisturizer. It is not greasy and it moisturized my skin all day. I loved this product thanks Olay and BzzAgent for the sample to try GotItFree This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Oil of Olay 101 It's got a nice smooth texture and leaves skin smooth! It's a great moisturizer. As far as wrinkles go, it helps with fine lines around the eyes! I have sensitive skin, and didn't react to this cream! As far as I'm concerned, it's a product that is well priced and I have no problem going out and getting a bottle! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This product really works! Before I used the daily moisturizer my skin was dry and cracked my the end of the day. Now, my skin is much smoother and others have noticed. I am 62 years old and a registered nurse. I work long hours. I apply the Total Effects moisturizer before I put on my makeup, and my skin is smooth for 12+ hours! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I think I'm in love I think that this product is amazing! I am always a little sceptical of trying new creams because I don't like change but I'm glad I tried this! My skin is feeling and looking so smooth. And, there is no greasy feel and residue that I feel under makeup. And the bonus, it's making my skin younger by the minute :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Amazing try it I like this product alot I have really sensitive skin and this one broke me up but that's how my skin is so no big deal I think it's a bit pricy but it does give u what it says it gives u.

Amazing results This is now my permanent 'tool' for fighting the signs of aging. I have found that my fine lines are almost impossible to see and my skin seems to glow as my husband puts it. It doesn't feel as dull as it did and my skin tones are no longer. Thank you Olay for a powerful product in one bottle This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Keeps getting better! I really like this moisturizer. From the first time I tried it, I was impressed. Then after the 30 days of using Regenerist Regenerating cream in my daily routing the results kept getting better. The results are soft, glowing, and moisturized skin. I really like this cream.

Nice touch Took a shower after exercising and then applied the lotion on my face after cleansing and it felet awesome. Olay anti aging facial lotion keeps me away from dry skin. This is especially good when during the winter. Even suitable for people under 40 s to use it. Always good to care the skin from aging. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great for Oily Sensitive Skin I have used this moisturization every morning for a month now. I wear it under my primer and foundation. I have had no breakouts. It was very cold and my skin was so dry this cream arrived just in time! I am just about at the end of this sample and I have to go out and buy some more. Love this stuff!!!!

"Smooth like a glove I never used Olay total effect before, I have been using the product for five days and already see the difference, my skin is smoother and feel less dry.

Olay Total Effects I found the fine lines around the eyes seemed to be fading giving a smoother look. I believe with continued use most fine lines on my face will fade to a much smoother and even appearance. This moisturizer left my face feeling soft and smooth. Love this product and will continue to use it daily. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"First time putting it on... OK so first day putting it in and my face feels soooo nice, must say I thought would be greasy but I was wrong! It's so light and smooth!!

"Olay 7 total effects This product is an all around good product. Moisturizing and anti- aging all in one little bottle! This product is a light, non greesy moisturizer.

"I Loved Total Effects Moisturizer! I really appreciated its discreet scent. I see that my skin is softer than before, with an healthier tone. However, since I'm only 28 and do not have wrinkles yet, it's hard for me to say if it really works for this... But I would certainly recommand to my friends and ciblings that are older than me to try it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Awesome moisturizer Being a Sensitive Skin Gal I was very hesitant to try this moisturizer. I love it. A little goes a long way! The moisturizer does not feel greasy or heavy.

This products does what it promises Years ago I came across a Good Housekeeping product review at a time when I was looking for a good moisturizer. The product was Total Effects.

"Love it, feels like silk!! I am loving Olay total effects seven in one anti-aging cream. It is so light weight silky and smooth and makes my skin feel fantastic. It is so hard to find a cream that combines all the benefits of an anti-aging cream in a nice light moisturizer most are heavy, cakey and leave a film on your skin, but no Olay's!!

Magic in a bottle I have used many different moisturizers and this BY FAR is the best. I have combination skin oily around my noise and dry in the t zone. But this face lotion works PERFECT. Its also helped with my breakouts I literally don't breakout anymore. I'm so happy with this product and I'll continue to buy it. 100 worth the cost.
"Olay is tha bomb! I think this product is genius! It smells great, goes on smooth, blends well and makes your skin feels so soft. I normally have rosy cheeks so I always look uneven. But with the Olay anti-aging cream I find my skin is even in tone now. My fine lines have slowly disappeared. My skin is so soft, I highly recommend it!

"Olay you made my day! I think that I'm in love with OlayUS! GotItFree and have been using it for 2 weeks! Already my skin is tighter, my pores are smaller and my skin tone is improving!

The results are obvious! I have tried several Olay products in the past and was excited to try this new version. I applied it twice a day. I was told on two separate occasions in the last week that I look like I haven't aged in years. My skin is definitely more hydrated and plumper. I look forward to continuing with Olay as part of my routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Moisterizer I love this. Tried it once before and it left my face feeling smooth and not the usual dryness. However, before I could finish the jar, my daughter liked it so much, she took it home with her!! Need to try again!"
This Product Works Well This product works well because my skin is beginning to look great and feel great
"Great Moisturizer I've been using this product for a week and have already noticed a difference. My skin is clearer, brighter and fresh looking. I can't wait to try other products from this line."

Why Is It Scented?!? I couldn't get past the first day of the free trial challenge. I don't understand why there is a perfume fragrance in this. I can't wear it without my eyes watering - my nose keeps running and I keep sneezing. This would have been a wonderful product if it weren't for all of the unnecessary scents that smell like cheap perfume. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"I Really Wanted To Like It I wanted to like this so much, the smell I could not take, it smells way too strong and I had to wash it off after 10 minutes. My skin felt really soft but I have problems with smells of any brand. Wish there was a non scented and I would use every day, Sorry! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Feels Very Heavy On My Face The Entire Time It Was On, This product felt heavy when I first applied, that freshness I was expecting never arrived and the heavy feeling stayed with me. I was very disappointed. I did my normal facial cleaning and the feelings of heaviness was still there. I had to do a deep cleanse before that feeling left my face. I do not recommend this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Did Not Notice A Difference Received the 14 day sample and Im glad I didnt pay for the product. Did not notice a difference after 14 days and I found the scent of the product too strong.
Very Heavy And Too Much Perfume I bought this today very excited from the reviews I read...only to be very disappointed... It is too heavy and actually feels like it's weighing my skin down and the fragrance is very strong!! I usually buy expensive skin care products however I just found a drug store foundation that I just love!! So when looking for a new firming foundation I was hopeful this product would be great as well. Not the case at all... I usually don't write reviews but had to with this one. DON'T BUY!!
Revitalift I tried the 14 day challenge and not for me no change
"Super Sticky And Made Me Breakout... I was not a fan of this. At first glance, the consistency looked moisturizing and refreshing. I liked the smell, it's like a nice perfume. But, as soon as I dabbed my finger into the pot, I was struck by how sticky it was. And putting it on my face did not change my opinion. It took some effort just to get the stuff to spread over my face. I should have immediately washed it off, but I didn't. I gave it a chance to work on my face overnight, and, boy, did it do a number on my face. HUGE cystic acne all over my chin and lots of tiny milia along my cheekbones the next morning. Very unhappy. Very surprised, too, because I love a number of L'Oreal's Paris products. I love their Revitalift glycolic facial scrub and their Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Serum. I will be using both plus an AHA lotion from a different company just to get my face to clear up. Shame this didn't live up to how great those other two products are.

Its a very great product My sissy gave me the product 3 yrs ago to try and am so lost with out it .i feel my skin apperence has become that of a 23-year-old. Women and i get many compliments on how young i look. 54 yrs old skin amazing and wrinkle free as far as i can see look and feel great..
"Did absolutely nothing I used this product each day as instructed, even for a few extra days. I noticed nothing different about my skin."
"Fragrance is UNnecessary My skin felt like it was on fire after using this product. Two days later, my face is flaking"
"I wanted to love it I like the smell of the moisturizer in the jar, on my skin is another story! I've been using for over 2 weeks now and don't notice any difference in texture, firmness or fine lines. I do, however, notice that when I use this, my face and neck smell like eggs :( I'm not sure if it's some sort of chemical reaction or what, but nothing else I use does this to me. Not sure if I will continue to use it because it doesn't do what it's supposed to do and leaves my skin stinking!!"
Not good for sensitive skin! Unfortunately I didn't like product. As someone who has very fair and sensitive skin the fragrance bothered me. Otherwise the product was fine as a basic moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Not for me! I did not like this moisturizer. I believe it caused me to break out. There must be something in it that i am allergic to or did not sit well with my skin. I will not be using it again! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Not for me The first thing I noticed was there are so many silicone ingredients in all of the products. The second thing I noticed was how lotion like it was, not serum feeling like all other serums I have used. The third thing I noticed was how extremely fragranced it was. So I tried it.

"unexpected breakout! At my age, blemishes have been replaced by wrinkles. I was surprised after using this product for a few days that I started breaking out on my neck and cheeks.

"Too oily for my skin! I have very sensitive skin and tried the deep-acting facial moisturizer for over a week now. At first I really liked it because all you need is a dot to cover the entire face. It glides on smoothly! However, after using the product for a week, at night only (even though the packaging says to use it every morning and night), I have broken out and wake up with a greasy face. Gross! Unless you like feeling like you just put butter all over your face, I would not recommend the deep-acting moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Unfortunately not for me Unfortunately this L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is not my favorite product. I used it in combination with the Serum and the Daily Facial Moisturizer from the same line. First of all, I found it difficult to understand the order I should use the products. After much reading, I think I figured it out. I used this deep moisturizer every night for a week because I was trying to I've myself time to adjust. But that's all I could handle. It made my skin feel irritated and hot for a few hours after application. Also, the smell, although not unpleasant, was too strong for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Definitely not a win I was super excited to try this, as I've never actually had a skin care process, and I typically like L'Oral. But this stuff is awful. I washed my face in the shower with my normal stuff and then read all the directions. My first disappointment was in the directions. They focus on all the other L'Oral products to use, highlighted, and order specific, but give you no idea as to how much to use. A drop Dime size A gallon No idea. So I used the serum, waited a bit for it to soak in (though I was unsure if I should or not because the directions didn't say either way) and then applied the moisturizer. I think I used too much (again, directions) and felt like I was rubbing it in forever. It wasn't thick like it looked, just felt like a lotion. Stunk like a chemical storm. And actually just sat on my face. No matter how much I rubbed, it never soaked in. I could feel it there all day long. It also burns. And then my face got all red. I used the whole routine (serum, moisturizer and sunblock) 3 times before I decided I couldn't do it anymore. It stinks, it burns, it makes my face red. And worse, when I did it all and then applied makeup on top, it all literally rubbed off. Which means it was all just sitting on my face not soaking in. I felt it all day. All over gross.

"Regenerist This is the best product on the market, I started using Olay products after being told that you should start early taking care of your skin. I was 35 (now 52) and started getting complements on my skin right away. I am still getting those complements, and I am asked what I use. When I tell them about the several Olay products I use daily they tell me that I could do a commercial because they thought I was wearing makeup. I have been sing the praises of Olay from the rooftops. I love my Olay and wouldn't use anything else even if it were free! I look forward to any new products Olay has to offer.

"Super sticky and made me breakout... I was not a fan of this. At first glance, the consistency looked moisturizing and refreshing. I liked the smell, it's like a nice perfume. But, as soon as I dabbed my finger into the pot, I was struck by how sticky it was. And putting it on my face did not change my opinion. It took some effort just to get the stuff to spread over my face. I should have immediately washed it off, but I didn't. I gave it a chance to work on my face overnight, and, boy, did it do a number on my face. HUGE cystic acne all over my chin and lots of tiny milia along my cheekbones the next morning. Very unhappy. Very surprised, too, because I love a number of L'Oreal's Paris products. I love their Revitalift glycolic facial scrub and their Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Serum. I will be using both plus an AHA lotion from a different company just to get my face to clear up. Shame this didn't live up to how great those other two products are.

"Feels very heavy on my face the entire time it was on, This product felt heavy when I first applied, that freshness I was expecting never arrived and the heavy feeling stayed with me. I was very disappointed. I did my normal facial cleaning and the feelings of heaviness was still there. I had to do a deep cleanse before that feeling left my face. I do not recommend this product.

"Too Heavy, Too Scented I have only been able to use this product a couple times because it is such a heavy moisturizer that it leaves my skin feeling so clogged and slimy that i don't feel comfortable wearing it to bed. I feel like i'm going to wake up in the morning with breakouts because it's so heavy on my face. If you're looking for a super hydrating, moisturizing mask of sorts then this may be what you are looking for. But if you're looking for an overnight moisturizer that sinks into your skin then this is not what you need. Plus this moisturizer has a heavy perfume smell which makes it to where my husband will not even try it. I'm sure some people love this moisturizer. However, it's just not for me.

"Gunky mess I had high hopes for this moisturizer but it fell flat for me. It smelled great and went on smoothly, however, after a while if I rubbed my forehead or cheek part of the product would peel off. Furthermore, my pillowcases were stained from this moisturizer and I did not even put much on! I tried it for two weeks, day and night, and I only observed that my skin was slightly more mositurized. However, it also gave me more breakouts. I know it gets great reviews elsewhere but for me, it just did not work. I also wish it had SPF in it since it says to use it in the morning as well as the evening. I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. contest"

"Fragrance Is Unnecessary My skin felt like it was on fire after using this product. Two days later, my face is flaking"
"I Wanted To Love It I like the smell of the moisturizer in the jar, on my skin is another story! I've been using for over 2 weeks now and don't notice any difference in texture, firmness or fine lines. I do, however, notice that when I use this, my face and neck smell like eggs :( I'm not sure if it's some sort of chemical reaction or what, but nothing else I use does this to me. Not sure if I will continue to use it because it doesn't do what it's supposed to do and leaves my skin stinking!!"

"Leaves Strange Residue L'Oreal Revitalift Triple Power day/night Cream has a nice smell and it's not greasy however it leaves a very strange residue on my face and neck especially near my hairline and ears, no matter how clean my face is and no matter how lightly I try to put it on. After it is completely dry it will literally ball up if I rub my fingers over it. I'm not sure if I'm explaining it correctly. Its good night cream, but there's no way this would work under make up during the day. It is globby on its own with nothing over it so I can't imagine putting make up over it. I've been using it now for a week so I have not had to go anywhere and use make up but I wouldn't try it. I've not seen any positive changes to the appearance of my skin. I was really hoping to like this cream because of the great price but because of the strange residue it leaves, I will not purchase again."

"Revitalift 2 Week Sample Trial At first try, I loved the product. Felt smooth on the face. A little heavy for my preference. After a day or so, makeup was not able to stay on all day after using this product. I even tried less product and only at night but makeup would slough off like puty in my hand. Will be trying the serum to see if that works better for me. Wish they had samples of the serum to try. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Smell Not Quite My Favorite The quality of this moisturizer is great and my face felt great after using it. The one reason I would not buy this product is the smell.

"Revitalift Triple Power Not For Me I received a 14-day sample of this product from L'oreal (RevitaliftChallenge). Although the product feels great is rather moisturizing, there is residue left only a few hours after applying (too thick of a formula for me, perhaps). I also have not noticed any changes in skin appearance. I'm sure that many others like this product, but it's not for me. I do, by the way, absolutely love L'oreal RevitaLift Double Lifting Day! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Moisturizes Well! I had a free trial of this moisturizer and after it was over, i can only say it made my skin moisturized better than it normally is. The fine lines and blemishes are still noticeable, and it burned for a little while on the skin. I don't think it can be good for my skin if it burns, and honestly wouldn't recommend it to anyone because of that, and the fact that my skin is the same after using it. Thanks, anyway for the sample, L'oreal! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Little Too Heavy While I didn't completely hate this moisturizer, I did find it to be a bit too heavy. I felt like my skin couldn't breath freely. I definitely prefer a higher end (department store) moisturizer over this brand."

"Not right for me I like the texture of this moisturizer. It's nice and creamy and didn't feel heavy. On me, it burned slightly, and I noticed it caused some redness in a few places. Could just be that my skin is too sensitive for it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I felt like this was too rich for my skin. I'm starting to break out by my ears and jawline where I don't get breakouts.

"Made my skin feel greasy I will not be using this anymore. It made my skin feel very greasy. I used a tiny amount and it still felt greasy, I have oily skin to begin with.

L'Oreal Paris Revitalift triple power deep-acting facial moisturizer This moisturizer seems to be very concentrated. A little dab will do. I tend to have more oily skin and thought it was a bit to greasy for me. It definitely did moisturize. It had a pleasant scent .

A Little Too Greasy I tried the L'Oral Revitalift Triple Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer and was disappointed that it made my face feel greasy and heavy feeling with a residue.

"Overpowering scent While the fragrance is nice, it is very overpowering. Within minutes of applying, I had to wash my face... twice... and the scent still lingered in my nose. The positive, my skin did feel softer after washing it off. I will pass these products on to someone who may be less sensitive to the scent. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer I tried it on my whole face first and didn't like the feel. As I don't have wrinkles, I thought I'd try it on my chin down, for the overall sagging. That was more tolerable. As with the serum, I noticed some benet after 1-1/2 weeks. I can only believe that I will continue to notice benefits from continued use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay is nice Doesn't feel cheap and is a good price. Feels nice on the skin and has a good finish. Great product.
"One week of L'Oreal Triple Power Day-Night This product is not my favorite item in the line of products. The smell is faint, and the feeling of the moisturizer is very thick. You seem to need more of this then you would think, it doesn't spread out very well. It made my face feel pretty oily and sticky, then after a few days I notice a change in my skin. My face did feel as oily and I notice the texture of my skin to have a better feel to it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Heavy texture and smell This moisturizer does hydrate the skin well, but has a very heavy texture and leaves a slip to the skin. This product also has a heavy scent to it that is not appealing to me. I have sensitive combination skin and this product did not clog up my pores, even though it felt a bit greasy on my face. This product does do the job of hydrating the skin, but I would not recommend it, due to the heavy texture and scent. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice looking jar I love the way the jar looks but not a fan of the smell, it kind of reminds me of bug spray. The cream has a nice consistency and makes your skin feel smooth. I would only use this cream at nice though. If the company would take all the off smelling fragrance out I would love this product. I will not be purchasing this product in the future. I did not see any difference in the fine lines on my forehead. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Super hydrating! So excited to try a facial product! When I received it I opened it and was happy to find almost no scent. I wanted to learn more about the ingredients in this product so I was easily able to look up information on their website. I began using it right away and have been using it for 9 days. It's simple to use, just wash then smooth it on. My skin feels very hydrated and much softer. I see only a slight improvement in the wrinkles I have. This is going to be a great product for the winter when my skin always feels dry. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
RevitaLift is not for me! I tried the RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer and I did not care for it. I have super sensitive skin and am not able to use a lot of products. The moisturizer felt very heavy and left my skin feelin oily. I tried all 3 products together as recommended and had hoped it would get better or more importantly feel better on my face but it never did. It did not make my face break out which was a plus. I won't be using the products anymore but am glad I got to try it free!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"smooth texture As with the serum, I found the lotion to be smooth texture but heavy very thick. I've been using it for about 3 weeks or more and I don't notice much of a difference. It does provide moisture but I'm not a fan of the smell. It goes on smooth but I feel that I have to rub it in more because of the thickness of the lotion. I don't feel that it is natural feeling. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not for Daytime After using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer along with the Serum in this line I have to say I really did not care for this moisturizer. It feels great going on the skin, but is way over fragranced and does not have any sunscreen in it. While packaging is marked for daytime and nighttime use I would not use during day because of lack of SPF. Loreal uses almost same fragrance in a lot of it's cosmetic items. This one just has too much of it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not a bad lotion I might be biased about lotions since I have a favorite already and now everything I use is compared to my favorite lotion. I use a benzoyl peroxide facewash so my face is very dry if I don't use a lotion afterwards. This lotion is decent and smells okay, but I just can't grow to like it because I already have my favorite lotion. I also saw it in the store, and the price is relatively high for such a small bottle and I would much rather buy my normal lotion for the same price but I get a huge bottle that lasts me a few months. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The cream... The feel of this cream is smooth and it absorbs nicely. It does not leave a tacky feeling on your skin. Much like the serum, I had a hard time getting past the smell. It's very strong. It made my skin feel nice but after a week of consistent use, it has not made any difference in the slightest on my skin. Maybe you have to use it longer to see any of the effects. I feel like it moisturized my skin, but did not live up to its own description. And again, the smell. I just can't deal with it. It's like a very strong perfume. If it didn't smell so strong I would give it more time to live up to its promises. But I just can't get past it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Too Heavily Fragranced I have been searching for a good moisturizer, so hoped this product would fit the bill. But after trying the product twice, I just couldn't stand to have it on my face due to its very strong floral fragrance. After nighttime use, I could still smell the product when I woke up the next morning! I applied the moisturizer following Concentrated Facial Serum at night, per the instructions. I was surprised my face did not feel greasy after using both products. The combination made for a very silky smooth and moisturized feel. However, I would never use this product again as the fragrance is just too overbearing. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This product has done wonders for my complexion!! I have been using Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream for 5 years, since I was 36 yrs. old, along with some of the other oil of olay products and i'm telling you ladies, it has done wonderful things for my face, my complexion and elasticity of my face. I have no wrincles at all, my face has elasticity and smoothnes. At 41 yrs. of age people thinks I'm 27-32 years old. They jaw drops when I reveal my age to them and they see my 18 and 16 year old daughters with me calling me mom. Thank you Oil of Olay...not even Sephora can make me look this young. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The scent is just too strong Tonight I tried the Serum and the Deep Acting Moisturizer. I have to say, the scent for both of these was a bit overwhelming. Even as I type this, I can still smell it very strongly and I'm not sure if I can last too much longer without washing it off (hence the lower star rating). The quality of the product itself seems to be pretty good, and I am optimistic. I am a daily makeup wearer (foundation and occasional blush), and sometimes have tendency towards oily skin (cycle driven, I believe), so I am a little cautious with the amount of moisturizers I am using. But since I have some age spots starting to show, and drooping around my eyes, I am willing to give this a try! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Dry Surprise The treatment has been very routine or me. I have combination skin and moisturizing is a must for me on a daily basis. I was very surprised to find that one day of missing the daily routine brought about some really dry, and flaky areas where I am normally oily, never dry. I was very disappointed to see this because I hadn't noticed any issues. I am not absolutely sure the reason why this would happen but it is unsettling to see dry patches where I am normally oily. I have only seen this happen to my skin when I have been swimming in water for a long period of time. I believe my skin is no longer producing it's own moisture due to too much hydration. It is possible. So I am going to discontinue the moisturizer at this time but I will continue the other two products. Let's see what happens now! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good Moisturizer, But Too Much Fragrance! I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer in evenings after applying the RevitaLift Serum for the past two weeks. I initially tried using the moisturizer in the mornings, but I found it to bee too heavy for my skin, and also seemed to flake away. I'm not sure how else to explain it, except that when applying my makeup there were little clumps that seemed to flake off. The moisturizer itself is a nice product, other than the horrible perfume smell. Compared to the other RevitaLift products, this one has the strongest perfume smell that does not seem necessary for a skin care product. Despite the perfume, the moisturizer did not cause any irritation or redness to my sensitive skin. The red glass jar gave the product an expensive feel and was easy to use to apply the product. After two weeks, I do feel like my skin is well moisturized and I may be imagining it, but the faint lines in my forehead seem less noticeable. I am not sure if it is due to the moisturizer, or the moisturizer used in combination with other RevitaLift products by L'Oreal. Overall, I will use what I have left of the moisturizer, but would not purchase another jar. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Ok...not my favorite. Honestly I want to love this!! I love the way it smells but despite the fact that it's nice and thick, I don't feel totally moisturized and I wonder if that's due to the perfume. I also feel like I can continue to tell I have product on my face-as if it hasn't absorbed. I only use this one at night and, living in dry dry Colorado, I usually slather on thick Cetaphil cream but using this one instead doesn't feel like an improvement. My dry spots tend to be more dry and I'm breaking out more than usual...now as a woman it's hard to tell if that's hormonal, the changing seasons, or a different product. I'm hesitant to blame it on anything too fast but I do feel like it's possibly the moisturizer. I'll keep trying it but think I may ultimately go back to my old faithful. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Why does a cream need that much fragrance! This product came well packaged and has attractive packaging. It's kept in a glass container that could cause issues for those using outside the home or with tile in their bathrooms due to risk of breakage if you're clumsy in the mornings. The moisturizer is creamy and absorbs well after application. I applied it at night so I didn't notice if it was easy to put on makeup afterwards. The fragrance is quite strong and as someone who is sensitive to scents, this is too much for me. My husband noticed it when I crawled into bed. I also noticed for the first few days, that I had a tingling/burning sensation after applying and my skin looked more red. I have sensitive skin to some lotions and this is one of them. It has lessened after a few days but the redness is still here. I haven't noticed much of a difference after a week but that might also be do to being an exhausted Mom to a 10 month old. Due to the fragrance, I will not be buying this product again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Disappointed Bought this last month. Trial size. Very disappointed. Nothing has improved/changed. No wrinkle repair, no re-firming."
"Not for me I got this product for free as a result of participating in the RevitaliftChallenge, through Influenster. I noticed after putting on the recommended amount of product on my face, it didn't absorb quickly. It left an overly moist feeling to my face after 10 minutes. On several occasions, after applying the product overnight, I had whiteheads across my face and forehead. Not many, but some, nonetheless. If I had the product on when I was active outside, reapplication was necessary, primarily because it would be wiped off soon after being applied, due to sweating. After two weeks, I didn't notice too much of a change the lines in my forehead did reduce, but not by much. I do want to try this product again when it's not so warm. I look forward to more positive results then."
"Smells like hairspray. I purchased a trial size of this moisturizer and am glad that is all I purchased. It has moisturizing abilities but I can hardly stand the smell. It smells exactly like many hairsprays. It takes quite a while for the scent to fade away, too. I was hoping this moisturizer would have some reflective ingredients but it does not."
"Little Too Heavy While I didn't completely hate this moisturizer, I did find it to be a bit too heavy. I felt like my skin couldn't breath freely. I definitely prefer a higher end (department store) moisturizer over this brand."
"Great For Dry Skin I tried this product and I looked like a glazed donut! I'm sure this is a great product if you have dry skin but if you have combo or oily skin I would avoid.

I wanted to learn more about the ingredients in this product so I was easily able to look up information on their website. I began using it right away and have been using it for 9 days. It's simple to use, just wash then smooth it on. My skin feels very hydrated and much softer. I see only a slight improvement in the wrinkles I have. This is going to be a great product for the winter when my skin always feels dry. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice Looking Jar I love the way the jar looks but not a fan of the smell, it kind of reminds me of bug spray. The cream has a nice consistency and makes your skin feel smooth. I would only use this cream at nice though. If the company would take all the off smelling fragrance out I would love this product. I will not be purchasing this product in the future. I did not see any difference in the fine lines on my forehead. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not Right For Me I like the texture of this moisturizer. It's nice and creamy and didn't feel heavy. On me, it burned slightly, and I noticed it caused some redness in a few places. Could just be that my skin is too sensitive for it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Heavy Texture And Smell This moisturizer does hydrate the skin well, but has a very heavy texture and leaves a slip to the skin. This product also has a heavy scent to it that is not appealing to me. I have sensitive combination skin and this product did not clog up my pores, even though it felt a bit greasy on my face. This product does do the job of hydrating the skin, but I would not recommend it, due to the heavy texture and scent. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer This moisturizer seems to be very concentrated. A little dab will do. I tend to have more oily skin and thought it was a bit to greasy for me. It definitely did moisturize. It had a pleasant scent . I would like to try this again in the winter months when I'm a little more dry. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Why Does A Cream Need That Much Fragrance! This product came well packaged and has attractive packaging. It's kept in a glass container that could cause issues for those using outside the home or with tile in their bathrooms due to risk of breakage if you're clumsy in the mornings. The moisturizer is creamy and absorbs well after application. I applied it at night so I didn't notice if it was easy to put on makeup afterwards. The fragrance is quite strong and as someone who is sensitive to scents, this is too much for me. My husband noticed it when I crawled into bed. I also noticed for the first few days, that I had a tingling/burning sensation after applying and my skin looked more red. I have sensitive skin to some lotions and this is one of them. It has lessened after a few days but the redness is still here. I haven't noticed much of a difference after a week but that might also be do to being an exhausted Mom to a 10 month old. Due to the fragrance, I will not be buying this product again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Overpowering Scent While the fragrance is nice, it is very overpowering. Within minutes of applying, I had to wash my face... twice... and the scent still lingered in my nose. The positive, my skin did feel softer after washing it off. I will pass these products on to someone who may be less sensitive to the scent. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer I tried it on my whole face first and didn't like the feel. As I don't have wrinkles, I thought I'd try it on my chin down, for the overall sagging. That was more tolerable. As with the serum, I noticed some benet after 1-1/2 weeks. I can only believe that I will continue to notice benefits from continued use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not A Bad Lotion I might be biased about lotions since I have a favorite already and now everything I use is compared to my favorite lotion. I use a benzoyl peroxide facewash so my face is very dry if I don't use a lotion afterwards. This lotion is decent and smells okay, but I just can't grow to like it because I already have my favorite lotion. I also saw it in the store, and the price is relatively high for such a small bottle and I would much rather buy my normal lotion for the same price but I get a huge bottle that lasts me a few months.

Noticed a difference in just two weeks! This product has made my skin smoother and supple after only two weeks. It absorbs well and leaves no residue. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Best facial moisturizer I have ever used! I am 41 years old and over the years have spent a small fortune on the latest and greatest facial creams. I have suffered from skin redness/blotchiness and dry/combination skin for the past 10 years. I used this particular regenerist product as a recommendation from a .org website for special skin problems. Within 2 weeks my uneven skin tone has leveled, and I am asked all the time if I am wearing foundation- which I don't! I have paid 4x as much for products that didn't work. I hope they never stop making something that I finally found after a 20 year search!"
"Made My Skin Feel Greasy I will not be using this anymore. It made my skin feel very greasy. I used a tiny amount and it still felt greasy, I have oily skin to begin with. Also caused my face to break out. I do have sensitive skin though. It did have a pleasant scent though and not overwhelming. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Dry Surprise The treatment has been very routine or me. I have combination skin and moisturizing is a must for me on a daily basis. I was very surprised to find that one day of missing the daily routine brought about some really dry, and flaky areas where I am normally oily, never dry. I was very disappointed to see this because I hadn't noticed any issues. I am not absolutely sure the reason why this would happen but it is unsettling to see dry patches where I am normally oily. I have only seen this happen to my skin when I have been swimming in water for a long period of time. I believe my skin is no longer producing it's own moisture due to too much hydration. It is possible. So I am going to discontinue the moisturizer at this time but I will continue the other two products. Let's see what happens now! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Strong Perfume Scent I wanted to love this, but the scent was so strong it made my throat itch and then I got a giant whitehead on my cheek. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not For Daytime After using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer along with the Serum in this line I have to say I really did not care for this moisturizer. It feels great going on the skin, but is way over fragranced and does not have any sunscreen in it. While packaging is marked for daytime and nighttime use I would not use during day because of lack of SPF. Loreal uses almost same fragrance in a lot of it's cosmetic items. This one just has too much of it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer I felt like this was too rich for my skin. I'm starting to break out by my ears and jawline where I don't get breakouts. The jar is heavy and pretty, but I much prefer a pump, and it's too heavily fragranced for my taste. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Disappointed Bought this last month. Trial size. Very disappointed. Nothing has improved/changed. No wrinkle repair, no re-firming."
"Smooth Texture As with the serum, I found the lotion to be smooth texture but heavy very thick. I've been using it for about 3 weeks or more and I don't notice much of a difference. It does provide moisture but I'm not a fan of the smell. It goes on smooth but I feel that I have to rub it in more because of the thickness of the lotion. I don't feel that it is natural feeling.

Serum Treatment it was a little dry...and my skin swollen....... had to go the docter medication....nope...no serum for me This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Ok...not My Favorite. Honestly I want to love this!! I love the way it smells but despite the fact that it's nice and thick, I don't feel totally moisturized and I wonder if that's due to the perfume. I also feel like I can continue to tell I have product on my face-as if it hasn't absorbed. I only use this one at night and, living in dry dry Colorado, I usually slather on thick Cetaphil cream but using this one instead doesn't feel like an improvement. My dry spots tend to be more dry and I'm breaking out more than usual...now as a woman it's hard to tell if that's hormonal, the changing seasons, or a different product. I'm hesitant to blame it on anything too fast but I do feel like it's possibly the moisturizer. I'll keep trying it but think I may ultimately go back to my old faithful.

Revitalift Is Not For Me! I tried the RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer and I did not care for it. I have super sensitive skin and am not able to use a lot of products. The moisturizer felt very heavy and left my skin feelin oily. I tried all 3 products together as recommended and had hoped it would get better or more importantly feel better on my face but it never did. It did not make my face break out which was a plus. I won't be using the products anymore but am glad I got to try it free!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
this product does work miracles The Regenerist hydration cream really does work. It made my face feel and look years younger. my skin was very smooth and I can even say I was glowing not literally but it made me feel a lot better about my appearance. That alone is worth the money. The product is very pricey but if you can scrap together the money it will help your over all appearance and make you feel good and smooth skin. To every one the best of luck to all that try this product out. It worked for me and it will work for you. hope this helps any one that wants to try this product out.

"The Scent Is Just Too Strong Tonight I tried the Serum and the Deep Acting Moisturizer. I have to say, the scent for both of these was a bit overwhelming. Even as I type this, I can still smell it very strongly and I'm not sure if I can last too much longer without washing it off (hence the lower star rating). The quality of the product itself seems to be pretty good, and I am optimistic. I am a daily makeup wearer (foundation and occasional blush), and sometimes have tendency towards oily skin (cycle driven, I believe), so I am a little cautious with the amount of moisturizers I am using. But since I have some age spots starting to show, and drooping around my eyes, I am willing to give this a try! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Lasting Moisture This is a slightly heavy moisturizer, perfect for overnight use. It has a nice clean smell that is not too perfume-y. It feels like it begins to soak into the skin quite quickly and does not feel greasy on the face. I have two small issues which will keep me from using the product in the future. First when I wash my face in the morning I can still feel the moisturizer on my skin as I wash, meaning it dies not soak in deeply or completely. Second, I dislike the jar, I have longer nails and I can't get the product out without ending up with it under my nails. A bottle or tube would be much easier to deal with.

Great For Parched Skin This moisturizer is great for a nighttime moisture blast. My skin definitely felt more supple in the morning. My only complaint is that the scent was a little strong. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Nice, But Had Issues Got the free trials in the mail, and did it every day. While my skin did feel softer, firmer, and with less wrinkles, I had two issues with it. First, it was heavily scented, and I am allergic to most scents. Second, on certain days, it would flake on my skin, and I had to wash most of it off."
"Good Moisturizer So far, I would say that, as a moisturizer, Revitalift is great. Doesn't seem to do much for wrinkles. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good Product For Very Dry Skin My skin definitely feels hydrated with this moisturizer. It's fairly thick, which is fine for night time, but it's a little too thick for daytime use, so I've been using the smallest dab for daytime. My skin is somewhat dry, but not overly so, and this product may be best for skin that is super dry. I like that it doesn't feel at all greasy, and it absorbs into the skin quickly. The smell isn't too strong, but I'd prefer that there be no perfumes at all in my moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"In My 6th Day Of The 14 Day Challenge It seems as though my skin is more hydrated, but will continue on through the 14 days. Although I love the concept of what this product does, I personally do not like the texture... very thick, and the smell is a bit nauseating. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Revitalift I took the RevitaLift 14 day challenge and sad to say I did not notice any of the improvements that others had claimed they did. I did like the texture and the way it felt when I applied it. It was not oily nor did it leave a greasy feeling on my face. Would I purchase it the answer is no.. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Hard To Work With some days I just don't want to put the effort into putting on a lot of makeup. on those days I'll usually just wear concealer on my skin. Unfortunately with this product I have to use primer out my concealer or any other makeup product I put on kind of rolls off like tacky flakies in a way that suggests I put way too much moisturizer on even though I know I didn't. it will do this with just a touch from my finger or blender. I used it for all of the 14 days and basically either went full glam or wore nearly no makeup at all. I definitely won't be buying this however I will continue to use my Hydra genius moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Good For Night Cream I've only used this product for 8 days every night. I found it a little too heavy to use in the morning even though it says day and night on the instructions. A little goes a long way and it covers well but for someone with combo skin I think it's best at night because it make my skin a little too sticky when I used it as a day cream. More updates coming as Revlon RevitaLift says full benefits are reached in 4 weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Locks moisture in Locks moisture in, which is great in the bitter, dry, cold of Chicago!"
"Wrinkles getting finer Hanen't used it very long, but it seems to be working! Thank you!"
"better than a lot While not the best lotion I have tried, it is much better than most I have tried for an antiaging lotion, especially for the price range."
RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer I tried a 5 day sample of this product to help keep my skin looking younger. Ii lotion is non greasy and absorbs but the scent is overpowering for me. I could not do the full 5 day sample becaue of the scent.
"RevitaLift Triple Power I have only been using the product 2 times a day for 3 weeks, i don't see enoguh hydration. I do see a smoothness, i don't see any more density or firmness, but i do think its to soon to tell."
Not sure Been using over a month .have seen no difference. I won't repurchase
"Smooooooth Love this stuff! Goes on smooth, doesn't feel greasy. It comes in a small jar but a little goes a long way, you only one little dab for each eye. I have used it mainly around my eyes for last few years. Trying to combat the crows feet and I do feel it is working.....and I am being realistic about results, absolutely nothing is going to eradicate the normal aging process short of plastic surgery. Try it!! You will like it! Skin feels hydrated! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Will try again in the spring To my diasppointment i had to stop using this product after 3 days.I have mature skin and it seems the skin on my face lost all moisture.From October thu may my forehead,nose,and chin are extremely dry and senitive, so when i did use this although if felt great the first 2 days i started to noticed the dry parts were getting worse.By the third day my skin was so itchy and red i couldn't wash nor touch my face. I do plan on trying this again once the whether gets warmer."
"OK, but ... Received 5 one-use samples and I prefer using skincare for a minimum of 10 days (preferably 14) before reviewing. I don't really have wrinkles, so I can't attest to those results but for firming/redensifying, it works well. Moisturizer feels too dry which I find in many firming/redensifying products. Needed to use an oil (argan) underneath to keep my skin hydrated. Also, as with most L'Oreal/Lancome products, the fragrance is too perfumey for my tastes."
"Revitalift Heavy feeling, not a fan of fragrance, have not noticed any changes in skin appearance at all! Would not purchase again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Heavy-Yet-Penetrating Formula Note: I've only used this product for two weeks, so there's a chance that continued usage would produce different results. The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer does an excellent job of adding long-lasting moisture to my skin - but I learned that a little of this product goes a *long* way. I honestly couldn't imagine using this as anything other than a night cream, as the formula is too heavy for my skin (sensitive/dry in the cooler months, sensitive/slightly oily during warmer months). When I began using the product, I applied too much on the first two days of usage - and noticed a slight outbreak of small pimples on areas of my skin which are naturally oilier than the rest. The outbreaks cleared, however, once I adjusted the amount of product I applied. Because such a small amount is needed for full facial coverage, I can see this product lasting a very long time. While its formula is rich, it still absorbed rather quickly (although I had to do a fair bit of massaging into my skin) and only left a slightly dewy appearance on my skin. The serum is lightly scented with a fragrance which is unlikely to be offensive to most users (it reminded me of a non-powdery/floral shampoo), and its scent quickly evaporated. The scent was almost identical to other products within the RevitaLift line. Its light scent was helpful considering that I only used this product before going to bed, and dislike having heavy fragrances lingering on my skin at that point. After several days of usage, I noticed that my skin was softer than usual upon awakening, and that problem spots for dryness (such as the area around my lips) were still somewhat moisturized after 8-10 hours. Given that I've experienced no adverse effects from using the moisturizer, I'm looking forward to finishing my current jar - and then re-evaluating my skin to see if enough improvements have occurred to warrant a new purchase. I can definitely see my using this as a winter night cream - especially on my dcolletage. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"REVITALIFT I feel a difference, less fine lines. It doesn't absorb all the way, I can feel it when I touch it. I would probably buy it if it's not too expensive. I have only used it a few days. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great product Love it this product is great and I plan on buying it over and over again. I recommend it to all skin types.

"Nice on face but didn't help with wrinkles This also felt very soft on the face and has a nice smell. It didn't help with wrinkles or poofy under eyes after 9 days of using this with Serum. I only used it at night, so maybe I needed to use it more. I was following directions. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Step two of the routine is weird So after using this for over a week I find that the step two of the routine has a weird film that comes off on my make up sponge or fingers. No matter how long I let it soak in. It still keeps my face soft. I have really noticed much change in fine lines yet. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Okay option for nightly face lotion I already have a face moisturizer that I use at night, so I'm pretty partial. This one is a little thick heavy for me - I have oily skin and am not ready for something so deep acting. Could be good for dry skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Triple lift! Hmmm Been using this product for 2 weeks... feels great on my skin. No breakouts and my skin doesn't feel oily. Not sure I see any reduction in wrinkles or dark spots however. I'll continue to use it though for now. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Works to firm facial skin..but a bit greasy This moisturizer is a little too thick and greasy. I do think that it has worked to firm my skin and I do notice reduction in small wrinkles on my forehead and next to my eyes. I would recommend this product even though it is greasy. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Deep-Acting Facial Moistuizer I didn't care for this product. I applied it in the morning before applying make-up. By lunch time all of my makeup looked clumpy on my skin and I looked very blotchy. I then switched to using it before bed on my neck. It goes on very thick and felt like it was wiping off on my pillow case. I think this will be my weekend moisturizer when I am not wearing makeup. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Strong scent I think this product smelled way too strong. 8 was very self conscious of the smell when my husband went to kiss me. I did however notice a difference in my dark spots on my face- I was having to use less foundation to cover dark spots after just a few days. The wrinkles on my face were still unchanged unfortunately. I'd like to see a bigger difference in my wrinkles. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Super Potent Moisturizer This moisturizer is thick and thoroughly moisturized my face and neck with a small amount. It would be a very effective product for someone with dry skin. My skin is a bit too oily for this product. It left my skin feeling a bit too slick. I think it might be too much with the serum. As a stand alone moisturizer it might be fine.

The way it makes my face glow I have very dry skin and do to my age i have wrinkles. Regenerist deep hydration cream makes my face feel soft it also relaxes the deep wrinkles. I love this product I put it on at night and daytime under my makeup. I highly recommend this product.When you start using it and you see the results you will not purchase anything else. Your face will glow!!!!!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Fantastic pore reducer First off I gave it 3 stars because in 3 wks of use it had just slightly softened the lines on my forehead but it has done wonders on the size of the pores on my face and evened out my complexion , made the skin super smooth and mostirized . I'm going to keep using to see if it helps the lines on my forehead This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I wish for more with it I like the feel of this it's not super thick or at all greasy. However, I've only used it a couple times. Mostly because I prefer a tinted moisturizer to even out my skin tone. If this came in a tinted version I would certainly continue to buy it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Not for me! After recieving as a sample I thought I would like L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Action Mosturizer as I am a fan of L'Oreal products. It smells great and does not feel stick when applying but towards the end on my day my skin became very oily and because I have already combination skin I didnt like how it felt. I don't recommend it for oily skin as it might cause skin to feel more oily. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Moisturizer I've used the Triple Power Facial Moisturizer for nearly two weeks now, every evening and most mornings, applying it over the Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment. On mornings when I didn't use the moisturizer over the serum, it was because I was using the sunscreen instead. Even though the fragrance is a bit heavy, this moisturizer did not leave a burning feeling on my face and it didn't make my face red... those are always my immediate concerns. A little does go a long way so I can tell this bottle will last a long time. The serum and especially the moisturizer both take a while to soak in and dry a bit. In the morning it wasn't that much of a problem, but in the evening I did have to remember to apply earlier than my bedtime since it took so long to dry up. A few nights I went to bed soon after applying the serum and moisturizer, and every time my face touched the pillowcase, it kinda stuck. So it was a bit of a hassle to try to remember applying the products earlier to give them time to dry. When using the moisturizer during the day, it was nice to feel like it was still working as the afternoon came on. Even after several hours at work, my face never felt dry. Also my normal-to-slightly-oily face didn't feel sticky, gummed up, or filmy like it can with some other heavy moisturizers. I gave the Revitalift Triple Power Facial Moisturizer 3 out of 5 stars because its heaviness did cause pimples to break out on both cheeks and forehead. The pimples formed right where my face is against the pillowcase all night. I skipped applying the moisturizer for a couple of nights but will resume after these blemishes clear.

"Works but greasy I loved the lotion the first time I used it. My combination skin was no longer dry on my cheeks and my face felt moisturized all day. And the lotion smells great. However, after about a week of using it, I noticed my nose and chin were very oily. I had to apply powder far more often to keep the shine down. I think this would be a great lotion for someone with overall dry skin. It's s very rich lotion and doesn't require you to use much to get results. Which makes it a great value.

"Make up free part 2 This is my final review I used the Revitalift serum and daily moisturizer for 2.5 weeks. I was on hopes that it would lessen the wrinkles under my eye when I smile. Unfortunately it did not, it does however give my skin a new soft feel. The effects that I reported in my first review still remain the warming sensation when applied. So for a girl who has never used anything but water on her face it was a pleasant experience after the first few days! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice face lotion, strong smell Again, a nice L'Oreal face product. Non-greasy, absorbs well into the skin. I just wish they would do away with the strong smell. Make it more fresh or no-odor. I've been an Olay user for many years and I found this to be fairly comparable. I have fairly sensitive skin and I had no adverse reaction to using it. No additional breakouts or redness. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
It's just ok I typically use high end skin care products and have for years. I was anxious to see how the L'Oral products would compare. I used the serum and deep acting moisturizer for a week. The products did not perform as well as my current routine. My face felt less moisturized and the texture of m skin was not as smooth. I also did not care for the fragrance in these products. It was a bit overpowering and lingered for quite a while. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Good product After using this product for a few weeks, I definitely notice a difference in how soft my skin is. Drawbacks of this product are: first, it has a strong perfume smell, and second, it is quite thick and the excess doesn't absorb into your skin. First time I tried it, I applied it liberally and in the morning I could literally scrape it off with my fingernail. The next time, I applied only a small amount and got better results. This also means the product will last you a long time. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I love the regenerist moisturizer I started with the total effects and it worked wonders but as I got older I decided to try more intensive treatment. The Regenerist moisturizer is great. i have had people come up at work and say What kind of makeup if you do wear makeup do you use I have been told without makeup that my skin is translucent. The scent is so fresh and the cream seems to even my skin out without foundation, If you can at all, buy this and see how long it lasts and how much good it does. I don't think you will be disappointed."
"First Week of Use Just wrapping up my first week of using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. It feels a little heavy compared to some others I have used in the past but goes on real smooth and doesn't stay heavy. The scent is a bit much as well but doesn't last long either. The moisturizer works well, as the colder windier weather is starting to hit and I haven't had any issues with dryness. I'm only on my first week, so nothing really to report as far as reducing fine lines and wrinkles. Yet. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Intensive action I used this after applying the triple power concentrated serum treatment. I only use this moisturizer at night. I found that no matter how lightly I apply the product, it seems to flake on my skin. Nonetheless, the cream feels very moisturizing and luxurious. It does have a perfumed scent that takes some getting used to. I do like that my skin feels soft and hydrated using this moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Feels good I tried the L'Oreal Paris RivitaLift Triple Power Deep acting Facial Moisturizer. I used it every night and some mornings for just over 2 weeks so far. I like the light scent. It leaves a non-greasy feel. It absorbs great. I have not noticed a change in my skin as of today. I hope to see smoother and younger looking skin as I continue to use the products.

"Extremely moisturizing L'Oreals revatalift Deep Acting Moisturizer looks great and smells fantastic. A small amount is enough to apply generously. For me, my facial skin is not dry enough for this product. I believe if you do have dry zones in your face, this would absolutely help with that. Upon applying it before bed, I could still feel it in the morning. The moisturizer has great staying power. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Heavy cream - only good for night time The pros of this facial moisturizer: it really does make my skin look healthy the next morning, and it doesn't cause any adverse reactions to my very sensitive skin. The cons: it is very heavy, which makes me worry that I'm clogging my pores (I may fall in love with it over the winter when my skin gets so dry it starts to chap), and the scent is not very pleasant and it sticks with you.

Liked but not loved I had been looking to a good moisturizer that I could add to my routine before bed. I tried the L'Oral revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer. When I first applied it to my freshly cleansed skin it felt heavy. Not what I expected to feel. After about a week using it my skin felt hydrated and smooth but it still felt pretty heavy. I didn't mind too much since I was only using it before bed. I did not care for the scent. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Smooth Silky, then greasy I've been using this product for over a week now and have seen some good things and some bad things with this product. Here's the good 1.) It made my skin feel smooth silky. 2.) It did re-hydrate my skin tighten it. Now here's the bad 1.) After a few days I noticed that my face started to feel greasy. 2) Due that greasiness even after washing my face twice a day I started to break out. I'm not sure this is a product that I would buy on a normal basis to my skincare routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Yes! Give me more....no really, i need more This product was great and really made my skin look and feel moisturized. It even smells great, however, for those of us with combo skin, it doesnt last long enough. My dry areas needed more lotion halfway through the day. Going back to the good points, my kids (2 and 10) saw me in the bathroom mirror applying this cream and wanted to try it too. I allowed them to put a little on and it was gentle enough on their sensitive skin. i made sure to watch over the next few days, but I saw no irritation on their faces. I also love that this product is really light. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Subtle fragrance, lightweight A little bit goes a long way with Revitalift Triple Power Moisturizer. The moisturizer is fairly thin in consistency, spreads easily and is absorbed fairly quickly into the skin. Although the fragrance is subtle it is still a bit too much for my preference since I am used to non-fragrant products - it did linger for the night and I could faintly smell it in the morning when I woke up. I am fairly picky about wearing heavy moisturizers to bed as I don't like to feel like I have heavy night cream on. The moisturizer was very light and did not bother me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Thick and moisturizing I used this as a night cream because it was very thick and moisturizing - in a good away. It doesn't say it's just for night, but it's so thick and moisturizing it works well to leave on all night. I'm not sure how make-up would apply over it since it was a little on the heavy side and I didn't use it during the day. I had a some issues with breakouts when I used it so perhaps it was too thick of a formula for me personally, but if you have dry skin that isn't sensitive you will love it.

You will be amazed at the actual benefits of Olay. Try the Olay products - there are levels according to your age and your skin care needs.
"Lasting Moisture This is a slightly heavy moisturizer, perfect for overnight use. It has a nice clean smell that is not too perfume-y. It feels like it begins to soak into the skin quite quickly and does not feel greasy on the face. I have two small issues which will keep me from using the product in the future. First when I wash my face in the morning I can still feel the moisturizer on my skin as I wash, meaning it dies not soak in deeply or completely. Second, I dislike the jar, I have longer nails and I can't get the product out without ending up with it under my nails. A bottle or tube would be much easier to deal with.

"Moisturizer Review So, last night I tried the facial moisturizer after my shower. The first thing I noticed was the smell. It wasn't an overpowering smell, but a weird almost medicine like smell. When I first put it on it was nice (aside from the smell). It went on smooth and had an almost radiant appearance. My skin felt smooth and not sticky or oily. After about 15 minutes I did notice a slight burning sensation. It wasn't a really uncomfortable feeling, just enough to notice it. My skin did feel a little oily this morning but that may have just been a reaction to a new product. I will keep using it to see the full effect. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Heavy Moisturizer The moisturizer is very rich which is why I gave it 3 stars, but it is so heavy that I could only use it at night. I even tried adding a matte balm over it before my make up, but it is not made to be worn under makeup. My make up did not set well, and I noticed that my face stayed shiny/glossy looking even after applying my setting powder. It does make for a great night time lotion though with it being so rich and heavy I don't feel like it rubs off at night. It has a great smell also. It isnt an overpowering fragrance for your face, but simply a light pleasant one. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The good + (not so) good! I'm torn on this review! On the one hand, it has some outstanding positives to recommend it. 1) Ah, the feeling of this cream! Thick, cushiony and luxurious without being at all greasy or sticky. A+ for texture. 2) It truly feels soothing and moisturizing on my dehydrated winter skin. I think it actually makes me look less dry and dehydrated and plumps out fine lines. And 3) it wears beautifully under sunscreen or makeup. So--bravo for all that! But the more practical, analytical side of me knows this has some serious downfalls, too. 1) Jar packaging. So convenient, especially for a thicker, lovely-feeling cream like this, but the minute products are exposed to air, any beneficial ingredients lose their efficacy, so there's that. 2) It's a heavy, bulky jar, so not travel-friendly exactly. 3) Fragrance. (It's not unpleasant smelling, but fragrance can be irritating, especially near eyes, so for me, that's a detractor and has no benefit to my skin care.) Lastly, it makes some big, unrealistic claims to repair wrinkles, re-firm and re-densify skin. No cream can do that! But given the jar packaging and fragrance, it's even less likely. (Left to Right in the photo: Revitalift Concentrated Facial Serum, Revitalift Triple Power Day Lotion Moisturizer, and on the far right, near my thumb--the thickest, most cushiony cream of the 3 products I tested, Revitalift Deep-Acting Moisturizer.)

"Thick stuff! I think that L'Oreal Paris's RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is super thick! I mean it totally moisturizes. I felt like it worked in to my skin easily. But I only felt comfortable putting this on at night because it is a thicker cream. After one application of rubbing it in all over my face and neck as prescribed, I woke up the next morning with quite a few zits along my jaw line... where I don't normally get break outs. Now I could have just not worked it in well enough... But I am leary since I don't want to have to worry about acne. So I will have to keep testing.

Loreal Revitalift triple power facial moisturizer I have been using this product since October 26th along with the Loreal concentrated triple power facial serum. I like the moisturizer better than the serum because it feels silkier and cooler on my skin and it leaves a slight tingle. In the time that I have been using the products I have not noticed any deeper lines and wrinkles diminishing but I have notices very slightly that some of the fine lines and wrinkles were reduced. I want to make sure that I give everything a fair chance so I will continue to use the products. It has not even been a month yet so perhaps there was not enough time yet to really notice a difference. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"A bit too heavy. As an active user of a different line up of makeup all together (One that can't be purchased over the counter) I wasn't particularly impressed. Not to the point of being willing to switch to less expensive over the counter product. After several days of use, I found the moisturizer to leave to a heavy residue on my face in the morning. It also had a strong perfume smell. Something I can do without. Overall, If it's in your budget, I would recommend going for something a little lighter in consistency and most likely, a little more expensive. This product may provide another just what they're looking for, but it wasn't for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer L'Oreal's Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer was a very rich and creamy night moisturizer. Perhaps too much so in fact because I found that it did not absorb well. In addition, it is recommended to pair this moisturizer with the night serum, but when I did this, it was extremely tacky and did not even absorb after several hours of application. If this experience was followed by outstanding results for wrinkle and fine line minimization, I would be open to tolerating it, but I did not realize any significant minimization of lines or wrinkles after several weeks of daily use. The positive about this moisturizer was that even with it being such a heavy rich moisturizer, I experienced no breakouts in my combination skin and my skin did feel softer.

"Worth the try There are many anti-aging products on the market and it is important to know what works and what doesn't before purchasing because none of these products are inexpensive. This moisturizer claims to repair wrinkles, re-firm and redensify. One of the things that I really like about this product is that it gives specific instructions on how to use it. Prior to using the L'Oral facial moisturizer, the instructions recommend cleansing thoroughly and first using the Triple Power Concentrated Serum. When done together in this manner, you can immediately feel your skin melting and softening to the touch. I used this product under and around my eyes, on my neck and jawline and on the tops of my hands. In one week's time, I noticed that I had much smoother skin in all these areas. At the end of two weeks, I found that my skin was becoming firmer and taking on a much more youthful appearance. I did notice a lightening of age spots but not much in the way of wrinkle reduction. I am a very critical reviewer and for a product like this would recommend using it every day for an extended period of time, such as a month, before making a final decision. So far, I really like what I am seeing and believe that it works much better than Olay products. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal Paris deep acting facial moisturizer I just received the LOreal Paris deep acting facial moisturizer and was pleased to see a full jar. The deep red packaging and fine print might not entice a busy consumer to read what the product does. The jar itself looks like a high quality product with its shiny silvery squared top. However, I personally found it easy to open but closing it evenly was a little more difficult to get the top on straight. The product is very creamy and has a slight odor which lingered on the skin for about 15 minutes before I put my make-up on.The ointment goes on easily and does not require a large amount to be applied. I look forward to seeing how my skin appears after a few days use. I wish they would have sent the eye cream as well for testing. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The Fountain of Youth I have always used Olay products, since I was in my 20's. I began to use the Olay Regenerist Microsculpting cream and Deep Hydration Cream in the past few years and the scowl line between my eyebrows was nearly gone. The lines around my eyes are visibly finer and my skin feels like velvet. People have commented how young I look. I am 60 years old and really, have only a minimal amount of wrinkles and I attribute that to the Olay products that I have used. My skin loves it. I won't use anything else. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Facial moisturizer I really loved how my skin stayed moist but I don't like the smell of it on my face. I wish it smelled better!
"Unsure if I would repurchase. Loreal Paris Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer feels so luxurious on the skin! It is lightweight and non greasy. The moisturizer is effective, my skin looked dewy, hydrated, and after the first few days of use the dry patches around my nose and eyebrows were gone. This cream also smells amazing but fragrance is something I usually avoid in terms of skin care. This also contains parabens and other ingredients that may be undesired to some. Check the label before purchasing! I love that the jar is glass, (the jar is gorgeous by the way!) it seems glass would be best for preserving the product. Overall I do love this moisturizer, but some of the ingredients may not be suited for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Thick Rich Moisturizer I've been using this L'Oreal Revitalift Facial Moisturizer off and on for a couple weeks. Cons: It's pretty thick and leaves my skin a little shiny. Since I don't wear makeup, I've decided to only use this product before bed. Also I have sensitive skin, and the perfume in this product irritates me just a bit. Pros: It's made my skin softer and younger looking in just a short period of time in conjunction with the Revitalift Serum. I'm in my early thirties and it's helped with the lines that are beginning to show around my mouth and eyes. Overall, I recommend adding this product to your daily routine if you like thick moisturizers and don't mind a strong perfume. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I'm just ok with this moisturizer. I'm always on a search for a moisturizer that doesn't leave my skin feeling oily since I have oily complexion. I found this product to leave my skin feeling some what oily. The jar is nice and the scent of it was light. It cream is heavy so a little goes a long way. Just a dab of it was enough for my entire face and neck. When I didn't wear makeup and left my face bare, my face felt fine. But when I wore makeup, it felt heavy. My makeup wouldn't hold up well and shortly after, my face had oil. This hasn't happened to me in a while so I was disappointed. I do see a difference in my face since starting this product along with the serum and day cream so it wasn't all too bad. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
RevitaLift Review Good coverage sorry did not see a big diff in 5 days like claim says.
"Outstanding hype, average product This L'Oral RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer makes a lot of promises that, frankly, it doesn't keep. But then, if you're old enough to have wrinkles, you're probably sort of used to that from beauty products! When I used this product, I did feel like there was some improvement to my complexion, and I felt like I was taking better care of my skin then when I wasn't using anything. But I definitely didn't see the sort of dramatic decrease in wrinkles that the product claims. My neck MAYBE seemed a bit firmer and that's a good thing. I plan to keep using it - hope springs eternal and could have been better at following the daily regimen. There doesn't seem to be any real downside to continuing - no skin irritations, no smothering perfumey smell - or medicine smell - to annoy. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Lose the scent, please Only used about a week, at night. No difference yet. Cannot use under foundation because the more you rub, it rolls right off. Scent is VERY heavy. Why in the world would you want such a heavily scented face moisturizer. It lost one star for scent, one for not being able to use under makeup."
Revitalift Triple Power....Doesn't work for me Although I do like the consistancy of the cream and the way it goes on....it has done nothing in reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on MY face. I don't know that there is ANYTHING out there that can help me... as far as a Product is concerned. I DO like the moisturizing quality of the cream and will most likely continue using it as the skin on my face has become extremely dry with age and menopause!!
"First Impressions Its been a week of religiously using this cream morning and night. My first thought upon opening the bottle was that it was heavily perfumed. I was hesistant because I have sensitive skin. It's been a week and I have had no irritation, no burning, and no red spots. So sensitive skin ladies can go for it! I also have combination skin and easily break out. Again, no problems. I am pretty confident this product works with all skin types. As far as moisturizing my skin I give it a 10 out of 10. It's not greasy, does not leave residue or feel like I have oil on my face. I have noticed my skin is much, much softer and I have no dry patches that usually pop up around fall and winter. The sunscreen in the cream is an added bonus! Now as far as fine lines go, it has only been a week. I can not tell a difference except for when I wear makeup. Usually my fine lines will be even more noticeable with makeup. Now they are not. In fact my makeup goes on much smoother and looks insanely better. For that reason alone I will continue with L'Oral. Oil of Olay, bye-bye!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Triple Power or Over Powering I used L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer daily for 2 weeks in conjunction with L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 and my skin seemed very smooth at first, but after the first week I had some acne appearing. I used each product by itself and think the culprit was the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. I have normal to dry skin and don't break out often, so I was a little bummed out that this product seemed to have that kind of reaction to my skin, almost making it too moist. I rated it at 3 stars because, while it didn't seem to work long term for me, the immediate results after a day of use were noticeable and positive. I liked the smell and consistency of the moisturizer and the packaging is very appealing in a ark shade of red. I don't have any wrinkles, so I can't speak for the wrinkle fighting power.

New face routine Day 1 of trying this new product and so far so good. My face feels soft. The product has a nice but not overpowering scent. I would give it more stars but it is only day one. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"This could be worth a try... I used this L'Oreal Deep Moisturizer for approx. two weeks. This has a nice consistency and the smell is not heavy. I generally have oily skin and this did not leave my skin any more/less oily than any other product I have used. This does come in a jar, which I am not crazy about, although you can definitely scrape every last drop out. I did not see any difference in texture/wrinkles. I did get a small patch of what looked like sweat pimples near my nose and two cyst like pimples. One under my chin and one on my neck. These were only on the L'Oreal side. I do not have sensitive skin. I did use the Serum/Day Lotions from this line, so I am not sure if the use of one or all were to blame, just to be fair. Due to the breaking out and the jar packaging, I would not purchase. This does seem to be worth trying if you do not have issues with those two things. For me, they were deal breakers. Also, I wish I had more than two weeks to try, as that is not enough time for a proper face product review. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Scent is too overpowering I have very oily skin and also very sensitive skin. This moisturizer is thick but it does not break me out and doesn't feel thick on my face. It absorbs very nicely into my skin and my pores have diminished. Unfortunately, the very strong fragrance is a no-go for me regardless of the effectiveness. If L'Oreal could remove the fragrance, I'd definitely be a fan. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Very heavy moisturizer I have been using this product that I received for free from Influenster to test out. This moisturizer is quite thick and heavy and while it does do a good job in moisturizing your face, I think it's too heavy to wear under makeup. I also haven't really noticed a huge difference in fine lines or wrinkles but I've only been applying at night. While I did receive this product for free, my opinions are all mine."
Great for oily skin I wanted tolove this product but it wasn't for my skin type. I generally gravitate towards clear serums but decided to give this product a try. Unfortunately I broke out. I find that this was too heavy could stand on its on as 2 in 1 type of product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Solid nighttime moisturizer I have been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for close to 2 weeks now. I use it every night after washing my face and applying the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment. This moisturizer is rich and creamy. My one critic is that after applying, my face itself feels like it's wearing foundation or heavy make-up. However, to the touch, my skin feels silky and not at all greasy. A little certainly goes a long way with this product. Since starting this cream, my skin has been so much more hydrated and the texture is definitely better. I feel like this will be a great addition to my skincare routine as we enter these colder and drier months. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Sensitive Skin Strikes Again... I loved the consistency of the product as it was very thick and velvety. A little definitely goes a long way! I have very sensitive skin and after the first use I had some slightly uncomfortable tingling. It was less noticeable with subsequent uses and there was never any redness. I was looking for a nice soothing lotion and found it slightly uncomfortable so It may not be the best product for gals with dry, sensitive skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good lotion but not my favorite I tend to agree with other reviewers and would be happier if this were in a pump container. Dipping into a jar isn't my favorite and can lead to bacteria. That said, the lotion itself is deeply moisturizing as advertised. The scent is a bit heavy for my liking, but overall, I enjoy the fragrance. Coupled with the serum it kept my skin soft and glowing all day long - always a plus! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Good for Night Cream I've only used this product for 8 days every night. I found it a little too heavy to use in the morning even though it says day and night on the instructions. A little goes a long way and it covers well but for someone with combo skin I think it's best at night because it make my skin a little too sticky when I used it as a day cream. More updates coming as Revlon RevitaLift says full benefits are reached in 4 weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"My makeup looks great! I slowly added products from the Oil of Olay Regenerist line to my daily regimen. My skin was dry from many years of sunbathing and the wrinkles were really showing. The Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream really softens and hydrates the skin. I did not get instant results but after consulting with Oil of Olay on-line chat, I was told to allow the product to work for about six weeks. I stayed with it and have found that this cream under my makeup creates a lovely finish. And for a fair price too!"
"Fine but won't replace existing products This is fine, but i don't like it more than my normal moisturizer, from Olay. I'm not nuts about the scent or how this sits on my face. I have combo skin - i don't think this makes me look greasy, im just partial to the scent and consistency of my normal moisturizer. This doesn't sit under my makeup as nicely, either. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not sure I received this product for free from influenster to try and review. I used it for 14 days and my feelings are a little mixed. Overall, I do feel like my skin is softer, but I also think that the cream made my face more oily than it already is. I'm also sensitive to fragrances and I feel like the scent of this cream is too strong to me. contest"
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer made my skin smooth and soft. I did notice however that it only temporarily plumped wrinkles but soon they reappeared. I don't have many wrinkles however so this wasn't too much of a bother. It comes in a jar which is probably why this occurred as beneficial ingredients diminish once the jar is open. It feels luxurious on the skin and has a wonderful smell but again fragrance ingredients are known to cause irritation and the preservative methylisothiazolinone. It visibly brightened and smoothed my skin however it felt pretty heavy on my skin and left it somewhat shiny. It is best used lightly. It is great for all to use except for those with allergies to to fragrance or if you are looking to control sagging of the skin or lifting of contours. It is a nice skin moisturizer but it wan't much different from other moisturizers I've used in the past except for the wonderful smell. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Not enough time to effectively try then bzz So far I think that I have a favorable opinion of the L'Oreal Revitalift products. But I honestly don't think I've had enough time to try then talk. Things I like about the product Containers are easy to use, not messy. Products have a lovely scent. All three products: L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer (1.7 oz) L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment (1.0 oz) L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 (1.7 oz) have a beautiful feel when applying. I really like that there is no residual and/or oily feeling. The only negative (not even sure it's a negative because I'm not sure if it's because I've only had a short period of time to try) I have is that after applying my skin seems to be peeling a bit. I'm not sure if this is because it is exfoliating the dead skin or an adverse reaction to the products. It has no other side affects, so I've continued to use. So far I haven't seen a reduction in wrinkles. I do feel that my skin feels and looks smoother. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Wrinkles Getting Finer Hanen't used it very long, but it seems to be working! Thank you!"
"Better Than A Lot While not the best lotion I have tried, it is much better than most I have tried for an antiaging lotion, especially for the price range."
Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer I tried a 5 day sample of this product to help keep my skin looking younger. Ii lotion is non greasy and absorbs but the scent is overpowering for me. I could not do the full 5 day sample becaue of the scent.

Step Two Of The Routine Is Weird So after using this for over a week I find that the step two of the routine has a weird film that comes off on my make up sponge or fingers.

"First Week Of Use Just wrapping up my first week of using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. It feels a little heavy compared to some others I have used in the past but goes on real smooth and doesn't stay heavy. The scent is a bit much as well but doesn't last long either. The moisturizer works well, as the colder windier weather is starting to hit and I haven't had any issues with dryness. I'm only on my first week, so nothing really to report as far as reducing fine lines and wrinkles. Yet. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Deep-acting Facial Moistuizer I didn't care for this product. I applied it in the morning before applying make-up. By lunch time all of my makeup looked clumpy on my skin and I looked very blotchy. I then switched to using it before bed on my neck. It goes on very thick and felt like it was wiping off on my pillow case. I think this will be my weekend moisturizer when I am not wearing makeup.

"Works But Greasy I loved the lotion the first time I used it. My combination skin was no longer dry on my cheeks and my face felt moisturized all day. And the lotion smells great. However, after about a week of using it, I noticed my nose and chin were very oily. I had to apply powder far more often to keep the shine down. I think this would be a great lotion for someone with overall dry skin. It's s very rich lotion and doesn't require you to use much to get results. Which makes it a great value.

"Scent Is Too Overpowering I have very oily skin and also very sensitive skin. This moisturizer is thick but it does not break me out and doesn't feel thick on my face. It absorbs very nicely into my skin and my pores have diminished. Unfortunately, the very strong fragrance is a no-go for me regardless of the effectiveness. If L'Oreal could remove the fragrance, I'd definitely be a fan. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Yes! Give Me More....no Really, I Need More This product was great and really made my skin look and feel moisturized. It even smells great, however, for those of us with combo skin, it doesnt last long enough. My dry areas needed more lotion halfway through the day. Going back to the good points, my kids (2 and 10) saw me in the bathroom mirror applying this cream and wanted to try it too. I allowed them to put a little on and it was gentle enough on their sensitive skin. i made sure to watch over the next few days, but I saw no irritation on their faces. I also love that this product is really light. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay It works really good an i use it every day it make ur skin nice a soft an clear its just my favorite an it smells really great
"Make Up Free Part 2 This is my final review I used the Revitalift serum and daily moisturizer for 2.5 weeks. I was on hopes that it would lessen the wrinkles under my eye when I smile. Unfortunately it did not, it does however give my skin a new soft feel. The effects that I reported in my first review still remain the warming sensation when applied. So for a girl who has never used anything but water on her face it was a pleasant experience after the first few days! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This Could Be Worth A Try... I used this L'Oreal Deep Moisturizer for approx. two weeks. This has a nice consistency and the smell is not heavy. I generally have oily skin and this did not leave my skin any more/less oily than any other product I have used. This does come in a jar, which I am not crazy about, although you can definitely scrape every last drop out. I did not see any difference in texture/wrinkles. I did get a small patch of what looked like sweat pimples near my nose and two cyst like pimples. One under my chin and one on my neck. These were only on the L'Oreal side. I do not have sensitive skin. I did use the Serum/Day Lotions from this line, so I am not sure if the use of one or all were to blame, just to be fair. Due to the breaking out and the jar packaging, I would not purchase. This does seem to be worth trying if you do not have issues with those two things. For me, they were deal breakers. Also, I wish I had more than two weeks to try, as that is not enough time for a proper face product review. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Works To Firm Facial Skin..but A Bit Greasy This moisturizer is a little too thick and greasy. I do think that it has worked to firm my skin and I do notice reduction in small wrinkles on my forehead and next to my eyes. I would recommend this product even though it is greasy. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Okay Option For Nightly Face Lotion I already have a face moisturizer that I use at night, so I'm pretty partial. This one is a little thick heavy for me - I have oily skin and am not ready for something so deep acting. Could be good for dry skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Thick & Rich Moisturizer I've been using this L'Oreal Revitalift Facial Moisturizer off and on for a couple weeks. Cons: It's pretty thick and leaves my skin a little shiny. Since I don't wear makeup, I've decided to only use this product before bed. Also I have sensitive skin, and the perfume in this product irritates me just a bit. Pros: It's made my skin softer and younger looking in just a short period of time in conjunction with the Revitalift Serum. I'm in my early thirties and it's helped with the lines that are beginning to show around my mouth and eyes. Overall, I recommend adding this product to your daily routine if you like thick moisturizers and don't mind a strong perfume. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Solid Nighttime Moisturizer I have been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for close to 2 weeks now. I use it every night after washing my face and applying the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment. This moisturizer is rich and creamy. My one critic is that after applying, my face itself feels like it's wearing foundation or heavy make-up. However, to the touch, my skin feels silky and not at all greasy. A little certainly goes a long way with this product. Since starting this cream, my skin has been so much more hydrated and the texture is definitely better. I feel like this will be a great addition to my skincare routine as we enter these colder and drier months. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Fantastic Pore Reducer First off I gave it 3 stars because in 3 wks of use it had just slightly softened the lines on my forehead but it has done wonders on the size of the pores on my face and evened out my complexion , made the skin super smooth and mostirized . I'm going to keep using to see if it helps the lines on my forehead This review was collected as part of a promotion."
I Tried All Three The products did not soak into my face well and left feeling sticky and gross for sleeping in particular. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Nice On Face But Didn't Help With Wrinkles This also felt very soft on the face and has a nice smell. It didn't help with wrinkles or poofy under eyes after 9 days of using this with Serum. I only used it at night, so maybe I needed to use it more. I was following directions. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Unsure If I Would Repurchase. Loreal Paris Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer feels so luxurious on the skin! It is lightweight and non greasy. The moisturizer is effective, my skin looked dewy, hydrated, and after the first few days of use the dry patches around my nose and eyebrows were gone. This cream also smells amazing but fragrance is something I usually avoid in terms of skin care. This also contains parabens and other ingredients that may be undesired to some. Check the label before purchasing! I love that the jar is glass, (the jar is gorgeous by the way!) it seems glass would be best for preserving the product. Overall I do love this moisturizer, but some of the ingredients may not be suited for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great This product is the best of the best for me and you. I love the way it is not the only way to get a new look
"L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer L'Oreal's Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer was a very rich and creamy night moisturizer. Perhaps too much so in fact because I found that it did not absorb well. In addition, it is recommended to pair this moisturizer with the night serum, but when I did this, it was extremely tacky and did not even absorb after several hours of application. If this experience was followed by outstanding results for wrinkle and fine line minimization, I would be open to tolerating it, but I did not realize any significant minimization of lines or wrinkles after several weeks of daily use. The positive about this moisturizer was that even with it being such a heavy rich moisturizer, I experienced no breakouts in my combination skin and my skin did feel softer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
It's Just Ok I typically use high end skin care products and have for years. I was anxious to see how the L'Oral products would compare. I used the serum and deep acting moisturizer for a week. The products did not perform as well as my current routine. My face felt less moisturized and the texture of m skin was not as smooth. I also did not care for the fragrance in these products. It was a bit overpowering and lingered for quite a while. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Heavy Moisturizer The moisturizer is very rich which is why I gave it 3 stars, but it is so heavy that I could only use it at night. I even tried adding a matte balm over it before my make up, but it is not made to be worn under makeup. My make up did not set well, and I noticed that my face stayed shiny/glossy looking even after applying my setting powder. It does make for a great night time lotion though with it being so rich and heavy I don't feel like it rubs off at night. It has a great smell also. It isnt an overpowering fragrance for your face, but simply a light pleasant one. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'oreal Revitalift Triple Power Facial Moisturizer I've used the Triple Power Facial Moisturizer for nearly two weeks now, every evening and most mornings, applying it over the Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment. On mornings when I didn't use the moisturizer over the serum, it was because I was using the sunscreen instead. Even though the fragrance is a bit heavy, this moisturizer did not leave a burning feeling on my face and it didn't make my face red... those are always my immediate concerns. A little does go a long way so I can tell this bottle will last a long time. The serum and especially the moisturizer both take a while to soak in and dry a bit. In the morning it wasn't that much of a problem, but in the evening I did have to remember to apply earlier than my bedtime since it took so long to dry up. A few nights I went to bed soon after applying the serum and moisturizer, and every time my face touched the pillowcase, it kinda stuck. So it was a bit of a hassle to try to remember applying the products earlier to give them time to dry. When using the moisturizer during the day, it was nice to feel like it was still working as the afternoon came on. Even after several hours at work, my face never felt dry. Also my normal-to-slightly-oily face didn't feel sticky, gummed up, or filmy like it can with some other heavy moisturizers. I gave the Revitalift Triple Power Facial Moisturizer 3 out of 5 stars because its heaviness did cause pimples to break out on both cheeks and forehead. The pimples formed right where my face is against the pillowcase all night. I skipped applying the moisturizer for a couple of nights but will resume after these blemishes clear.

"Sensitive Skin The product was great as a moisturizer, but I had to stop using it because my skin was to sensitive and my skin became itchy and blotchy. I would recommend it for dry skin, though. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Face Feels Soft And Hydrated I have been using the product for a week. I can see how soft and hydrated my face show. Suggest this product. Especially in winter. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Smooth & Silky, Then Greasy I've been using this product for over a week now and have seen some good things and some bad things with this product. Here's the good 1.) It made my skin feel smooth silky. 2.) It did re-hydrate my skin tighten it. Now here's the bad 1.) After a few days I noticed that my face started to feel greasy. 2) Due that greasiness even after washing my face twice a day I started to break out. I'm not sure this is a product that I would buy on a normal basis to my skincare routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The Good + (Not So) Good! I'm torn on this review! On the one hand, it has some outstanding positives to recommend it. 1) Ah, the feeling of this cream! Thick, cushiony and luxurious without being at all greasy or sticky. A+ for texture. 2) It truly feels soothing and moisturizing on my dehydrated winter skin. I think it actually makes me look less dry and dehydrated and plumps out fine lines. And 3) it wears beautifully under sunscreen or makeup. So--bravo for all that! But the more practical, analytical side of me knows this has some serious downfalls, too. 1) Jar packaging. So convenient, especially for a thicker, lovely-feeling cream like this, but the minute products are exposed to air, any beneficial ingredients lose their efficacy, so there's that. 2) It's a heavy, bulky jar, so not travel-friendly exactly. 3) Fragrance. (It's not unpleasant smelling, but fragrance can be irritating, especially near eyes, so for me, that's a detractor and has no benefit to my skin care.) Lastly, it makes some big, unrealistic claims to repair wrinkles, re-firm and re-densify skin. No cream can do that! But given the jar packaging and fragrance, it's even less likely. (Left to Right in the photo: Revitalift Concentrated Facial Serum, Revitalift Triple Power Day Lotion Moisturizer, and on the far right, near my thumb--the thickest, most cushiony cream of the 3 products I tested, Revitalift Deep-Acting Moisturizer.)

"Triple Power Or Over Powering? I used L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer daily for 2 weeks in conjunction with L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 and my skin seemed very smooth at first, but after the first week I had some acne appearing. I used each product by itself and think the culprit was the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. I have normal to dry skin and don't break out often, so I was a little bummed out that this product seemed to have that kind of reaction to my skin, almost making it too moist. I rated it at 3 stars because, while it didn't seem to work long term for me, the immediate results after a day of use were noticeable and positive. I liked the smell and consistency of the moisturizer and the packaging is very appealing in a ark shade of red. I don't have any wrinkles, so I can't speak for the wrinkle fighting power. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I Wish For More With It I like the feel of this it's not super thick or at all greasy. However, I've only used it a couple times. Mostly because I prefer a tinted moisturizer to even out my skin tone. If this came in a tinted version I would certainly continue to buy it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Wonderful product I have used this product for years and my skin is supple and has very few wrinkles. People constantly come up to me and comment on what lovely skin I have. I also have people commenting that I look 20 years younger than my actual age. I know my Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream has been a huge help in staying young looking. It is velvety and rich and my skin drinks it in. I love it! My foundation smooths on easily over my Hydrating Cream and my complexion has a dewy glow. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Feels Good I tried the L'Oreal Paris RivitaLift Triple Power Deep acting Facial Moisturizer. I used it every night and some mornings for just over 2 weeks so far. I like the light scent. It leaves a non-greasy feel. It absorbs great. I have not noticed a change in my skin as of today. I hope to see smoother and younger looking skin as I continue to use the products. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Thick And Moisturizing I used this as a night cream because it was very thick and moisturizing - in a good away. It doesn't say it's just for night, but it's so thick and moisturizing it works well to leave on all night. I'm not sure how make-up would apply over it since it was a little on the heavy side and I didn't use it during the day. I had a some issues with breakouts when I used it so perhaps it was too thick of a formula for me personally, but if you have dry skin that isn't sensitive you will love it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Outstanding Hype, Average Product This L'Oral RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer makes a lot of promises that, frankly, it doesn't keep. But then, if you're old enough to have wrinkles, you're probably sort of used to that from beauty products! When I used this product, I did feel like there was some improvement to my complexion, and I felt like I was taking better care of my skin then when I wasn't using anything. But I definitely didn't see the sort of dramatic decrease in wrinkles that the product claims. My neck MAYBE seemed a bit firmer and that's a good thing. I plan to keep using it - hope springs eternal and could have been better at following the daily regimen. There doesn't seem to be any real downside to continuing - no skin irritations, no smothering perfumey smell - or medicine smell - to annoy. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Triple Lift?! Hmmm Been using this product for 2 weeks... feels great on my skin. No breakouts and my skin doesn't feel oily. Not sure I see any reduction in wrinkles or dark spots however. I'll continue to use it though for now. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Liked But Not Loved I had been looking to a good moisturizer that I could add to my routine before bed. I tried the L'Oral revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer. When I first applied it to my freshly cleansed skin it felt heavy. Not what I expected to feel. After about a week using it my skin felt hydrated and smooth but it still felt pretty heavy. I didn't mind too much since I was only using it before bed. I did not care for the scent. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Good Product After using this product for a few weeks, I definitely notice a difference in how soft my skin is. Drawbacks of this product are: first, it has a strong perfume smell, and second, it is quite thick and the excess doesn't absorb into your skin. First time I tried it, I applied it liberally and in the morning I could literally scrape it off with my fingernail. The next time, I applied only a small amount and got better results. This also means the product will last you a long time. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good Lotion But Not My Favorite I tend to agree with other reviewers and would be happier if this were in a pump container. Dipping into a jar isn't my favorite and can lead to bacteria. That said, the lotion itself is deeply moisturizing as advertised. The scent is a bit heavy for my liking, but overall, I enjoy the fragrance. Coupled with the serum it kept my skin soft and glowing all day long - always a plus! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Fine But Won't Replace Existing Products This is fine, but i don't like it more than my normal moisturizer, from Olay. I'm not nuts about the scent or how this sits on my face. I have combo skin - i don't think this makes me look greasy, im just partial to the scent and consistency of my normal moisturizer. This doesn't sit under my makeup as nicely, either. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Loreal Revitalift Triple Power Facial Moisturizer I have been using this product since October 26th along with the Loreal concentrated triple power facial serum. I like the moisturizer better than the serum because it feels silkier and cooler on my skin and it leaves a slight tingle. In the time that I have been using the products I have not noticed any deeper lines and wrinkles diminishing but I have notices very slightly that some of the fine lines and wrinkles were reduced. I want to make sure that I give everything a fair chance so I will continue to use the products. It has not even been a month yet so perhaps there was not enough time yet to really notice a difference. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Extremely Moisturizing L'Oreals revatalift Deep Acting Moisturizer looks great and smells fantastic. A small amount is enough to apply generously. For me, my facial skin is not dry enough for this product. I believe if you do have dry zones in your face, this would absolutely help with that. Upon applying it before bed, I could still feel it in the morning. The moisturizer has great staying power. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
The Best Absolutely the best. Fresh scent not abrasive. Left my skin sing a song of six pents. Love it love it love
L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer made my skin smooth and soft. I did notice however that it only temporarily plumped wrinkles but soon they reappeared. I don't have many wrinkles however so this wasn't too much of a bother. It comes in a jar which is probably why this occurred as beneficial ingredients diminish once the jar is open. It feels luxurious on the skin and has a wonderful smell but again fragrance ingredients are known to cause irritation and the preservative methylisothiazolinone. It visibly brightened and smoothed my skin however it felt pretty heavy on my skin and left it somewhat shiny. It is best used lightly. It is great for all to use except for those with allergies to to fragrance or if you are looking to control sagging of the skin or lifting of contours. It is a nice skin moisturizer but it wan't much different from other moisturizers I've used in the past except for the wonderful smell. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Heavy-yet-penetrating Formula Note: I've only used this product for two weeks, so there's a chance that continued usage would produce different results. The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer does an excellent job of adding long-lasting moisture to my skin - but I learned that a little of this product goes a *long* way. I honestly couldn't imagine using this as anything other than a night cream, as the formula is too heavy for my skin (sensitive/dry in the cooler months, sensitive/slightly oily during warmer months). When I began using the product, I applied too much on the first two days of usage - and noticed a slight outbreak of small pimples on areas of my skin which are naturally oilier than the rest. The outbreaks cleared, however, once I adjusted the amount of product I applied. Because such a small amount is needed for full facial coverage, I can see this product lasting a very long time. While its formula is rich, it still absorbed rather quickly (although I had to do a fair bit of massaging into my skin) and only left a slightly dewy appearance on my skin. The serum is lightly scented with a fragrance which is unlikely to be offensive to most users (it reminded me of a non-powdery/floral shampoo), and its scent quickly evaporated. The scent was almost identical to other products within the RevitaLift line. Its light scent was helpful considering that I only used this product before going to bed, and dislike having heavy fragrances lingering on my skin at that point. After several days of usage, I noticed that my skin was softer than usual upon awakening, and that problem spots for dryness (such as the area around my lips) were still somewhat moisturized after 8-10 hours. Given that I've experienced no adverse effects from using the moisturizer, I'm looking forward to finishing my current jar - and then re-evaluating my skin to see if enough improvements have occurred to warrant a new purchase. I can definitely see my using this as a winter night cream - especially on my dcolletage. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Revitalift I feel a difference, less fine lines. It doesn't absorb all the way, I can feel it when I touch it. I would probably buy it if it's not too expensive. I have only used it a few days. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not Enough Time To Effectively Try Then Bzz So far I think that I have a favorable opinion of the L'Oreal Revitalift products. But I honestly don't think I've had enough time to try then talk. Things I like about the product Containers are easy to use, not messy. Products have a lovely scent. All three products: L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer (1.7 oz) L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment (1.0 oz) L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 (1.7 oz) have a beautiful feel when applying. I really like that there is no residual and/or oily feeling. The only negative (not even sure it's a negative because I'm not sure if it's because I've only had a short period of time to try) I have is that after applying my skin seems to be peeling a bit. I'm not sure if this is because it is exfoliating the dead skin or an adverse reaction to the products. It has no other side affects, so I've continued to use. So far I haven't seen a reduction in wrinkles. I do feel that my skin feels and looks smoother. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Intensive Action I used this after applying the triple power concentrated serum treatment. I only use this moisturizer at night. I found that no matter how lightly I apply the product, it seems to flake on my skin. Nonetheless, the cream feels very moisturizing and luxurious. It does have a perfumed scent that takes some getting used to. I do like that my skin feels soft and hydrated using this moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Heavy Cream - Only Good For Night Time The pros of this facial moisturizer: it really does make my skin look healthy the next morning, and it doesn't cause any adverse reactions to my very sensitive skin. The cons: it is very heavy, which makes me worry that I'm clogging my pores (I may fall in love with it over the winter when my skin gets so dry it starts to chap), and the scent is not very pleasant and it sticks with you. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice Face Lotion, Strong Smell Again, a nice L'Oreal face product. Non-greasy, absorbs well into the skin. I just wish they would do away with the strong smell. Make it more fresh or no-odor. I've been an Olay user for many years and I found this to be fairly comparable. I have fairly sensitive skin and I had no adverse reaction to using it. No additional breakouts or redness. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Thick Stuff! I think that L'Oreal Paris's RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is super thick! I mean it totally moisturizes. I felt like it worked in to my skin easily. But I only felt comfortable putting this on at night because it is a thicker cream. After one application of rubbing it in all over my face and neck as prescribed, I woke up the next morning with quite a few zits along my jaw line... where I don't normally get break outs. Now I could have just not worked it in well enough... But I am leary since I don't want to have to worry about acne. So I will have to keep testing. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'oreal Paris Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer I just received the LOreal Paris deep acting facial moisturizer and was pleased to see a full jar. The deep red packaging and fine print might not entice a busy consumer to read what the product does. The jar itself looks like a high quality product with its shiny silvery squared top. However, I personally found it easy to open but closing it evenly was a little more difficult to get the top on straight. The product is very creamy and has a slight odor which lingered on the skin for about 15 minutes before I put my make-up on.The ointment goes on easily and does not require a large amount to be applied. I look forward to seeing how my skin appears after a few days use. I wish they would have sent the eye cream as well for testing. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Locks Moisture In Locks moisture in, which is great in the bitter, dry, cold of Chicago!"
"Will Try Again In The Spring To my diasppointment i had to stop using this product after 3 days.I have mature skin and it seems the skin on my face lost all moisture.From October thu may my forehead,nose,and chin are extremely dry and senitive, so when i did use this although if felt great the first 2 days i started to noticed the dry parts were getting worse.By the third day my skin was so itchy and red i couldn't wash nor touch my face. I do plan on trying this again once the whether gets warmer."
"Ok, But ... Received 5 one-use samples and I prefer using skincare for a minimum of 10 days (preferably 14) before reviewing. I don't really have wrinkles, so I can't attest to those results but for firming/redensifying, it works well. Moisturizer feels too dry which I find in many firming/redensifying products. Needed to use an oil (argan) underneath to keep my skin hydrated. Also, as with most L'Oreal/Lancome products, the fragrance is too perfumey for my tastes."
Revitalift Triple Power....doesn't Work For Me Although I do like the consistancy of the cream and the way it goes on....it has done nothing in reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on MY face. I don't know that there is ANYTHING out there that can help me... as far as a Product is concerned. I DO like the moisturizing quality of the cream and will most likely continue using it as the skin on my face has become extremely dry with age and menopause!!
Facial Moisturizer I really loved how my skin stayed moist but I don't like the smell of it on my face. I wish it smelled better!
"Revitalift Triple Power I have only been using the product 2 times a day for 3 weeks, i don't see enoguh hydration. I do see a smoothness, i don't see any more density or firmness, but i do think its to soon to tell."
Revitalift Review Good coverage sorry did not see a big diff in 5 days like claim says.
"Wonderful uplifting cream I use this both in the morning and at night. It is super creamy and disappears right into your skin, leaving it very soft. I apply my makeup right over it to ego the new day. I have been using this product since it was first introduced and feel that it has helped my skin age kindly. I recommend that you try it soon.

"Night Time Luxury Though this cream isn't marketed for night-time use, I found that the evening is the best time for me to apply it. Because it is thick and rich, it is too heavy for day use on my combination skin. At night, though, it feels like a wonderful treat and leaves my skin looking and feeling soft and smooth in the morning. I'm so pleased with the entire L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift line! For a girl in her mid-thirties, I'm looking to keep my skin gorgeous for a long time and I know that work starts now. This protective, regenerative moisturizer is a great tool in that battle against wrinkles and spots!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Deeply Moisturizing Is Right! At 30 years old, I'm trying to care for my skin well but the combination of oily and dry makes it a bit of a challenge. L'Oreal Paris' RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is truly deep acting and moisturizing. It goes on smoothly without being too heavy, goopy, or sticky. After use, my winter-worn skin was tighter, smoother, and brighter- it just seemed happier and clearly better cared for. Because of my combination skin, I realized daily use was too much for me so I cut down to a couple times a week all over and daily use just on drier parts of my skin. I recommend this to everyone for occasional use, but definitely for those who have drier skin and need the deep moisturizing. I even use it on my hands! After a day of baking and frequent hand washing and outdoor work in cold weather, my hands were chapped, dry, and worn, I used the facial moisturizer on them before bed and, in addition to instantly feeling better, they were soft and rejuvenated in the morning.

Thick Lotion Smooth.. I think this lotion is great especially for the winter. it is a little thick so little bit goes a long way and you have to really rub it in. I think it's better it's for winter when skin us more dry. It does smell nice and makes my face soft and radiant. Goes nice after using the serum . This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Products That Work, Great!!! However.... I used this product for about 10 days. When you apply it, it feels great, its thick but not cakey, however I do have oily skin and I feel that it is a bit oily and shiny, when I rubbed the product a bit too much it would roll off my fingers. It also does have similar ingredients to other moisturizers I have used with sunscreen. But the feel is great. It works great, smells wonderful, and most importantly I see my skin is smoother and tighter, and it does moisturize well. So woohooo!! thumbs up. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"My Revitalift Challenge Gets 4 Stars! I was recently sent a free 2 week sample, Updates Shipping we right on time. As for the product it had a very nice smell, it didnt clog my pores amd made my face feel smooth. I noticed quickly the small change in my skin. I give it a 4 only because it wasn't as dramatic as the product was advertised. However it did do what it said it would with a larger supply i guarentee it would give you the results you would expect. Overall I'm satisfied may purchase this in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
A Great New Moisturizer... I also really enjoyed the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer (1.7 oz). I saw dramatic results immediately and my complexion was more radiant than ever. I again was surprised by how non-greasy the formula was. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Wow! I did the 14 day challenge and wow what a difference. My face has never felt smoother or softer since using this product. I was amazed that my oily skin didnt have any breakouts while using this. I will keep this as part of my daily facial routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Really Good For Dry Skin My skin is very very dry, i got samples of this product, used it for 14 days and it was great. It keep my skin hydarted whole day. You dont need to apply it again and again unless you wash off your face. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Smooth I have use revitalift for 14 days and loved the results that I got. It smoothed and lifted my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
14 Day Sample Was Great! I received this in the 14 day trial package and have really enjoyed it. It was difficult to find enough in the packet to cover my face and neck for 2 applications. I am thankful to have been chosen to try. I noticed a brightness in my tone. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Thumbs Up For This Product Believe it or not this ravitalift anti-aging cream has helped me to make my skin tone even and better. Its been more than 10 days I am using it and can feel the difference. I am using it every morning and night. This does not have sticky or oily effect which is the best quality. It smells smooth and nice. Some people may feel no Change or a slight change after using it but I still recommend to use it at least month and then comment. Every skin type is different and this will go with any. I have a combination skin like dry and patchy, it is working well for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Good Moisturizer I got a sample of this product and would buy it. I like it a lot. Very good moisturizer This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Very nice lightweight cream Was persuaded to try this product because of the peptide vitamin B ingredients. The non-jar packaging was also a selling point. This is a very nice, light-weight cream, that absorbs quickly. It sits so lightly on my skin that I can't feel it and has an ever so slight pleasant scent that dissipates quickly. It does a nice job of moisturizing without resulting in unwanted shine. It's working well for both night-time and day-time use for my aging, sun damaged, somewhat reactive skin. In fact it seems to have a calming effect on my reactive areas. I've been trying many different moisturizers lately - high-end and drug-store brands - and so far this is the best."
"Good Product. Have used it for 9 days now. I feel as though my skin is more moist. I like the smell, and it doesn't irritate my eyes. Not much difference in the wrinkles, but maybe after months of use it would look better. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Fantastic! I used my trial packets and was amazed! My skin looked younger and moist wirhin 5 days. I wpuld recommend this to anyone
"Great Moisturizer! So i got the 14 day sample pack aka RevitaliftChallenge and i do notice a difference in my face! This moisturizer goes a long way with just a little bit. My skin feels firmer, looks brighter and stays hydrated all day. It blends perfectly with my makeup as well and smells wonderful! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
I Liked It I liked the product. It didnt feel greasy on my skin. It helped soften my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"As Good As Always I received the 14 days sample. It is good, just as expected as the Revitalift products before. Mostly, I like one cream for both day and night use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Another Good One! I had my doubts when I tried this product, but after using it every morning and night for over three weeks now, I can honestly tell a difference in my skin! It's definitely smoother more moisturized. Maybe even a little brighter too! I thought it would break me out since aI have sensitive and oily skin, but it didn't at all! As far as absorbing into my skin, it took a little bit of time, but nothing too crazy. Sometimes I could still feel the product on my skin pulling away from the pillowcase if I was laying on my side. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Revitalift I like this moisturizer because my skin feels hydrated all day. It is a very light moisturizer and not at all oily. Although I have been using it for close to three weeks I can't say that I have noticed any changes with the wrinkles on my face. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Smells Good Slight Burning I received my 14 day sample and started today. It smelled good and felt nice. Although it did have a burning feeling this morning and again tonight. Not bad. I'll try it again tomorrow so long as nothing drastic happens. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Revitalift Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer This is a very thick product that had me concerned I would be breaking out. But that hasn't happened. What has happened is my skin is smoother and softer. The only reason I am not giving this a 5 is because it feels a little greasy for a while after I put it on. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Donna Thank you so much for the full size product. I am 52 years and I love it. Will be a loyal customer. Also use and love your hair color and cosmetics.
Ok so far Not sure how this works with clearing your complexion (been using for 2 weeks now) but does keep your skin smooth and clean.
"Great hydration while you sleep I love putting this product on after washing my face nightly. It goes on smooth, is not oily, and makes my skin feel great. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The greatest product any age. Great product for the deep South I would recommend this product for anyone. I have just turn 56 years young and I love it, so start young and watch what it will do for you as you grow."
"Softer Skin, Improved Texture I used this product along with the concentrated facial serum. I only had the opportunity to use these products for a couple of weeks, but I have definitely noticed a difference in the softness and texture of my skin. These effects were noticeable within the first few uses and they have improved significantly more with each subsequent use. I do have some fine wrinkles around my eyes that I have yet to see a difference in, but I am hopeful that this product will improve them over time. My one complaint about this product would be the scent. I found the flowery smell to be quite harsh and would prefer a unscented version or one with a more subtle fragrance. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Lightweight And Smooth I did receive this as a sample. It truly is a great product. Goes in smooth and is so lightweight. No greasy feel. Makes my skin firmer and less dry. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Nice & Light I received my samples about 4 days ago. I like Revitalift but it's a little to scented. I would rather unscented, especially for my face. Other wise it's nice light absorbs right into my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Revitalift Challenge I did the 14 day challenge. Although I did not use this twice a day for the entire challenge because its a little heavily then I would normally use. it has definitely made a difference In my complexion. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Great Product I really like using the moisturizer, but I'm not sure if it's caused me to break out more. My face is smoother and I'm going to keep using it to see if my skin improves. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Smooth Skin! I loved the results of the Revitalift challenge. My skin felt smoother and softer. My skin also seemed clearer. The texture of Revitalift was soothing for the cold weather where I live. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Better Than Expected I took the revitalift Challenge and I'm so happy I did. I don't think I would have tried it otherwise. My skin was softer and firmer after using this cream. I only wish it came in a fragance free version. While the scent isn't bad it was just as times a little strong for me. Having said that I did buy this product after the challenge was over and it is something I will continue to use. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Love It Did the 14 day challenge and really see a difference This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great Moisterizer This cream is rich and thick and a great moisterizer to help fix and prevent wrinkles. I have kind of fair dry skin and this really helps to keep it hydrated all day.
Super Creamy I think the best way to describe this moisturizer is super creamy. I am suddenly taking the time to take care of my skin. I have really enjoyed pampering myself and using this cream. Mostly I have been putting this on in the evening and I quickly forget it is there. It absorbs into the skin well and my face is definitely feeling refreshed. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"It Works In A Lot Of Areas I did 14 day challenge, it did moisturise my skin better, I still got slight dry spot on top of cheeks sometimes and in first few days got some.spots until skin got used to richness of cream, all in all now that skin has adapted, I would buy definitely as some issues I have with my skin are resolved with this cream This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smooth, Dewy & Soft! I really like the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Facial Moisturizer! I have been using it both at night and in the mornings. I apply it under my makeup and my skin feels really soft and dewy. I like that my face doest feel dry anymore, especially during the fall months. The only reason I am not giving this product 4 stars is because it has a very perfumed smell that was hard to get passed. I would recommend this product to all women who need extra moisture during the fall months. It is also great under makeup which was my favorite part. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great Benefits I tried the 14 day RevitaLift challenge and I must say I loved this cream. It was luxurious and rich but didn't leave my skin greasy. It smoothed and lifted my skin all while really moisturizing. I wil defiantly by this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Firmer I'm on day 9 of the 14 day challenge and for the most part I believe my face and neck look and feel firmer. My only dislike is the smell. It has a bit more fragrance then I prefer for being on my face. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This product works so fast and good It works good because its fast i would recomend this product because itd good for your hair and it makes it soft and it smells good

"I Love This Stuff! I have taken the 14 day Revitalift challenge and I am hooked. I only used at night after cleansing and I noticed a difference right away. I like the scent and the almost balmy texture that melts into your skin. A lot of moisturizers feel greasy after a while but not this it does actually melt into skin and doesn't feel slick after an hour or so. I am usually one to purchase cheaper products and just deal with the cons but as I age I'm changing my attitude about my skincare. I will absolutely purchase this product time and again. I love it and wish it was sold in vats. Thank you so much, it's a great product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Something Actually Works I recieved a 14 day sample, after day 4 i could see visible results.. fine lines are smoother, my face is so soft. I just ordered another bottle This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I was shocked to notice such a big improvement My mother gave this product to me and urged me to give it a try. I wasn't expecting anything to happen it was a present from Mom, and it was just another moisturizer - well, so I thought! One night I was brushing my teeth and I realized that the fine little lines above and on either side of my nose were a lot less noticeable. Then I got out the magnifying mirror and noticed that a lot of those other little creases and lines seemed shallower than before. Hate to say this, but once again, Mom was right. (BTW, love the creamy, mousse-ish texture of the product. It's not greasy at all and it feels so good when I smooth it on my face.) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Let Triple Power Do The Work For You! L'Oral's Triple Power Deep- Acting Moisturizer is a luxurious cream that delivers moisture to the skin's surface and penetrates to improve the look of aging skin. I especially like the active ingredients of Hyaluronic Acid and Pro-xylene. The fragance in the Moisturizer is pleasant yet I would suggest L'Oral cut it by half for wider acceptability among those who have allergies to fragrance in cosmetics.

Revitaift It is not as good as the tube.
Softer Skin In 2 Days I used a too powerful exfoliator that left my skin dry and uncomfortable. After using Revitalift for 2 days my skin was soft smooth. I didn't see any reduction in wrinkles but it plumped up my skin nicely This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Lifts My Sagging Jawline I am currently taking the RevitaLiftChallenge thanks to a generous sample from L'Oreal. I have several issues that I've been monitoring. I'm 1/2 way through the 2 week supply and I have definitely noticed an improvement in the skin along my jawline. I haven't seen any noticeable with dark circles or my sagging eyelids but I still have hope for that and I think it helps with undereye bags.
"Great Smoothing Moisturizer! I tried it for 2 weeks and definitely saw a difference in how smooth and moisturized my skin felt (as compared to using no facial moisturizer). I've got fairly sensitive skin, yet I was able tolerate this product very well. My only hitch was the scent. I'm sensitive to perfumes and synthetic fragrances, and while this product smelled pleasant, I was wishing it could have been more subtle, or better yet fragrance free. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love The Results I did the 14 day trial and loved the results. I can see my skin doesn't look so tired and dry around my eyes and forehead. It was a little heavier than I'm used to so had to adjust makeup. It has a lovely fragrance also. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love Revitalift!! RevitaLift makes my skin so much smoother and softer. My skin tends to be on the dry side, so this works perfectly for me! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great For Younger Women I have 4 more samples to use but up to this point I haven't seen any drastic changes in the look feel of my skin. It makes my skin feel greasy when I put foundation on top of it, it looks flaky. It does have a nice fragrance goes on smoothly. I have sensitive skin many products break my skin out but this one didn't. I think this product would probably work well for women around 30-35 who only have fine lines. Not sure I would recommend for my age group but I would recommend it for younger women. It's definitely worth trying. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love The Silky Feeling On My Skin I received a 5 day trial! I love the way my skin felt and looked. I have to get some for myself. I appreciate the 5 days to try it out. Most products give you one application....................you can't make a decision with one application of anything!
Good Moisturizer Kept skin soft and subtle.
"8574178605 Thid product lraves your face feeling smooth, soft and clean."
This is great! Love this product!
nice moisturizer I enjoyed the smell
Awesome face lotion Great product! My skin feels refreshed and younger.
RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moistuirizer made my face feel so soft and made me look younger
great job on the face I wanted to keep my face looking young
What wrinkles! Thanks for the samples. I loved how it made my skin feel and the fragrance was wonderful. I would certainly buy this product.
"supple n smooth I got samples in the mail and as long as it lasted I really liked the cream. Smooth, thick but not greasy. My face felt nice"
"great moisturizer Ive used this for almost a week , havent noticed much in wrinkle reduction yet, but it feels great on and has a nice smell."
Only used for a week I am only one week into this regime and I believe I am seeing a difference in elasticity and fewer fine wrinkles.
Love this! I loved the way it made my face feel as soon as I put it on. I could already tell a difference on my dry cheeks.
Olay age defying Love the feel n results in one day. I did recomendable to my mom n we both use it daily. I also us under eye products and i am amazed on how effective it is. I shared this with my 18 year old son cause he has dark circles due to allergies. At first he thought it wouldnt work. To his suprise after a 72 hours woohooo it started working. I am very happy to be a loyal olay customer. Completely satisfied on my end. Thank you very much for asking.
Great product Leaves my skin smooth without feeling oily. You can never start too early to prevent fine lines and wrinkles.
works great it really works great. absorbs into skin well. can't wait to try eye treatment
nice cream the first applications felt good after it was felt that only on the surface
what a difference This product made my face look and feel like a I was still in my 20's.
"very moisturizing Rich moisturizer. If you want a moisturizer that hydrates,this is it."
great stuff!!! I love it!!! It dosen't leave my skin really shiny after I apply it.
Great product I loved it. I would definately buy and use this product over saw improvements within first 3 days.
Great product. Noticed a difference the very next day. Smells great very mild. Feels great on your skin.
haven't had it too long so not sure I used it for 2 nights and it feels good on my face.
Excellent Moisturizer This is a great moisturizer. I love the texture and the scent. I didn't notice any difference in the appearance of my skin except for not being as dry.
It's really mostrizing ITS SUPER GOOD AND AMAZING I really like the packaging to I believe you should keep making this product and selling it was a little pricey but it was totally worth it.
Trying to look more youthful! I received my samples in the mail and since using them have noticed an improvement in my skin.Such a wonderful scent and makes my face feel so good.
donna Thank you so much for the full size product. I am 52 years and I love it. Will be a loyal customer. Also use and love your hair color and cosmetics.
"So far so good I am 2 days in,using this product. An already my skin looks smoother and my forehand lines seem less visible. Can't wait to see the end results!"
rich This cream was super thick. It felt great on and my skin was noticabley firmer. I would consider putting this into my reguler skin regimin.
"Great Moisturizer! I am really enjoying this moisturizer. I have fairly dry skin, especially during the winter months. This blended right into my skin nicely. It feels to me like a thicker consistancy. Some moiturizers are so light or thin that it feels like you need to re-apply it more than once to do the job."
very moisturizing I was hoping for a tightening in the jaw line but did not see that but I only used this product for 5 days. I did see a difference in the moisure in my face and the softness. I feel the 5 days may not be enough time to judge fairly as far as wrinkle improvement.
"So far, so good Have just finished trying a sample of this product and I am pleased with it. It seems to hydrate nicely and I intend to buy a full size and see how using it long term affects my skin, at which point I may increase the number of stars I award to it."
"Roll Forward!!! I bought this cream at 26.96 and now it is 29.96. Isn't Walmart trademark is they Roll Back prices, not Roll Forward. Just sayin, a little disappointed. The product itself is great though."
moisture miracle This product worked great! I have extremely dry skin and this product made all the flakes and fine lines disappear. I have been looking for a good moistureizer and with Rivitalift I found one that makes my skin appear soft and younger.
"Nice Moisturizer I had the opportunity to try this moisturizer and although I didn't get the great results that others received, I like the texture and moisturization of this product. I guess maybe I need Quadruple Power Lift. Scent is nice and fresh."
Went on smooth Went on smooth I feel like I have a new skin after showering I applied on my face and throat areas
"RevitalLift triple Power 5 Days just wasn't long enough to give a through review, I did find that the product seemed to work great , smelled nice , no greasy mess left on my face, hopefully my small lines and wrinkles will fade away with continued use."
"Blended in so well! When I appled the RevitaLift Triple Power sample I received in the mail I was impressed on how well it blended into my skin. It was like it was never there, no heavy, filmy feel afterwards. Left my skin feeling refreshed!"
Love the smooth feel! I have dry skin on my face and it is especially noticeable in the winter months. I have used the moisturizer twice so far and was very pleased with the way my face looked. It not only made my face feel smooth
I really works I purchased the RevivaLivt Triple Power a week ago. I can already see softening of wrinkles and more firmness around my jaw line. I will use it to the bottom of the jaw. I love the way it feels on my skin.
"Feels Great I love how this makes my skin feel: moisturized without being oily. My face just feels relaxed and smooth after putting this on, and the cream is nice and lightweight, not sticky like some moisturizers."
"LIKE THIS MOISTURIZER i like everything about this moisturizer...the feel, the smell, the texture, but I would like at least a 15 spf included so that I could wear it outdoors! It's perfect for cool days and nights indoors."
"RevitaLift Triple Power Smells very nice.very thick and creamy,I liked it alot,Only down side it stung alittle bit first couplr times I used it,But it definatly kept me moistuized all day"
"youthful appearance I loved this product. After the first use I could feel the the affect it had on my skin. Out of all the products I have used, I would say this is the best."
For The Love Of Your Skin I really like this product. The only thing I don't like about it is the scent. I find it too strong. I personally like scent free skin care. Other then that I love how it feels on my skin
"It works I love Loreal products and use them all the time. This cream had a different smell to it, but went away quickly. I really liked the feel of it after applying it to my face and neck."
Beautiful feeling I have loved this since it came out.feels amazing and wipes away the dull and lifeless skin.
"Works okay I received this as a sample and I must say I love getting samples. However, this is no better than any other high end moisturizer I have tried. I didn't see any lifting qualities."
Nice product Recently received samples of this product. I really don't see much of a difference so far. It does make my skin feel soft. This product does go a long way with a tiny amount.
"Skin Feels Great!! I was fortunate enough to obtain a weeks worth of samples of the RevitaLift. My skin absorbed it easily, and my skin, after a week was noticeably softer and more even toned."
"TRIPLE POWER TRIPLE GREAT I have been using the new Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer for about 10 days. I have very sensitive skin and alot of products will cause my skin to tingle and become very red, this product however has not done any of that. I feel that I am already seeing some great results, especially in the elasticity of my skin, escpecially around the jaw line and chin area..I hope to see continued results from this product."
"Moisture to the MAX! After using this product, I've noticed a firmer, smoother, more youthful appearance. My face has more volume, and feels bouncy to the touch. My slight nasal labial folds are completely smoothed out, and unnoticeable. My face is back to how it looked when I was in high school, boyish, moisturized, firm, voluminous, and line free! I LOVE this product, and would DEFINITELY be using it again!"
Very good moisturizer I really liked the thick texture of Revitalift. It was a very good moisturizer. During the winter I often get dry patches on my skin and this product really helped with that. I got to try a one week sample so I cannot say if the anti aging aspect of this product is true or not. I did notice a positive change in the texture of my skin and I will definitely use this product again.
"Softest skin! I have been using this product for about a week and a half and have already noticed a difference. Other products have burned or irritated my skin, but this one does not. When I wake my skin still feels soft and smooth, my pores seem smaller and my makeup goes on smoother. The only complaint would be the scent, it smells good, but a little too strong for the face area."
Love this moisturizer! I really wanted to start using anti aging products and when I received the sample in the mail I was very impressed. As soon as I applied the product on I started noticing a difference around my jaw and neck area. The area seemed firmer and smoother. I have been using this product daily and I am very happy with it. I use it right after I wash my face and also apply it on my neck area. The packaging is very pretty and I love the color!! It is a great product and I definitely recommend it!
"I'll be making the switch I was using another well known brand of moisurizer,but I will be switching! I love the way Revitalift makes my skin feel and look,with such little effort. I use it all over my face,even on and around the eyes.My former routine was 3 different products just for moisturizing. Revitalift is now my day and night moisturizer.In just a few days I saw wrinkles diminishing,my skin grew firmer and softer. It is not heavy,and soaks into my skin,leaving a younger,fresher,smoother feel. Nice scent"
"Moisture Love It I received a jar of ReviaLift Triple Power, Deep-Acting Moisturizer, 1st I was so surprised when I got it, 2nd I love it. My skin is always very dry nothing I have tried no matter how expensive seems to give me the hydration my face needs. Years of trying this and that and I have found my dream moisturizer, day and night. I saw a huge difference in my skin after just 4 days, and it keeps getting better, more radiant, suple, and moist. If you havent tried it buy it, you wont regret it."
Love it! This product is amazing! It tends to be really hard for me to find products that works well. Olay really helps my skin a lot!
"Love everythig except it didn't soak into my skin! I really loved the smell of it, the consistency, the feel on my face when I went to put it on, but the one thing I could not understand was why it wouldn't soak into my skin! / When I would go to put makeup over it, my foundation would slip off, and wouldn't rub onto my face... I usually LOVE all of Loreal's products, so I am not giving up on this one... maybe I put too heavy of a layer of cream on my face... I will give it another shot using less cream!"
"Nice weight, very moisturizing Found this to be a good weight for lots of moisture and seems to absorb quite quickly. Probably best as a night moisturizer. Scent is pretty strong, but I didn't find it unpleasant. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Love this product!! I just started using this product. I am in my 50's - other products either don't agree w/my skin or aren't as hydrating. I love this - I use it in the morning and then at night I use the Olay Microsculpting Serum and Cream. I'm very happy with the Olay Regenerist line!!
A Great Choice! I would have given this 5 stars but I can't get past the perfume. High quality products should be fragrance free. I do have a bias since I have sensitive skin. Other than that I highly recommend this product. The price is equal to or better than other products in its class. Give it a try today!
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer This moisturizer leaves skin feeling smooth and has a nice smell. 4 stars because it is a little heavy and oily. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Very moisturizing I was drawn to this product because it promised triple power. Instead of using 3 products this would do it all. I used it everyday for the past 2 weeks and while I don't see any dramatic results, I do think it feels and smells good. It is moisturizing and that alone is beneficial. I will continue to use it and hopefully will see more improvement in my skin."
"Great Moisture all day I received samples and tried them for the last week. Living in upstate New York in the winter moisturizer is a necessary staple. Loreal is not heavy, stickey or gummy like most. I can put this on in the morning and have soft, delicate skin all day. I have found my forever moisturizer . I should have known another Loreal product I have fallen in love with."
Triple Power Since I've received these as a sample- they have done wonders for my skin. I've even given it to my Mom and she loves it. The power of this moisturizer is that it's deep acting. Your skin feels good and it makes a difference in the other moisturizers that you use on a daily basis. I moisturize in the morning and at night for the best results.
Great Moisturizer I love the consistency and smell of this moisturizer. It's thick without feeling oily or weighing your skin down. After a week of use my skin definitely feels softer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Very good moisturizer I liked this a lot, it was a great moisturizing base under my primer before I put on my make up each day. I don't notice any skin tightening just a good old fashion moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Pleasantly surprised I've been using this for the past 2 weeks, replacing my old regiment. To start with, I have very sensitive, dry skin, with a long history of eczema (atopic dematitis) all over my body but worse of all on my face. Because of my history and knowing the vulnerabilities of my skin I first cleansed my face with a gentle cleanser, and PREPPED my skin with a layer of (no-fragrance/frills/sensitive skin) moisturizer before putting on top the Facial Serum Treatment and Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. Normally I just use my sensitive skin moisturizer alone. Immediately, from day 1, I felt an overall plumpness, brightness improve on my face. What grabs you initially however is the strong, almost over-powering fragrance of both serum and moisturizer. Not that it smells bad or anything, but it is quite strong. Sometime over-powering even my perfume. That's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. The product itself has been very effective for me. No irritation or itchiness despite my sensitive skin and the ability to keep my very dry skin moisturized throughout the day. I don't know how it would work for normal to oily type skin, but it has definitely gone beyond my expectations. I follow the regiment of Serum + Facial Moisturizer at least once a day. And although I have not noticed any significant improvements on my forehead wrinkles, the overall quality of my skin has improved to my surprise. Much more plump feeling and after initial application there is a notable brightness and clarity of my skin. I can't say that the brightness/plumpness lasts the entire span of the day, but it definitely does last for the hour or two immediately after application. Overall, I have been pleasantly surprised. Despite the strong fragrance, my very dry and sensitive skin has had no negative reactions, nor allergic flare-ups to the ingredients. I would definitely recommend and continue to use.

Great product Can't live without it is mine daily driver to having a good day
"Good moisturizer Leave skin feeling nice soft and smooth and moisturized. Would be better if it didn't leave me looking so shiny especially in my tzone were I am already oily. Also if the scent weren't so storng, doesn't really bother me but for those who are sensitive to scented product this is not for them This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Renewed and Refreshed My skin feels GREAT. I've applied the cream to my fresh face and I can feel my skin being replenished.

"Leaves me slightly oily Of the 3 products I tried, I enjoyed this one the most. I like the way my face felt for the most part. It did leave me a little more oily than usual. What I really did NOT like was that this moisturizer is heavily perfumed. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
WoW !! Pleasantly Surprised I've only been using for two (2) wks. but think I see a change in the texture of my skin. I also love how rich and creamy it is and lasts for several hours on my skin. I sometimes use it 3X a day. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

After a few days Well I have been using this for a few days now and my skin feels much softer to the touch as well as firm.

Thick lotion smooth.. I think this lotion is great especially for the winter. it is a little thick so little bit goes a long way and you have to really rub it in. I think it's better it's for winter when skin us more dry. It does smell nice and makes my face soft and radiant. Goes nice after using the serum . This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great for night use I love what this does to my skin. It feels so soft and smooth when I wake up. I tried using it during the day but it's a bit too thick and didn't completely absorb into my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Long Lasting I used the Loreal RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum and the Triple Power Concentrated Facial Treatment and 40 hours later I have begun to notice that my dry spots are only just beginning to feel dry again!

After 1 week of use my face is much smoother and looks healthy. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
RevitaLift Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer This is a very thick product that had me concerned I would be breaking out. But that hasn't happened. What has happened is my skin is smoother and softer.

Good job L'Oral! I like the products a lot. I was surprised because I was sure it would cause an allergic reaction but it didn't. My skin felt smoother and plumper after a few days. The only thing I don't love is that it is highly scented. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

The night cream My experience with the deep power night cream was great. It felt rich and was deeply moisturizing. A little goes a long way. I used it in the morning as well under the day lotion. I love the benefits. It made my skin radiant and plumper. When used in conjunction with the serum I could see the lift. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Nice and light Nice, light and not too heavy for my skin. I'm not a fan of the scent. Very light, but floral. It seems to go well with the facial serum, doesn't plug pores. It gets along very well with my skin type. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

L'Oreal RevitaLift Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I loved how easy to use and how light it felt on my skin. The words deep-acting on my combination skin made me worried but there was no reason to worry at all.

"Deep moisture I love the smell of this cream. It's not heavy and you feel fresh. I apply the deep moisturizer when I'm not leaving the house. Halloween weekend it came very handy after washing my facial makeup that made me feel icky, sticky. Very little of the cream covers my face and neck. I love this cream.

"This product is great I was able to try this product and I noticed my skin looked firmer after use. I also noticed an smoother look to my skin.

"Worked great so far I think this works great ! The weather has changed and my skin gets so dry n cracks when I wear my foundation, so I always need a thick moisturizer. The first time I used this it immediately turned my skin soft not greasy. Next day I used it under my makeup. My face looked good. So this was a great product my faces is also a little tighter. Loved this ! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"L'Oral RevitaLift Facial Moisturizer I really like this product! It is very rich in texture and feels cool on the skin. I have normal to dry skin and I can definitely feel it my skin soak up the product. It doesn't feel greasy, but when applying it feels a little heavy but once it drys, weightless. A great everyday moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer If I could describe this moisturizer in just one word it would be: luxurious. Immediately my dry skin was no longer flaky! After just one use! Not only did it help hydrate my skin and give it a nice smooth and soft texture, it smells great while doing it. The only thing I didn't like was it would sometimes get clump-like... Feeling the product ball up on my face. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Best drug store cream I have been using this cream for 2 months now,it smells really good fells nice when initially applied and makes skin look good, I actually returned 140 jar of Chanel to use this instead. I have since stopped using it and gone to Shishedo Bio Performance Super Revitalizing cream because of the amount of waxes used in Loreal, when I would wake in the morning my face felt very artificial as if it was covered in candle wax, to bad Loreal, but for a budget user for 19.99 when price matched against Shoppers drug mart it is a really great performing cream just couldn't handle that waxy feel the next day. Guess I'll just stick with my Shishedo for now! Hope this helps."
Check this out! I have been using the L'Oreal Paris Deep Acting Moisturizer for about a week now. I have dry and oily parts to my face. And now I don't thanks to L'Oreal. My face fells like it all belongs together. No more combination skin. My face feels smoother and looks firmer. The puffiness under my eyes has been reduced. I actually can't wait to see the differences in one more week. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Super Creamy I think the best way to describe this moisturizer is super creamy. I am suddenly taking the time to take care of my skin. I have really enjoyed pampering myself and using this cream. Mostly I have been putting this on in the evening and I quickly forget it is there. It absorbs into the skin well and my face is definitely feeling refreshed. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
i lovethis product so much! it really helps because of the consistoncy and really moisturizes
Great night time moisturizer I used this product in conjunction with the Serum and it was great. I woke up with my face smoother and very soft. It is non-greasy and goes on very well. It was absorbed into my skin quickly and I was not left with the feeling that my face still had lotion left on it. The smell is quite pleasant also and not too overpowering. I look forward to seeing the long term affects of this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great daytime moisturizer This is a perfect daytime moisturizer paired with the L'Oreal Revitalift Serum. I tend to have dry skin and this has definitely regulated my skin. I have used this product for 2 weeks now and have noticed more even skin and subtle tightening of the skin. Would definitely recommend this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I like the way the product wet on, I tried it on the back of my hand first - checking for any kind of a reaction. The next day, I tried a small portion of my face - just to make sure. I am pleased with the way it felt, etc. So, today I used it on my whole face and it was fine, I LOVE it so far!! I'll keep using it and the rest of the products to see how well they work :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Face cream I really liked this product. It smelled good, goes on smooth, and really moisturizes. Not greasy. Easy and no mess at bedtime. Dries enough to wear under my makeup. Without cream, my face is dry and flaky. Not a problem after using this product daily. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love the moisturizer After trying the moisturize for a few days...I'm loving how it keeps my skin moisturized. I generally have combination dry skin but this really kept the dryness at bay. The consistency is just right. It's not runny or to solid. It applies to the skin perfectly. I would consider switching moisturizers for this one. It's very light on the skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Good cream When I first tried I thought, ok another cream for wrinkles But I change my mind when I tried because the good thing about this cream is that's your face is not grease and have a great smell.

"Softer Skin After using L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for one week, my skin is feeling the effects. My skin is softer, and small dry patches have disappeared. The moisturizer smells good, and feels nice going on. It is not heavy, or watery, just right. I will definitely continue to use this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A little bit heavy but good I found this lotion a bit heavy, so I used it as a night cream, even though they said it's for day or night. That's my only complaint, though. Otherwise, it does remove fine lines and wrinkles as promised. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Rich luxurious moisture After the first time trying the night cream, I felt immediate smoothness to my skin. It was a thick cream but went on smoot had a nice scent.

4048197640 This product is perfect! I use it on a daily basis. The moisturizer makes my skin feel soft and leaves a beautiful shine
"Very thick and moisten your face. This is a rather thick cream. It comes in a jar and little dab will be enough if you don't like it very thick on your skin. I have a combination skin, so it gives me a little oily feeling around my chin and nose when I put it on. It is perfect for the cold dry air during the winter.

Skin feels firmer and I like that look I have been using this product for a little over a week now. I love that it provides sun protection. It feel great under my makeup and my skin feels firmer.

Deep action I've tried all 3 as a whole. The first day I wasn't sure what to think. Because as it started to work my face was a little tingly.

"Was sceptical, but was happy with the results. I have used this product for a week. It goes on smooth, and feel wonderful. There isn't that greasy feeling, or heavy feeling.

"Where have you been all my life I have never been a big moisturizer user, that was until I tried this product.It is non greasy which is a huge plus. It's smooth and does not have a strong fragrance . I noticed a difference within a week in my skin and how it had a glow to it and how it felt as if it was tightening up. This is now a part of my daily facial routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"smells so good After using the serum I applied the moisturizer. So far I love everything about it from the texture to the smell. It applied very easly and is non greasy. I used a qtip to get it out of the jar the one thing Im not a fan of is opened jars because I feel like it can easily grow bacteria,especially when people stick their fingers in it. I also took a before picture and cant wait to see what my skin looks like after. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Not Greasy So I've tried the moisturizer and it is not greasy which is a huge plus, makes your face soft and smooth. It has a subtle smell so you don't mind it going on your face, I payed extra attention to my forehead as thats the place with the most problems, Ive noticed throughout the time it has been on it has stayed moisturized and I will continue to use the product along with the others to see the end results This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So Far - So Good! I've used this moisturizer every day for the past two weeks and while I haven't noticed any dramatic effects I do see a change in the texture of my skin. I like the way this moisturizer feels and smells. It's rich, creamy and easy to apply (a small amount goes a long way). It's thick but absorbs quickly. And most importantly, it's not greasy! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A great product, with a strong smell First, I want to say that this moisturizer does its job beautifully. My skin felt immediately hydrated and smooth. The smell is a bit stronger than the other products that I've tried in the Revitalift line. As someone who is highly sensitive to perfume, it did bother me some. I doubt I will use this in the future, although for people who are not bothered by perfume, I would absolutely recommend it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Omg You skin is 100 better thank u I will use it for ever and spread the word
"Deep Acting Moisturizer Its been several days of usage now, both day and night, for the Deep - Acting Facial Moisturizer. I can notice that my overall skin texture is much much better! When I wake up in the morning my skin feels great and is noticeably more even toned. This moisturizer does have a light scent which I enjoy as it makes me feel clean and fresh. I definitely recommend giving it a try! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Quality Moisturizer. The RevitaLift deep-acting moisturizer has a thick consistency that absorbs into the skin, leaving it refreshed and moisturized. I have used this product alone and with the RevitaLift serum, and either way it feels heavy on my skin. I thought at first that it felt that way because it was used in combination with the serum, but even when I tried it alone, it felt like it sat on top of my skin for a long time. Once it's absorbed, the skin feels soft and refreshed, but if you need something that's quick, this might not work for your routine. Also, the first time I used this it was in my morning routine and after 3-5 minutes of letting it settle into my skin, I put my make-up primer on only to have it all roll off in little clumps on my fingers! I use an expensive primer that I use sparingly, so I don't feel it was the amount used, I think it's a bad combination of the gel-based primer and moisturizer together. Pros: The pros are that a little goes a LONG way. I used the moisturizer for 7 days and literally just used what was on the lid. It's a thick, creamy, lightly-scented moisturizer that I look forward to putting on my skin. Cons: The cons are that it takes a while to absorb into the skin - I've made this a part of my nightly skincare routine only because my mornings tend to be fast-paced. It doesn't mix well with my make-up primer, meaning its limited to when I am not going to wear make-up, but that's not a deal breaker for me. Overall, the product is as effective as some of the more expensive products I've tried and once absorbed into the skin, its effects are noticeable. My skin feels and looks refreshed.

"L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Triple Power Dee-Acting Facial Moisturzer I really liked this product from the moment I applied it to my face and neck. It was not greasy and a little went a long way. I used it with L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment. I had a dry spot on the bridge of my nose and it went away with three days using both products. I have used it for three weeks and my skin feels great. Cannot say that my wrinkles have disappeared, but for 71, it has softened them. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loving It! I was thinking about purchasing a new anti aging product right before this campaign became available. I used this deep moisturizer applying the serum. I feared the combination of products would feel too heavy and greasy on my skin. But I was wrong, it has left my face feeling smooth and refreshed. I would recommend this product. Giving 4 stars so far, as I have not used it long enough to determine it's before and after results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Excellent for night Time Use This L'oreal Facial Moisturizer is really great for the overnight hours. It goes to work and leaves your skin feeling really refreshed in the morning. Has a nice soothing scent and isn't greasy. While I can't say that my skin has less lines or more tightness, it is very hydrated and looks fresh, and at my current age, that's good for me. May have even better effects over time. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
My skin felt nice! I trird the Deep-Acting Moisturizer along the the serum before bed. My skin felt well hydrated soft when I woke up in the morning. It has a nice clean scent to it. I have sensitive skin I did notice a redness to my skin and I had to be very careful not to get it too close to my eyes or my eyes tended to be irratated and they would water. I would recommend this product for a night moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Good Facial Moisturizer I really like this facial moisturizer. It has a very pleasant scent, not too strong. It comes in a nice size jar, and will last because you don't need a lot. I really like how smooth it feels, not greasy or oily. I have been using on my entire face. It makes it feel very smooth. I have had to use lightly on my chin due to some acne breakouts. I like that this product is affordable. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Triple power facial serum and deep acting facial moisturizer I am still undecided about these products and continue to use them. I think I see some improvement in my skin but not positive yet. It has been about 3 weeks now and I think my skin tone has improved and one wrinkle between my brows seems less. The only thing I do not like is the products seems to block my pores, when I sweat I feel very greasy and more uncomfortable than usual so I may just use it at night.

Let Triple Power do the work for you! L'Oral's Triple Power Deep- Acting Moisturizer is a luxurious cream that delivers moisture to the skin's surface and penetrates to improve the look of aging skin. I especially like the active ingredients of Hyaluronic Acid and Pro-xylene. The fragance in the Moisturizer is pleasant yet I would suggest L'Oral cut it by half for wider acceptability among those who have allergies to fragrance in cosmetics.

"Good Stuff The deep-acting facial moisturizer is pretty good. I liked how it felt on my skin when I was putting it on. I could tell the difference in how my skin felt after using it all this time. The moisturizer smells good, though just a tad overpowering. However, the smell does get less immediately after pouring it on. I have had the experience of it peeling though. Over all, it's a great product. It's worth using it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
great for after sun love using after being in the sun and on the water all day along with daily use cooling and give moisture to weathered skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great primer! This moisturizer has a tacky feel on the skin and it helps my foundation stay on all day
"Facial Moisterizer Beautiful packaging, but I prefer a pump type product that I dont have to put my fingers into. This product does not have sunscreen, so I've only used it at night. It went on smoothly over the serum, but I did notice some exfoliating effect shortly after applying. I have used the product for one week, however I haven't seen any remarkable difference in my skins appearance. I wanted to know this said it was for day or night, yet it contained no SPF. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal revitalift I really like this product.. while I'm not positive I see a difference in the look of my skin so much, I love the feel and fragrance of this cream. I especially like it at night. I have used this cream in tandem with the revitalift serum and find it works nicely. It has a much thicker and luxurious feel than most creams I have used and I feel that it is moisturizing my skin. It is definitely a product I would buy and use daily. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Beautiful, silky feeling moisturizer There is no other way to describe this than to say it feels this like silk. I've never had a lotion feel this way. Luxurious in feel and look. Even the container is beautiful. You feel as if you are using high end skin care. It's amazing stuff. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and super soft. The only thing I dont like about this product is the scent. The scent is rather strong and lingers for some time. It does not dissipate fast. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Very effective! I tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLife Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. I'm used to a lighter type of moisturizer, so I found that a little of this product goes a long way. I was happy with the way this product moisturized my face. It went on smooth, with no greasy feel. It also absorbed into my skin quickly and left a smooth finish. I would recommend this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"feeling very moisturized This hydrates my skin perfectly, so much so that I don't need my face cream. If you have oily skin, it might be too much for you. After two weeks my skin is more even and my makeup goes on super smooth on my former rough patches. The smell is nice, clean and crisp. I highly recommend this, especially for those looking for a good product on the cheap. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good for acne prone skin This cream is something I can use nightly and not get a greasy face that starts breaking out. I typically cannot use moisturizers because I always break out, but after a week of using this on problems. I can see that my face is looking healthier with it and I don't have any dry flaky patches. I am excited to see how this looks after long-term use. The only thing I didn't like was it smells really strongly like perfume. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great deep moisturizer I've been using this for a couple weeks now. I use this at night before bed. It really soaks right in and doesn't leave a greasy feeling. It has been great with the cold weather which usually makes my skin very dry. I haven't experienced any dry skin. I gave this 4 stars because I haven't noticed any tightness or wrinkles reduced with this. It's a great moisturizer and leaves skin silky. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Smooth Moisturizer I have to say that I love the benefits that this product has: repair wrinkles, re-firm and redensify. And it has made my skin firm. My only issue with it, is that it flaked off when I first used it. However, it does make my skin feel hydrated and radiant. Other than that, it doesn't cause irritation, and it is a great product. I look forward to seeing great results after every usage! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Seems like a good brand. Smoothed lines on my face. I really like the jar that this moisturizer came in. As far as the Triple Power 3-step regime is concerned, though, I'm not sure what this step is doing. I think the first step, the serum, does the most work and the last two steps are moisturizer, which doesn't seem completely necessary. I really like how this cream smells and feels good on my face. My face looks better, but I'm not sure this is what is doing it This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Perfect together I think that the deep acting moisturizer pairs awesome with the other products in the same line, they do not tend to get overly greasy which is HUGE with moisturizer. It doesn't cause you to break out which is a major problem I personally was having. I have already recommended this product to many people and I will continue to do so. As well as buy more for myself! I am so happy i was able to product test this and voice my opinion, I think alot of people will benefit from this! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This product is incredible This product is incredible because it always feels like you are wearing it all over you but mainly your face. Thank you for making this product.
Not a Heavy Moisturizer L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is similar to other overnight moisturizers I have tried a bit heavy. I used this with the serum at night and needed to give my face extra time to dry. The results were good with my forehead wrinkles not showing up as much. The scent was pleasant and did not feel it was overpowering. This product will be found in my future shopping cart. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Another great product Love this one also. This can be used day and night. A little heavier and prefer to use at night. Although I did use it both morning and night for awhile. Noticeable difference in only a few weeks. Skin is smoother and feels very soft. Wrinkle/frown lines look better. Only gave 4 of 5 stars because not me but some may be bothered by the smell of the product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Products that work, Great!!! however.... I used this product for about 10 days. When you apply it, it feels great, its thick but not cakey, however I do have oily skin and I feel that it is a bit oily and shiny, when I rubbed the product a bit too much it would roll off my fingers. It also does have similar ingredients to other moisturizers I have used with sunscreen. But the feel is great. It works great, smells wonderful, and most importantly I see my skin is smoother and tighter, and it does moisturize well. So woohooo!! thumbs up. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I like the way L'Oreal Paris Revitalift's Triple Power Moisturizer feels on my skin! This is not your typical moisturizer! I am now a woman in my early 40's. So, I expect my moisturizer to work overtime and provide an extra barrier of protection for my skin from the sun and the elements automatically. In addition, I need my skin to feel supple and smoothe as well to the touch like it did in my 20's! This product helps do the job. It prevents dryness and helps add moisture to my skin and face where needed!! I love it. I also like the fact that it has SPF already added as well. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Creamy, smooth and refreshing I simply love this moisturizer for night time use. I put it on after washing my face at the end of each day. The moisturizer goes on cream and smooth without a heavy, greasy feeling. It is absorbed quickly so you don't feel like it's being rubbed of onto your pillows at night. I didn't use it during the day because I use L'Oreal's Facial Day Lotion, but it can definitely be used because it is not heavy. I highly recommend this if you are looking for a light moisturizer that works. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Intense Moisturizing I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power system for 1 1/2 weeks now. I have noticed a great improvement in the moisture and brightness of my skin. My skin is soft all day long and my makeup goes on smoother after applying the serum and moisturizers. I have not noticed much of a difference in fine lines but I didn't have many to begin with. Also, these products have a nice, light fragrance. I would continue to use these products, especially the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal Paris Revital Lift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is Delightful! I love this product. It is so enjoyable to use. It smells wonderful. And a little goes a long way. It is hard to evaluate how well a product will work after only a short amount of time. But I do notice a softening of my skin and a slight improvement of fine lines. I am happy to be a part of this campaign. I look forward to using this until it is all gone! It feels so nice, it is not at all irritating to my skin and leaves me with a dewy feel and glow. Love it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Good for Sensitive Skin I think this product is really good. I have been using it twice a day for over a week now and I do feel like my skin is softer though I am not sure if there is anything noticeable in terms of looking more youthful. I appreciate that it does not really have a scent but what I like about it the most is that it has not irritated my extremely sensitive skin at all. I have had no problem using this product for the last week and would consider purchasing it when I run out. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"I'm loving this stuff To start with, this stuff smells great. Very lightly scented, not overwhelming at all. I love the texture, too. It goes on nicely and makes my skin feel great. I've been using it for about 2 weeks and right off the bat I noticed how soft and smooth my skin felt. Just recently I've been seeing my skin tone has been evening out. My only complaint would be my skin did get oily for a while. I had to cut back on my use and is seemed to have gotten better. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Super Moisturizer It did an excellent job of adding and trapping extra moisture into my skin. I applied it nightly for 6 days. The day/night moisturizer is the perfect combination of thick and creamy. It absorbed instantly leaving my skin feeling softer and, more importantly, appearing more radiant. I gave the product 4 stars because it did not have any impact on my thankfully, few wrinkles. I will continue to use the product to see if there will be other positive changes with long-term application. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great Moisturizer I have used this brand for over 15 years and I like the way it makes my skin feel and the price was fabulous compared to the price elsewhere
"Smooth, Dewy Soft! I really like the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Facial Moisturizer! I have been using it both at night and in the mornings. I apply it under my makeup and my skin feels really soft and dewy. I like that my face doest feel dry anymore, especially during the fall months. The only reason I am not giving this product 4 stars is because it has a very perfumed smell that was hard to get passed. I would recommend this product to all women who need extra moisture during the fall months. It is also great under makeup which was my favorite part.

"okjkenda57 I am a bit older that maybe some and I thought why not try these products the L 'Oreal Paris Revitalift facial moisture and was pleasantly surprised I am kind of picky with these types of products as some leave your skin oily or they feel greasy - this product was neither of those things it felt light and creamy and did wonderfully in the dryer spots on my face --- I have used it for about 10 days and my face does look brighter and I love the end result fr I hope to continue to see progess , my face fells fuller and looks like it is glowing This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Better than I expected I have acne prone skin. I was very nervous trying this product because I did not know if it would make my acne worse. After only one day, I woke up to my acne spots were so much smaller and kess noticeable! I know its supposed to help fine lines and wrinkles but it really helps with acne, too. I Liked the clean smell of the product, and it was not greasy or oily. It left my face feeling great, and it really dissolved into my skin and didn't just sit on my skin like other products. My face was super soft when I woke up this morning. I would buy Loreal Revitalift! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Excellent moisturizer but too much fragrance I immediately fell in love with the texture and the excellent moisturizing properties in this cream. It felt so luxurious ,just like a high-end expensive cream, but I couldn't get past the heavy scent that lingered. I applied the cream at night after cleansing and woke up to toned and hydrated supple skin. Never felt heavy or greasy after applying, and that makes it absolutely wonderful to me to use as a night cream. The only down side to this product is the scent. Why add so much I understand a slight scent, but this is way too much for my taste. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Ultra moisturizer This is a jar of ultra thick moisturizer. I have combination skin so I was worried that it would be too much for my oily t zone, but it was amazing. It made my skin ultra soft, had a great scent and created a glow. I use it in the morning and night and seems to be evening out my skin tone. It also seemed to be a great primer for my makeup routine. The only thing in my opinion that would make it better would be if they put some acne fighting medication in it as well since most of us still have some spots at every age that we'd like to get rid of.

"Luxurious Moisturizing Cream without Heavy or Greasy Feel! Luxurious Moisturizing Cream without Heavy or Greasy Feel! Usually a cream that feels this great leaves a residue on my face. This cream absorbed very quickly let my face feeling soft and smooth. Very light weight on the skin and non--greasy! I was very surprised! I tend to have combination skin with some oil around my nose area and just did not make my skin oily at all! The only thing that I would like is a different container. I don't like that I open the lid and I'm putting my finger or a cotton swab into it, because I feel that the product is exposed to the air and contaminates. Other than that, I love it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Smells great I'm super excited about this I've had my eye on it for a while and it's been in my cart several times but I always end up putting it back cuz well I've got kids. I love the smell. It's not greasy and it doesn't feel like your wearing a mask either. It's not sticky and it absorbed quickly. I can feel instantly when I put it on a sort of tightening affect. A little goes a long way and I love how the serum has a hint of shimmer to it. My skin feels soft after and well I just love it and this is a product I will be keeping in my cart until I get to the register because sometimes moms deserve to be pampered a bit and look their best.

"One of the best lotions I've tried! This lotion is awesome!! It really soaks deep into your skin. I have a lot of problems with lotions making my face itch because it's super sensitive. This whole set did not do that!! I have super flaky skin, so I try any lotion that is supposed to be thicker this one really helped with the dryness of my skin. My routine is to wash my face, dry, apply serum, then apply the deep-acting facial moisturizer. Now that we are going into the cold months, I'll apply this over the triple power day lotion. I have been able to get my daughter mother to use this trio of products both love them! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great moisturizer! Usually, my face is a mix of oily and dry, but this really helped with my dry skin (which I focused more on) without making my face feel greasy! It felt light underneath of my make-up and that is really important because I apply make-up everyday for work and it tends to dry my face out. I've tried so many different moisturizers, but this one worked really well! The only reason that I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is that I wasn't a huge fan of the smell. It was a bit strong for me - especially being applied to my face. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great product but not for me I started to use this regimen and actually bought the cleanser to get the complete experience. The reason I don't think the product is for me is because I broke out on day 3 of using it. Now I know that this can happen when you begin a new skin care treatment and yes I could've waited it out maybe but I broke out alot around my chin area mostly. The reason Im still giving this a 4 star is because I gave the product to my mother and she absolutely loves it. She noticed visible changes within a few days and is excited about continuing with the products. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Amazing product This product it's amazing because it makes your skin feel younger
"A little goes a long way... I used this product after putting on the serum every night after washing my face. It is very heavy, so I only liked to use it at night. I did enjoyed the smell, but if you like little to no fragrance this is not for you. I feel like I noticed fewer lines after using both products for a few weeks, and my face seemed to have more even coloring. I think it's too heavy to wear during the day and will leave a greasy feeling. A little dab of this product goes a long way. However, the end result was a softer, moisture rich, and even complexion for my and that made me happy! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This stuff works! I've been using this product for a little over a week now and for I'm loving it! After two days of use I noticed how soft and smooth my skin felt. I had some dry patches and they just disappeared. But was replaced with oily skin :( I think fixed it though. I believe I was using too much, I've cut back on the amount and so far it seems to have gotten better. I don't think I have younger looking skin, but it hasn't been the full 4 weeks, there's still time. The scent is pleasant, not over powering at all! Excited to continue using this in hopes that it will work as advertised! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good as a night moisturizer A week ago I starting using the L'OREAL Deep-Acting Moisturizer as a night lotion. I think it is too greasy to use it during the day. It is perfect for night time though. I am 45 and my skin feels very smooth and looks well hydrated after using it. The scent is not unpleasant. I am also using it on my neck and decolletage. I have not noticed anything regarding my forehead wrinkles or the fine lines around my eyes. But I have used it only for a week, it probably needs more time to see a difference in wrinkles. I have also sensitive skin and have no issues with this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Leaves skin feeling soft I was surprised how much I found I like this moisturizer. I found my skin felt softer even after 1 use. I also felt that my skin was slightly firmer as well due to having Hyaluronic Acid which helps combat signs of aging. I am more than pleasantly surprised on how non-greasy it feels on my face. I think L'Oral Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer works just as well as some of the higher end brands. I also feel it works even better as part of the Triple Power regiment with the serum and lotion. I would highly recommend all 3 products together in any woman looking to combat signs of aging.

Very good Moisturizer L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer leaves my skin feeling fresh and smooth for the whole day! This is a great base for makeup. I just use compact powder on the moisturizer and I see no shine or greasiness for a minimum of 7 hours. My skin feels fresh and no breakouts yet which I am very happy about. I have been using it only for about a week now so I'm not sure if it's working for wrinkles and tightening but I will try it for another week and update. Overall a very good product. I recommend this to anyone looking for fresh and clean look. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Another good one! I had my doubts when I tried this product, but after using it every morning and night for over three weeks now, I can honestly tell a difference in my skin! It's definitely smoother more moisturized. Maybe even a little brighter too! I thought it would break me out since aI have sensitive and oily skin, but it didn't at all! As far as absorbing into my skin, it took a little bit of time, but nothing too crazy. Sometimes I could still feel the product on my skin pulling away from the pillowcase if I was laying on my side.

Positive moisturizing results I use the L'Oreal Paris revitalift Triple Power deep acting facial moisturizer in conjunction with the facial serum treatment. I would first use the facial serum treatment followed by the moisturizer. I had a very positive experience with the moisturizer. I found it to be thick but upon application did not feel heavy upon my face. I use both these products everyday for the past 3 weeks and have noticed and overall General reduction in the wrinkles and smoothness of my skin. It is a product I would consider continue using for my facial needs. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Triple Power Moisturizer This product contains parabens, so if I looked at in on the store shelf i would pass it, because i am trying to steer clear of that, but because i have seen subtle results in 5 days, i would now consider buying this. This moisturizer is very thick, so it will be good to use during the winter months. When putting this on it felt almost like velvet and was absorbed by my face very well. This is too heavy for me to wear in the morning underneath my foundation, it made my makeup look ashy, but I do put it on before bed after the Triple Power Serum, and when I wake up, my skin feels super soft. I will continue to try this product to see if my laugh lines will get less noticeable. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Finally a product that works I've been trying to find the best wrinkle reducer on the market and it has been very hectic. I went into Loreal's Revitalift thinking ANOTHER BOMB. But, I tried these products and did exactly what the instructions stated. I didn't miss a day. And what I found was a product that actually works. These products, Serum, Day Moisture and Deep Moisturizer, do what they say. All three have Hyaluronic Acid in them. I don't know if that is what the key is, but I do know my skin has gotten tighter, smoother, dark spots are fading and my wrinkles are reduced. I was amazed that a drug store product can do what this does. Good Job L'Oreal. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Non greasy moisturizer- excellent for sensitive skin I am in my early 30's and have been using the L'Oral Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment, and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 for 10 days now and so far I am pleased with the results: Pros: This moisturizer is wonderful for sensitive skin- it's also non greasy, and fast absorbing. I've noticed my skin is smoother and well hydrated after trying these products for 10 days. Since my skin is hydrated I also noticed less fine lines near my eyes. Con: The cream is a moderately strong scented product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Good product This product smells amazing because it's good into skin I used this product almost 7 years now and I love the lotion for the face also
"Long lasting moisture! I really like this product because coupled with the serum applied at night, I felt that my skin stayed moisturized through the night and day. It spreads very well, has a light scent that disappears in minutes and does not feel heavy or greasy on my skin. It deserves 3 stars, but I gave the product four stars because it was the only product out of the three that I felt did something- something being it moisturized. I didn't notice any changes in refirming or redensifying my skin, but I do like the product. I probably would not buy again unless after finishing the jar I notice something that really does it for my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Rich and creamy moisturizer The L'Oral Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer felt very rich and creamy. Even though I applied a thin layer on my face it felt thick and heavy. It was also very fragrant which I thought could sometimes be overwhelming. However, after the first week of using this moisturizer I noticed that my skin felt smoother to the touch. After 3 weeks my skin felt and looked somewhat firmer. However, I would like more time to actually confirm this statement. I applied the moisturizer in the morning after I cleansed my face and again at night after I cleansed my face before bedtime. Based on the results of this moisturizer I would definitely recommend it. The thickness and fragrance wouldn't be enough of a negative for me not to recommend it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I used this product along with the serum as recommended on the packaging. At first I did not like the way this product felt combined with the serum. It felt heavy on my skin, and a little bit goopy, so I wasn't expecting to end up liking it as much as I did. After about 2 minutes of allowing the product to dry, the heavy, goopy feeling disappears, leaving your skin feeling very soft and refreshed. I thought that if I were to continue to use these products, I would have to do so separately at different times of day, but I was pleasantly surprised that they ended up working so well together! My only complaint with this set of products is the scent. I'm very sensitive to scents, so even the lightest one can be overpowering to me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So far, so good So far, I've really like this moisturizer. I use it at night and wake up to super soft skin. However, sometimes I feel like I can still feel it on my face once I wake up, like it wasn't completely absorbed. Not sure if that's a bad thing or not. But I'm still liking it althought it hasn't been a miracle worker or anything. I haven't really noticed a decrease in wrinkles or sun spots, but my skin has been soft and clear, and I'm super happy with that. This has the same scent as the other two products in this line, the serum and day lotion, which is quite frangrant. It's not a bad smell, I actually rather like it, but if someone is sensitive to smells, this may be too much for them. Just something to keep in mind.

Love it! I saw a noticable difference in my skin within a week!
tried revitalift instant absorption non greasy didn't blur my vision
"Oily T-Zone Balancing Act Beginning from the beginning, the packaging is beautiful to me. A bit reminiscent of some Olay or Avon products, but no matter, it looks quite prestige. The jar you get with this product is indeed not full to the brim but you only need a dollop on the tip of your finger, dotted about the face and massaged in to apply. The first scent I got was of a fresh floral arranged study or a window box. It was lovely, however, once mixed with skins natural oils, it became a bit too sweet and soapy smelling. This disappates after an hour or so. Applying this in the morning after my face washing routine, I did not need to blot until around happy hour. It, in concert with other products in this line, balanced my oily t-zone (a near miracle). As with any product I test, I like to try to take as much of the time allotted to give the product a REAL go. I get to see how it reacts during mentrual cycles, during different weather, stress, and long days or nights. This product held up like a poised socialite and didn't break a sweat haha. You will enjoy this moisturizer, it isn't too thick, especially now as it gets cooler outside, and leaves your face feeling...cared for. This one is a go buy.

"Seems to be working I've been trying these products for about a week now and I could already see and feel some improvements for sure. The first day I wasnt impressed. It left residue on my face and it tingled and itched. But I probably didn't wash my face well enough. So I gave it another shot. A little goes a long way with this moisturizer I just Dan my finger in the jar twice and that's all I need for my entire face and neck. This one is very creamy so it takes a little longer to dry and absorb into the skin. It feels a bit sticky and thick until it really absorbs into your skin, after that my skin feels fine! It tingles a little still. If you don't like scented products this isn't the products for you because the have a strong perfume smell. The smell doesn't bother me. I have been putting it on every morning before I put my makeup and it has been a good moisturizer to prep my skin. I haven't been as consistent at night but I've been trying! I've noticed that my skin looks noticeably brighter and feels very smooth. It has done nothing for my dark circles but they are hereditary so I want ejecting any changes. I am going to continue to use these products and see where it gets me! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A regular/standard moisturizer The moisturizer has the same consistency than other regular creams available in the Pharmacy. Is a heavy, oily and thick cream. I used it twice a day, in the morning and night. After Serum (Include neck). Nice scent, not heavy perfumed. And mild for use in sensitive skin (like me). After the serum, moisturizer, sunscreen I applied face primer, liquid base and powder. A lot of coats in my face but nevertheless, didn't feel too heavy or the skin breathless. So many products don't caused skin break outs. My only complaint, it's the oily and shine look during the rest of the day. Need to retouch the face with blotting Paper or Oil Control Powder. That's a con for the product. It's a good/regular product to consider to buy in the future, have a nice price. Really accessible. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Deeply moisturizing, feels great! After thoroughly trying out the L'Oral RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer, I have to say that I've very much enjoyed both the instant results (deeply moisturized, not sticky or greasy, skin feels smooth and soft) and the results seen over time (skin looks and feels more plump, fine lines visibly reduced). I am looking forward to continued use and even better results. I do have two areas in which I am not happy with the product, however. Those areas would be that it is unclear whether or not the product is cruelty-free and that is something that is important to me. Also, I am not a fan of the very strong fragrance. It is kind of overwhelming and it actually gives me a slight headache until it wears off. In my opinion, facial products do not need to be fragranced! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
best ever best ever . never a second thought about buying this brand
"Fan of the Moisturizer! I've been using this product for about a week now and I've noticed a difference in hydration and firmness! It smells nice and surprisingly absorbs rather quickly. You're supposed to use it morning and night and as I have combo skin I was REALLY hesitant to use it in the morning. I get greasy by the end of the day already so I normally stay clear of super thick products like this to start my day... but I gave it a shot anyway. Oh my goodness, I was SHOCKED it absorbed so quickly and didn't leave a greasy residue! It literally goes on like thick chunks of vaseline but instantly disappears into your skin. Unbelievable! Unfortunately I've also had some odd breakouts since using this line of products, however I'm not sure if it's related or not. So far I'm enjoying the moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great Moisterizer This cream is rich and thick and a great moisterizer to help fix and prevent wrinkles. I have kind of fair dry skin and this really helps to keep it hydrated all day.
"Deep Acting Moisturizer So far so good. I've been using this for a few days now and it seems to be a keeper. Not sure that it is getting rid of lines, but my skin seems a little smoother."
fingers crossed.. I started using a week ago and so far-so good.. I have noticed some firming and lines are becoming less noticeable. So I will continue and see where it takes me..
I really liked this moisturizer. I liked this moisturizer. I thought it absorbed quickly and didn't leave a film on my skin. It also smelled nice and I would recommend it to other women.
Noticible difference in fine lines and wrinkles. This product definatly helped with fine lines and wrinkles. Would be my favorite if it also helped with dark spots.
"Power concentrated L'Oreal facial serum I think there has been some improvement in the wrinkle department . I am not sure why one needs to use two separate products twice a day. It is a lot of cream on my face, and in the second photo you may see that my face, especially my cheeks get quite red after application. That worries me a bit. Also the fragrance is a bit strong for my nose, but it is a good one, just a little less would be good. The two products go on easily and seem to penetrate the skin right away. The jar for the Deep acting moisturizer may look nice, but the square top is not as easy to open and close.i am only able to submit one photo, but a previous one show MORE wrinkles than this one (after 2 weeks of application) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smooth Skin I'm 33 years old with the beginnings on wrinkles that are starting to stick out when I'm not squinting or smiling. I tried a Neutrogena product first that really did nothing for me. I have combination skin that tends to break out sometimes in the cold weather. I have redness and rough spots as well as furrow lines, smile lines and fine lines by my eyes. I feel that this product hydrates my skin perfectly. If you have oily skin, it may be too much. After a week my wrinkles are appear a bit smoother, my skin is more even and my makeup goes on super smooth. The smell is nice, clean and crisp. This product is not extremely on the high side so I would definitely consider purchasing in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Rich moisturizing goodness!! I've been using the L'Oreal RevitaLift Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for the past 3 days I'd like to tell ya my thoughts on it. First, like the RevitaLift serum, I love the packaging. The jar is a lovely shade of red fits perfectly into the palm of your hand. Now, when you first feel the texture of the cream, although it's smooth, it is rather thick to the touch. Surprisingly, once it's applied to the face, it doesn't feel very heavy at all!! It definitely leaves your face feeling soft smooth. Lastly, the scent is a bit stronger than the serum in the collection but I don't find it to be overwhelming. Overall, I really like this facial lotion will continue using it to see what it can do long term. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Super soft feel. I liked how the RevitalLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer actually made my face feel smooth and my wrinkles less noticeable. The only problem I had was when I added all of the products in the mornings, they left my face oily. I did notice that when I put my makeup on that the wrinkles did not show as much. I was saddened to see that they don't appear to be reducing my wrinkles in the week that I've used them. I wanted to use the product for at least a week before I posted my review, because I wanted to be honest about it. Pros: Made my face feel smooth and soft, showed less under eye wrinkles with make up, and smelled great Cons: Oily skin people need to use sparingly. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Product smeels great. Smells great because it's pleasant to the public and I'm sure others around me would love to use this product and would be very happy with it.
"Great mosturizer I have been using the products L'Oreal Revitalift triple power deep-acting moisturizer, under eyes and lip lines about 3 weeks, and works pretty good repairing wrinkles and smoothing out fine lines. Since the first week I could see my skin hydrated and softer, and now in the third week I have seen a evident reduction in coarse lines. I would prefer a softer perfume in the product , was difficult getting used to it and the texture of the lotion is thicker and heavier than I would like. I stopped using the product in all my face in the second week because was making my skin greasy and I began to apply it only in the lines and that really function for me, and I have very good results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great nighttime moisturizer but has a strong fragrance I normally do not use nighttime moisturizers, but decided to try out the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. It has a thick and creamy consistency but spread on my face easily and did not feel greasy. A little goes a long way so don't use too much! I was not a fan of the fragrance. I personally like creams on my face that have no powerful smell, because it bothers me and keeps me awake since I keep smelling it. I woke up to a fresh-feeling face. The cream did not stain my pillow and by morning I no longer could smell the fragrance. My skin was soft, smooth and hydrated. I am very happy with this moisturizer with the exception of the fragrance. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Softer skin, improved texture I used this product along with the concentrated facial serum. I only had the opportunity to use these products for a couple of weeks, but I have definitely noticed a difference in the softness and texture of my skin. These effects were noticeable within the first few uses and they have improved significantly more with each subsequent use. I do have some fine wrinkles around my eyes that I have yet to see a difference in, but I am hopeful that this product will improve them over time. My one complaint about this product would be the scent. I found the flowery smell to be quite harsh and would prefer a unscented version or one with a more subtle fragrance. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Moisturizing and lovely!!! Love the texture, love the scent, love the tightening sensation!!! This is a winner!"
"Silky and smooth! I especially like the creamy feel of the L'Oreal Triple Power Deep-Acting RevitaLift Facial Moisturizer. It goes on cool and leaves your face with an incredibly silky feel to it, but not greasy. I like using it in the morning because the cool sensation helps to get me motivated for my day! My only complaint about the L'Oreal RevitaLift is that it is a little perfumey after you have it on for a few minutes. I have some dry areas on my face, especially in the winter, and it slightly irritates those areas when I used the lotion at night. Plus, I just prefer softer fragrances for my facial moisturizers. Overall, I love the silky, smooth way that my face feels after using L'Oreal Triple Power Deep-Acting Revitalift Moisturizer for over a week. I will continue to put it on in the mornings when I'm getting ready for work. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
L'oriel Revitalift Concertrated Serum I think that the L'Oriel Revitalift line is fantastic! I have used it for the last several weeks have certainly noticed a difference in my skin. My friends have even asked me what I have been using on my face. First the concentrated serum immediately absorbs into the skin! Not oily feel and I really like the consistency. I use it morning and evening on my face neck. I have certainly noticed smoother skin and less dark spots under my eyes. I have noticed less puffiness especially in the am. After this step I use the triple power cream. This is a little thicker but works nicely to moisturize the skin. In the mornings I use the day lotion. I especially love this because it contains SPF 20 so that eliminates the extra sunscreen step. I feel that this product is great for your skin. It keeps you looking young! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love this moisturizer!!! My new favorite moisturizer! It's the same light floral scent as the other revitalift moisturizers, which I love. The little jar this moisturizer is in is cute, yet sophisticated - I love seeing it on my bathroom shelf! The moisturizer itself is this great thick, creamy texture. You do need to keep rubbing it until thoroughly absorbed - like the jar says. At first, I thought it might be too heavy, but once fully absorbed it is perfect. I especially love it for night time - my skin drinks it right up. I truly believe it has made my skin smoother and more youthful in just a few weeks of use. I do think some people (maybe with super oily skin) might find it too much for daytime wear. I would say my skin is normal to oily, and I don't always reach for this for a daytime moisturizer. But, I use it religiously at night! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer Luv the way it smelled and the way it goes on. Makes my skin feel soft
Loved the thickness and creaminess. I loved the texture of this and the way it made it made my skin feel.
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer Could be for you It's nice that I can grab as little or as much as I want to use. The smell pleasant and not overly powerful. I did not notice my allergies acting up during my use of the product. The serum has a nice smooth texture and, like the serum, did not give me the greasy feeling that some other products tend to do. I would definitely recommend this product but wish it had step by step directions regarding the order in which you should use the products. They are on the box however, for someone who is forgetful keeping the boxes are cumbersome. My skin does feel smoother and has a nice healthy glow , however I did not see an improvement (yet) on the lines in my forehead (which are really the only deep lines I currently have). I am hoping that by the end of the bottles I'll see more of an improvement. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Simply God Like Its a dream come true because it takes all of your wrinkles away also it makes my skin feel fuller and im beautiful
"Skin-Tastic! I want to give the product more time to give a better review. However, I was excited about being able to try out the L'oreal Paris RevitaLift system. Overall I thought that items came in a timely and was well packaged. I was also pleased with the size of the system. I noticed that there were at least two other products mentioned on the packages. I would have loved to have been able to try them in this review to get the full effects of the entire system. I like how my face looks and feels. The system claims to work on all skin types, I am African American so I thought that it would not work. I also, was exited to see what would happen when trying the product because I have combination skin. I was was both pleased and surprised. I will continue to use the system and I am strongly thinking of adding the cleanser and eye cream also. Great buy and worth the money! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Moisture rich I used the facial moisturizer twice a day following the serum treatment. The moisturizer seemed to provide long lasting protection throughout the day until the evening application was applied. This was a huge bonus considering I often reapplied my previous facial moisturizer several times a day. Upon application, the cream was a nice consistency, not too watery, not to thick, it was just right. The odor was pleasant and the product didn't leave my skin feeling oily or greasy. The reason I rated the product at 4 stars is due to a possible reaction to the product. I used this product in conjunction with the facial serum and after 3 days my skin started to become red and blotchy and received a stinging sensation upon application and lingering for about an hour or two. I can't tell which of the two products caused my reaction or if they were both at fault. I do have sensitive skin so it could very well have been both in my case. One thing is for sure, if you need deep moisturizing that lasts...this is your product. I was blessed to try this product for free through BzzAgent in return for leaving an honest review. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good dry skin moisturizer I like this product as a night cream. It's not super heavy but if you put too much it does have a tendency to leave a 'greasy' layer. I used this in conjunction with 2 other RevitaLift moisturizers - the serum (which I use under this) the day cream with spf (which I use during the day) - but the results have been fairly noticeable especially for the 'testing' only being 15 days!!! (I had late shipping). I have normal to dry skin - with some days a bit oily in my T zone - but def leans towards dry. I do not recommend this for oily or acne/breakout prone skin. I also wouldn't use under makeup , as it's a pretty heavy duty cream. But for me it worked. I was overall pretty satisfied. The scent is a bit strong too for those whom prefer their face/skin care products to be scent free - not for y'all. After using this with the serum and day cream I have noticed more evening or skin tone - 'brightening' if you will , and some of the fine lines on my forehead seem to be a bit softer. I'm sure with continued use the results will keep on getting better. Thx BzzAgent and Loreal !!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Moisturizing Success I am new to using moisturizer, but I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer in combination with the facial serum and day lotion and am pleased overall with the results so far. I am currently on maternity leave with a 4 month old and a 4 year old so I don't have a lot of time for pampering myself, but using this product in the morning and before bed felt like a treat. I like the light, refreshing scent. The product feels great going on and a little goes a long way. My skin was hydrated and glowing. I would prefer the product to be a little less greasy though because I have had 2 breakouts from it and I am not prone to pimples. I'm hoping that continued use will help with fine lines, but I haven't used it long enough to see those results yet. Overall, my skin feels hydrated using this product and I feel like I am taking care of my skin more than I have before. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love this product Love the Revitalift products
Does the job! I tried this moisturizer and was pleased. It did moisturize my skin well. I live in a cold northern climate and am affected greatly during the long winters. I have been using this after my morning shower and it maintains wonderfully throughout the day. I can't say that I have noticed any change in firmness.
"Loving this Moisturizer !!! I love this moisturizer! L'oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer has made my skin soft and brighter. The moisturizer gave my face a natural beautiful glow. My co-workers were asking me if I was pregnant because my skin was so bright. They said I had the glow. I told them, no way I just got a new moisturizer, lol. I was looking for a a daily skin regimen. After noticing such great results from using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Action Facial Moisturizer along with the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment along with L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power I have found my new regimen! The products are not caky, gritty or sticky. They are nice and smooth, easy to apply. The only down side to these products for me would be the weight. The containers are a little heavy to throw in your bag for a quick overnight. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Facial moisturizer Works great as a night moisturizer. Too heavy to use during the day. Even just using this at night my skin feels so much softer. One big con is how strong the perfume smell is. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Loreal revitalift So I tried the moisturizer and when I first used it I thought it leave a greasy or oily feeling. But after it was absorbed it didn't. It left my face soft and lasted all day. It has a nice scent and it doesn't make your face feel greasy if you sweat which is great. I will absolutely recommended this to others and will be using in the future. 4 stars. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer This is a somewhat thick, moisturizing cream. It is very emollient and leaves you skin feeling extremely hydrated. I think this would be absolutely great for dry skin. I have normal/combo skin (oily in t-zone) and this just has too much moisture for my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Very nice with the skin This product is nice with the skin because it smoothes it and my your skin look healthy
"Creamy Moisturizer The moisturizer is very thick and creamy. It feels great at night, but I think it is a little too much for during the day. I adjusted the amount I used and tried a couple more days, but it's still too heavy for daytime I believe. My skin is very soft now though and I would definitely use this product again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Nice Affordable Facial Moisturizer The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is a good moisturizer for it's price range. It goes on smooth and smells nice. It does not leave a greasy or oily residue on your skin. It absorbs quickly and well. It will keep your face moisturized for hours. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Worth a try I have never used this brand of moisturizer before and I do like it. It goes on smooth and does not feel thick like some other brands. My skin feels softer and smoother. It does have a scent, but I don't think it is too strong of a smell like some other brands. I may consider purchasing more when I run out. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Solid Moisturizer Especially when layered over the serum, this provides a nice level of moisturization without feeling too heavy. I appreciate that it contains hyaluronic acid, as I know that that has been proven to improve skin condition. I'm not crazy about the perfumey fragrance, but that's not a deal-breaker for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
really nice This is a really nice moisturizer. Its not at all greasy and has a really light fragrance to it. I am particularly pleased that this product doesnt make my face oily or shiny throughout the course of the day. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Moisturize mousturize mousturize! I really like this product! Not only am I working on fixing my wrinkles by using this product I also get a moisturizer that actually works on my face! It is incredibly dry where I am from. I am very pleased with this product. The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because of the scent. For someone who is sensitive to scents it is a little strong. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Rich, creamy face lotion I really enjoy this facial lotion. The lid is a little slippery and hard to open if your hands are wet or have serum on them from your 1st product. This product smells nice and clean and is a thick, creamy lotion. It spreads nice and smooth. After applying it to my face, it looks dewy and soft. I enjoy the way it feels on my face and how easy it goes on. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Another Step I am lucky to get my face washed everyday so a second step is a little annoying. When I opened the jar, it seems that the product isn't filled all the way to the top which forces me to use less than I think I should. It DOES leave my skin really soft which is excellent and it makes my skin look healthier. This product is really good, I just hate the time it takes. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"deep acting facial moisturizer This moisturizer was easy to use, went on easily, but didn't seem to absorb very well. My skin felt too wet. I have been trying to use less and that helps. So maybe I used too much at first. I do notice that if I use it in the morning, if I get over heated or the weather is too warm it runs into my eyes. So I haven't been using it in the morning, just at bed time. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Feels great! This moisturizer is a good one. I applied the Concentrated Serum first then the Moisturizer over that morning and night. I didn't have long to review it so I can't really report on it's long-term usage. Short-term usage provided a very soft, supple feel to my skin, and even started working on smaller lines and crepiness around my eyes. I'd recommend it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Amazing This product is amazing and I recommend this to all of my friends
Moisturizer Trial I have been using this as a daily moisturizer after washing my face. It has a great scent and goes on smooth without feeling oily. I really like the product so far... but would like to see how my skin responds to it over time. It has not caused any breakouts and I have sensitive skin. I would like to see if it helps smooth eye wrinkles. So far good though! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"I like it so far... I have been using the product for a little over a week and so far I like what I am seeing. While I haven't noticed any reduction in wrinkles, I do like how soft my skin feels since beginning to use the product. My skin also looks and feels healthier, less red. I do find that the moisturizer feels a little bit heavy, but so far, so good. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great moisturizer without the oily residue! So I have been using this moisturizer for a lil over a week. The scent is nice. The texture is light, but covers well without being watery or too thick. I have combination skin, so I was a little worried I might have a few breakouts, but so far so good. I have noticed a healthier glow to my face, and I'm sure you will too! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Big difference This product has really kept my skin moisturized all day long. A lot of other moisturizers only work part of the day and then my skin usually feels dry again by the middle of the day. With this one....my skin looks moisturized, hydrated and it's really soft. It has a nice pleasant smell. I only wish that it was in a pump form. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Moisturized! This moisturizer along with the serum works great! It leaves your skin feeling fresh and smooth and hydrated throughout the day! I have only been using it for about a week so I'm not sure if it's working for wrinkles and tightening yet but my face looks younger and I'll definitely recommend this product and buy it myself in the future!

"Rich night-time moisturizer I've been using L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer every night for the last two weeks. At first I was using it along with the Revitalift serum, but I found that this combination was just too rich for my face and I was waking up with an oily complexion, so I switched to using the moisturizer on its own and have had much better results. What this does tell me is that this might be a perfect match for those who struggle with extremely dry skin! I have noticed some difference in my complexion over the two weeks - most noticeably that my previously dry skin is now well moisturized - even over moisturized. I love the scent of this product - it is light and fresh. The packaging is beautiful and luxe, however it is simply a jar, not a pump, so if you are concerned about bacteria you may want to use a spatula or spoon with this product. I removed 1 star for this. A little goes a long way and with once a day use I anticipate this 1.7 oz jar lasting me 3-4 months - a great value for the price! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Very Hydrating but Smells too Strong As with the serum the first thing I noticed when I tried the product was the extremely pungent perfume fragrance. Again, had I not received this product as part of a Bzz Campaign I would have returned it without trying it because the smell was so strong and unpleasant, but I'm glad I did. This product is extremely hydrating! I feel like my face was moisturized all day! That fast fading dry feeling is my main complaint with other products and I was very pleased to not have to reapply moisturizers continuously all day to feel like I'm not drying out. I am definitely making L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer a normal part of my daily beauty regimine. As for the anti-agin effects, I haven't seen a dramatic change in my facial appearance, I have only been using it for 2 weeks so I will continue to try it and see what happens. But I would definitely recommend the products to others, just be prepared for the smell. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer from L'Oreal First off, I'm loving how professional and up-scale the container for this moisturizer looks on my white quarts bathroom countertops! The dark red really stands out, and its one of the few things I'm OK with leaving out as opposed to hiding in a drawer of cabinet! Though the look of the container is nice, a twist off top for moisturizer isn't ideal to me - I use this in the mornings when getting ready for work, so I want to be able to quickly pump some product onto my fingers without having to worry about re-twisting back on a top or getting the container covered in product. So that's one disappointment I have about the moisturizer. I'm also disappointed with the quantity in the container - for something that should be used daily, I'd expect more so that it would last longer. I've been using the L'Oreal Paris Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for a few days now, mostly in the mornings after showering and washing my face. The texture is thick and feels soothing on my skin, though it does feel a little heavy if I accidentally use to much. I've learned that a little goes a long way, so be aware of this! My favorite aspect of this moisturizer is how long it lasts. I'm experimenting with using less foundation and BB cream and have found that even without these, if I use this moisturizer, in the afternoons my face still feels soft and protected (I find that I'm actually washing this product off my face in the evenings - it didn't necessarily rub off throughout the day). I have not noticed any particular change in how my skin looks (wrinkle lift, firming, etc.), except for the fact that my face looks noticeably moisturized and healthy (which is great, since that is clearly stated on the box as an outcome after one week of use and I've only been using this for maybe 5 days). Like many products, this is one that will take about 4 weeks to notice any difference in skin appearance, so don't be alarmed if you don't have any results right away. Overall, I'm happy with the texture and smoothness of the moisturizer and would definitely suggest it over the standard daily moisturizers - those then to dry up within a few hours. I'd gladly put this on every day and have a glowing smooth look, rather than covering up with foundation and BB creams! I just happen to prefer using this in the mornings rather than the evenings, so the twist off container is annoying to me when I'm trying to quickly get ready in the morning, but if you use it in the evenings or aren't in a hurry, then maybe it won't be a big deal to you.

"A little heavy, but effective I've been using the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer primarily as part of my nighttime routine. I found it a little too heavy to wear during the day in addition to the serum and spf day moisturizer. It's very thick, but doesn't go on greasy. It absorbs well into the skin, and does leave my skin feeling soft. I had some trial and error time figuring out that more than once a day for this moisturizer was too much for me. Additionally, if I attempt to put make up over it, it feels a little like the two mix together and crumble off my skin. Used at night before bed though, I wake up with my skin feeling soft. I think it's a good option for a nighttime moisture surge. As with the other two products, my big complaint is with the scent, which reminds me of a cheap hotel shampoo or bar of soap. Not a smell I revel in. Thankfully application time is the only time I smell it, but I would certainly prefer something a little more feminine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Keep your skin young looking with L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I mistakenly previously reviewed this product and was thinking it was the serum...so this is correct review. Sorry. When I first tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, I would apply it after using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment as a second step.I also used it twice a day, in the morning and again in the evening. It is easy to use and it is a cream. I liked the idea that it was helping my skin and contains Pro-Xylane which stimulates collagen production. I would apply it to my face and also my neck. But it leaves a coated feeling which I did not like. It doesn't seem to be absorbed into the skin completely like the serum. So now I just apply it in the evening only. Still love that it is working on my skin. I find it my job to keep my skin young looking and this makes my job so much easier...I would recommend it, but only for night time use.

"Night Time Luxury Though this cream isn't marketed for night-time use, I found that the evening is the best time for me to apply it. Because it is thick and rich, it is too heavy for day use on my combination skin. At night, though, it feels like a wonderful treat and leaves my skin looking and feeling soft and smooth in the morning. I'm so pleased with the entire L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift line! For a girl in her mid-thirties, I'm looking to keep my skin gorgeous for a long time and I know that work starts now. This protective, regenerative moisturizer is a great tool in that battle against wrinkles and spots!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I'm on the fence I loved the serum but the triple power deep acting facial moisturizer sorta let me down. I don't like that it's in a tub so you have to dip your fingers in. I prefer a pump. It's also quite thick, which I normally also don't care for but it really hydrated my skin. It has a really light scent which I found quite pleasant. I also used this on my hands after applying and my hands were very soft. I would certainly buy this product again if it wasn't in a tub. My review is my own honest opinion but I received this product complimentary from BzzAgent for my honest review. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
My Review thus far The product is very smooth and feels nice on the skin about 4 days in I had to stop because my allergies were getting the better of me my eyes felt dry I could have used the under eye bag cream but I did not have that I do not feel it is the cream I choose to stop use for a few days give my eyes rest and try again I will post more later if it will let me in all fairness I was ill that week and it started as seasonal allergies with sinus headache and my decongestant was the type that dries things up which causes my eyes to be more reactive. Photos to be posted later. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Good Product! This is a nice cream that diminishes fine lines due to aging on your facial skin. I like the results that I see in a short time as well as the consistency and aroma of the actual cream, so this turned out well in my case. I hope others will have the same results."
"My First Time Using a Serum I had never used a serum product before, so I had no expectations going in. Either that or I expected magic and miracles... Now I'm not sure. I used the product for three weeks. The first thing I noticed was that for a week, I couldn't wear it under make up because my face would peel. It stopped after a week and I learned to use less product. My most noticeable result was on my freckles. It lightened them! Like for real!! How rad is that!!

A new staple in my facial care I think I've 5 found a new staple in my facial care. The combo of all three products is awesome. The moisturizer leaves your skin feeling baby soft. There's no unpleasant smell or over powering odor. The cream goes on smoothly and spreads well. I can tell the difference when I don't use it. I have no more dry dpots on my face. If you're looking for something to rejuvenate your skin this is it. Definitely a new staple in my skin care. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Made my face feel soft So far I really like this moisturizer. I use it at night before bed because I heard that's when it's best to use face products. I used it in combination with the serum. I will try using it Day and night for better results. Overall, very happy with product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Hydration I was apprehensive to try the entire Revitalift line because I do have somewhat sensitive skin, but also because I'm very prone to clogged pores and blackheads. Once I find a routine that works for me, I tend to stick with it for a long time, and only experiment with one or two different items at a time. About my skin: I have combo skin that leans towards oily. However, because I use a prescription retinol lotion each night, my skin does get dry. And sometimes, it gets really dehydrated so I have flaking skin on my nose which is also oily - it's not cute. First application I noticed that there was a strong smell. I happen to really like the scent, it reminds me of a L'Oreal hair conditioner that I used to use. I will say that the scent lasted on my skin for quite some time, so if you're highly sensitive to fragrance or you just prefer unscented skin care products, this might not be for you. The moisturizer smooths over the skin and feels really pleasant when applied. I did note that this was a bit heavy for me, but that's most likely because I do have some issues with oil. I used it for some time at night, and once under makeup when my skin was being particularly troublesome, and I did wake up with smoother and softer skin that felt really hydrated. However, it did clog my pores up. I definitely didn't have an issue with breakouts and it wasn't huge, but I did notice some extra clogged pores and a slight increase in blackheads while using this product. Overall, this is a great night moisturizer, especially with winter weather coming. I will definitely continue to use on my neck and chest, and I'll use it on my face when it's extra dry. I also used this as an intensive hand treatment and I LOVED it for that. I think this would be best geared toward drier skin types, because it is a bit heavy for oily skin.

"Liked more than the other two I enjoyed this product the most of the set. Scent and texture were good and left face feeling fresh. As for results, I have yet to see..... But will continue using. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Triple power Ok, so to start off I normally have extremely sensitive skin and I was able to use this product without any irritation what so ever that in my opinion is amazing and worth 4 or more stars! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Amazing This product makes me feel so refreshed ... after using it for a few weeks I feel my skin is tighter and youth looking
Moisturizers like none other! I think this product is great!! I use this in the evening before bed. It feels like it might go on heavy but it absorbs quickly and feels light in minutes. My face feels moisturized and healthy. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Deeply Moisturizing Is Right! At 30 years old, I'm trying to care for my skin well but the combination of oily and dry makes it a bit of a challenge. L'Oreal Paris' RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is truly deep acting and moisturizing. It goes on smoothly without being too heavy, goopy, or sticky. After use, my winter-worn skin was tighter, smoother, and brighter- it just seemed happier and clearly better cared for. Because of my combination skin, I realized daily use was too much for me so I cut down to a couple times a week all over and daily use just on drier parts of my skin. I recommend this to everyone for occasional use, but definitely for those who have drier skin and need the deep moisturizing. I even use it on my hands! After a day of baking and frequent hand washing and outdoor work in cold weather, my hands were chapped, dry, and worn, I used the facial moisturizer on them before bed and, in addition to instantly feeling better, they were soft and rejuvenated in the morning.

"My RevitalLift Experience Before I get a product I would want to know what it specifically does, what other user's reactions where to it, and if the company that produces it is known to deliver what is promised. Overall i'd say that had a good experience with L'Oreal RevitalLift. I tried the concentrated facial serum, the deep acting facial moisturizer and the facial day lotion SPF 20. I've been using them for about a week now and I really like the affect they've had on my skin. I had been looking for a product to soften my skin and make it look smoother and healthier and RevitaLift did just that. My face is very soft to the touch now and the products have a great fragrance to them. The only thing I didn't like is that my face is a little shiny. I'd be very interested to know what products are offered for people with oily skin. I have noticed this product before while shopping, but I thought it was a little too expensive. Now that i've had a chance to try it, i'll definitely consider purchasing it in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Very Moisturizing I was a little worried when I first tried this moisturizer because its a little heavier than I'd normally choose. So I decided to use it as my night cream and I was a fan after my first night! The cream is super rich, a little goes a long way and yet it feels very light on my skin. I don't feel like I'm wearing a heavy cream. It makes my skin so soft and after a few days I could already see results. I have smoother and more hydrated skin. I've noticed my fine lines are already disappearing and I look younger. I get very dry skin, living in MN but using this cream I'm not have my usual flakiness and dullness. It absorbs very quickly and goes a long way. I use it on my face, neck and decolletage and I can see my skin already looks firmer and more vibrant! I also like the fresh, clean scent. I'm excited to see how this moisturizer works over the harsh MN winter! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Satisfied This cream has a nice scent, it lasts awhile and it seemed to lessen the appearance of the fine lines around my eyes. It is very thick so I only used it at night."
"Very Moisturizing I've changed my skin care routine to the L'Oreal RivitaLift Triple Power line. I've been using it for a little over a week now. I use the Facial Serum morning and night, the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer at night and the Facial Day Lotion in the morning. I haven't noticed a difference with my wrinkles but my skin feels softer and smoother. I tried using the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer in the morning but I noticed my foundation wouldn't set over it. I switched to using the Day Lotion in the morning and now I don't have that problem. If I don't let the lotion soak in for a few minutes and use a primer before using foundation I do get some streaking. This line is very hydrating. I like the smell. It is a little strong but it dissipates quickly. It might be a little much for people sensitive to fragrance. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Rich and creamy. Luxury in a red bottle I am loving this L'Oral line. I am reviewing the deep acting facial moisturizer, and can say without a doubt it has left my skin feeling fresh. There is no greasy residue and it soaks into the skin rather quickly. There is no pungent scent. Instead it has a soft, average, aroma one normally expects from moisturizers. I use this as the third step in my L'Oral skin care line, and absolutely love it. A perfect finishing product for well hydrated skin. The lotion comes in a pot, and is rich and creamy. Very easy to apply, only a small amount of product is needed. I have raved to my mother about this long enough, she's now buying her own set! Thank you for sharing such a wonderful product! Bonus pic, showing what one swipe of moisturizer looks like. You can see how creamy it is! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"High quality moisturizer! I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review on a product review website and I love it so much that I wanted to make sure my review was posted here too. gotitfree This moisturizer smells great and comes in a very sleek looking red glass jar. A little bit goes a long way. I have been using the product for almost 3 months and I am still on my first jar! I use it in combination with the Revitalift Concentrated Serum at night (I use the concentrated serum with the Revitalift Triple Power Day Lotion during the day). My face looks and feels great! The only downside I have experienced is that the moisturizer feels thick when I first put it on, which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I just make sure I use it 10-15 minutes before I lay down on my pillow at night. Great, quality product that is priced well since it lasts for so long!

"Beautifully smooth L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer was so smooth and silky to put on it almost felt like I wasn't using enough because I couldn't feel it rub into the skin like most moisturizers. It was very silky smooth , not greasy or oily, very soft and luxurious on the skin. I did feel my skin feeling more thick by the end of one week using this product. Although with a hormonal acne problem that's not the greatest because it seems blemishes are deeper under the skin. The age defying element was noticeable temporarily, but seemed to wear off by days end or by morning. Seemed to plump skin and smooth out fine lines and wrinkles This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Awesome product i tend to get really dry patches in areas of my face that can look quite dull even when i moisturized....until I started using the L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple ower Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer...now my skin just glows to the point where even my BF mentions it. The biggest plus of this, apart from younger looking skin is that it contains an spf that doesn't feel heavy! love it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Olay regenerist It feels great on your skin.
"No more dry skin I think L'Oreal revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer is great. Before i started using it my face was extremely dry. After the second day of using it I had no more dry spots. You couldnt tell my skin was very dry days before. It is very easy to apply makeup over it. The only little bad thing is my nose gets a little oily through the day, but that doesnt stop me from using this great product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice product! I've used this a few times so far and really do like it. It has a light floral scent that's not overpowering, goes on smooth and fairly light. It felt good on my face though it did feel a bit sticky on my hands after so I did need to rinse them for comfort. But on my face it didn't feel that way. I've not noticed a change in my skin yet but it does feel good. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love the way this smells!!! I used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and i absolutely love the was this moisturizer smells. The scent isn't too strong but leaves your face with a great scent. I used this every morning after washing my face and my face looks smoother and feels softer. I did find it to be a bit greasy but i wil still continue to use this product. I really liked it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Really Impressed I received his as a free sample! I am really impressed that I got a full-size sample! I have been using this for over a week now every night before bed I'm impressed at how moisturize my skin is in the morning. My skin is smoother brighter. I think that some people would put off by the scent. Though it smells good some don't like a strong scent. I am really happy to have this in my routine!

"On the fence I was given this product to try at no cost by influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. After trying it for 14 days I've decided it needs more time to see actual results. What I've seen so far is super moisturized skin (live in a hit desert), bigger blackheads on my nose (the only place I usually get them), and an occasional larger than normal acne spot. I'm wondering if some of the molecules in this cream are too big and plug up my pores. I only put it on at night after my shower because some users were saying it was too thick to use before applying makeup. Overall I like how it moisturizes, but will hold off on giving a full opinion for another 45 days. Influenster, OlayAtWalmart and contest"
"Baby Soft! I've been using this product for 3 weeks now and my face feels the softest it's felt in a long time. I use this product in the morning, under my makeup, and in the evening. You only need to use a pea size amount as it goes a long way. My skin has always been on the dry side and I can definitely feel the difference and the moisture. I would definitely try this product and will recommend it to my friends."
"Love My RevitaLift! I have been using the RevitaLift products for a few weeks now and I love the serum and deep-acting facial moisturizer combo the most! I have already started to see my fine lines around my eyes start to fade! The serum soaks in and I let it set for a few minutes before I use the deep acting facial moisturizer which is part of my bedtime routine. It smells great without being overwhelming and irritating to my skin. 3 weeks of using the products and my skin is softer, smoother, and has regained that natural glow. The only thing I have found so far that I would want to be different is the price. The RevitaLift products are more of a system and for it to be the most effective they are used in combination and it can get pricey if you purchase them all. I wish the prices would be a little less for each product or L'Oreal could offer a combo pack at a better price. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Softer Skin After using L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for one week, my skin is feeling the effects. My skin is softer, and small dry patches have disappeared. The moisturizer smells good, and feels nice going on. It is not heavy, or watery, just right. I will definitely continue to use this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Oily T-Zone Balancing Act Beginning from the beginning, the packaging is beautiful to me. A bit reminiscent of some Olay or Avon products, but no matter, it looks quite prestige. The jar you get with this product is indeed not full to the brim but you only need a dollop on the tip of your finger, dotted about the face and massaged in to apply. The first scent I got was of a fresh floral arranged study or a window box. It was lovely, however, once mixed with skins natural oils, it became a bit too sweet and soapy smelling. This disappates after an hour or so. Applying this in the morning after my face washing routine, I did not need to blot until around happy hour. It, in concert with other products in this line, balanced my oily t-zone (a near miracle). As with any product I test, I like to try to take as much of the time allotted to give the product a REAL go. I get to see how it reacts during mentrual cycles, during different weather, stress, and long days or nights. This product held up like a poised socialite and didn't break a sweat haha. You will enjoy this moisturizer, it isn't too thick, especially now as it gets cooler outside, and leaves your face feeling...cared for. This one is a go buy. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great Product. Noticed a difference the very next day. Smells great very mild. Feels great on your skin.
Love this great skin care product My skin was so dry and damaged from the sun. Using this for 2 months I saw great results. I will never stop using this product it's been 5 months and still satisfied

Great Product Leaves my skin smooth without feeling oily. You can never start too early to prevent fine lines and wrinkles.
Very Good Moisturizer I really liked the thick texture of Revitalift. It was a very good moisturizer. During the winter I often get dry patches on my skin and this product really helped with that. I got to try a one week sample so I cannot say if the anti aging aspect of this product is true or not. I did notice a positive change in the texture of my skin and I will definitely use this product again.
"Youthful Appearance I loved this product. After the first use I could feel the the affect it had on my skin. Out of all the products I have used, I would say this is the best."
"Like This Moisturizer i like everything about this moisturizer...the feel, the smell, the texture, but I would like at least a 15 spf included so that I could wear it outdoors! It's perfect for cool days and nights indoors."
Revitalift® Triple Power™ Deep-acting Moistuirizer made my face feel so soft and made me look younger
Love This! I loved the way it made my face feel as soon as I put it on. I could already tell a difference on my dry cheeks.
Great Job On The Face I wanted to keep my face looking young
"Blended In So Well! When I appled the RevitaLift Triple Power sample I received in the mail I was impressed on how well it blended into my skin. It was like it was never there, no heavy, filmy feel afterwards. Left my skin feeling refreshed!"
"Great Moisturizer I think this is a great moisturizer. It went on smoothly and evenly. Made my face feel immediately soft and smooth and not a bit greasy. My face did not seem to get that shine throughout the day which is a good thing. I can see the benefits with continued use of this product. I imagine that wrinkles would diminish, my crows feet would become tiny lines. The skin was actually softer with this limited use, I believe it would become eventoned and healthier."
"olay products Effectiveness,price all worth for this product, I really like this for my aging dull skin,at my age it's hard to find a product that helps my skin get hydrated. My family saw a difference in my skin after use, I got lots of compliments about my skin on my face. You don't need to spend a lot of hard work to just apply, it works while I sleep and under make up. I felt price is reasonable and works great! I have tried more expensive cream for my face and was DISAPOINTED, untill I tried the Olay products I really love them. I also know they work!! I would recommend this products to all skin types, they have several products for every type of skin. Thank You So Very Much. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Revitallift Triple Power 5 Days just wasn't long enough to give a through review, I did find that the product seemed to work great , smelled nice , no greasy mess left on my face, hopefully my small lines and wrinkles will fade away with continued use."
So Soft I loved how soft this made my skin. My face didn't look as tired as it usually does. Loved the smell too.
Love This Moisturizer! I really wanted to start using anti aging products and when I received the sample in the mail I was very impressed. As soon as I applied the product on I started noticing a difference around my jaw and neck area. The area seemed firmer and smoother. I have been using this product daily and I am very happy with it. I use it right after I wash my face and also apply it on my neck area. The packaging is very pretty and I love the color!! It is a great product and I definitely recommend it!
Love The Smooth Feel! I have dry skin on my face and it is especially noticeable in the winter months. I have used the moisturizer twice so far and was very pleased with the way my face looked. It not only made my face feel smooth
"Supple N Smooth I got samples in the mail and as long as it lasted I really liked the cream. Smooth, thick but not greasy. My face felt nice"
"Great Moisturizer Ive used this for almost a week , havent noticed much in wrinkle reduction yet, but it feels great on and has a nice smell."
I Really Liked This Moisturizer. I liked this moisturizer. I thought it absorbed quickly and didn't leave a film on my skin. It also smelled nice and I would recommend it to other women.
Works Great it really works great. absorbs into skin well. can't wait to try eye treatment
Only Used For A Week I am only one week into this regime and I believe I am seeing a difference in elasticity and fewer fine wrinkles.
"Moisture That Absorbs Quickly I love how my skin drinks this in. I wish it was fragrance free, however. I would have given it 5 stars if it had less of a scent. I would buy it again."
"Amazing Fragrance I have tried many different types of moisturizers, but this product does a great job for me! Thanks Regeneration Oil of Olay"
Nice Cream the first applications felt good after it was felt that only on the surface
Great Product I loved it. I would definately buy and use this product over saw improvements within first 3 days.
Does The Job! I tried this moisturizer and was pleased. It did moisturize my skin well. I live in a cold northern climate and am affected greatly during the long winters. I have been using this after my morning shower and it maintains wonderfully throughout the day. I can't say that I have noticed any change in firmness.
"Great Moisturizer! I am really enjoying this moisturizer. I have fairly dry skin, especially during the winter months. This blended right into my skin nicely. It feels to me like a thicker consistancy. Some moiturizers are so light or thin that it feels like you need to re-apply it more than once to do the job."
What A Difference This product made my face look and feel like a I was still in my 20's.
Great Stuff!!! I love it!!! It dosen't leave my skin really shiny after I apply it.
Love It! I saw a noticable difference in my skin within a week!
Noticible Difference In Fine Lines And Wrinkles. This product definatly helped with fine lines and wrinkles. Would be my favorite if it also helped with dark spots.
Moisture Miracle This product worked great! I have extremely dry skin and this product made all the flakes and fine lines disappear. I have been looking for a good moistureizer and with Rivitalift I found one that makes my skin appear soft and younger.
"Deep Acting Moisturizer So far so good. I've been using this for a few days now and it seems to be a keeper. Not sure that it is getting rid of lines, but my skin seems a little smoother."
"Great for sensitive skin I'm very pale and have somewhat irritable skin, so I am pleased that this moisturizer is so light and easy on my face. Great hydration. It's a bit thicker than some products, so it will take longer to absorb fully. The package technology is actually really cool. You push the whole top of the jar down, and a little bit of the cream comes up. It works something like a push-pop. You get just the right amount, and when you get to the last of it, all of the cream is pushed out so that there isn't any wasted being stuck inside the jar. Love that."
"Softest Skin! I have been using this product for about a week and a half and have already noticed a difference. Other products have burned or irritated my skin, but this one does not. When I wake my skin still feels soft and smooth, my pores seem smaller and my makeup goes on smoother. The only complaint would be the scent, it smells good, but a little too strong for the face area."
"It Works I love Loreal products and use them all the time. This cream had a different smell to it, but went away quickly. I really liked the feel of it after applying it to my face and neck."
Nice Moisturizer I enjoyed the smell
What Wrinkles?! Thanks for the samples. I loved how it made my skin feel and the fragrance was wonderful. I would certainly buy this product.
"I'll Be Making The Switch I was using another well known brand of moisurizer,but I will be switching! I love the way Revitalift makes my skin feel and look,with such little effort. I use it all over my face,even on and around the eyes.My former routine was 3 different products just for moisturizing. Revitalift is now my day and night moisturizer.In just a few days I saw wrinkles diminishing,my skin grew firmer and softer. It is not heavy,and soaks into my skin,leaving a younger,fresher,smoother feel. Nice scent"
Very Moisturizing I was hoping for a tightening in the jaw line but did not see that but I only used this product for 5 days. I did see a difference in the moisure in my face and the softness. I feel the 5 days may not be enough time to judge fairly as far as wrinkle improvement.
"So Far, So Good Have just finished trying a sample of this product and I am pleased with it. It seems to hydrate nicely and I intend to buy a full size and see how using it long term affects my skin, at which point I may increase the number of stars I award to it."
"""Skin Feels Great!!"" I was fortunate enough to obtain a weeks worth of samples of the RevitaLift. My skin absorbed it easily, and my skin, after a week was noticeably softer and more even toned."
Trying To Look More Youthful! I received my samples in the mail and since using them have noticed an improvement in my skin.Such a wonderful scent and makes my face feel so good.
"Great Moisture All Day I received samples and tried them for the last week. Living in upstate New York in the winter moisturizer is a necessary staple. Loreal is not heavy, stickey or gummy like most. I can put this on in the morning and have soft, delicate skin all day. I have found my forever moisturizer . I should have known another Loreal product I have fallen in love with."
GOOD PRODUCT! THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT. MY SKIN IS DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED! IT LIVES UP TO ITS PROMISES. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS I WISH IT HAD SPF ALREADY ADDED . i HAVE TO USE A SEPERATE PRODUCT WITH SUNBLOCK IN IT AS WELL. FOR THE PRICES OF THESE PRODUCTS AND THE WHOLE REGIMEN FOR THAT MATTER THERE SHOULD BE SOME SUNBLOCK ADDED . DONT GET ME WRONG THESE PRODUCTS ARE AWESOME!
"Works Okay I received this as a sample and I must say I love getting samples. However, this is no better than any other high end moisturizer I have tried. I didn't see any lifting qualities."
This Is Great! Love this product!
Good Stuff! I really like the texture of the product and the fact that is goes on smoothly without feeling slimy or greasy.
I Really Works I purchased the RevivaLivt Triple Power a week ago. I can already see softening of wrinkles and more firmness around my jaw line. I will use it to the bottom of the jaw. I love the way it feels on my skin.
"Creamy, Smooth And Refreshing I simply love this moisturizer for night time use. I put it on after washing my face at the end of each day. The moisturizer goes on cream and smooth without a heavy, greasy feeling. It is absorbed quickly so you don't feel like it's being rubbed of onto your pillows at night. I didn't use it during the day because I use L'Oreal's Facial Day Lotion, but it can definitely be used because it is not heavy. I highly recommend this if you are looking for a light moisturizer that works. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Moisturizer Without The Oily Residue! So I have been using this moisturizer for a lil over a week. The scent is nice. The texture is light, but covers well without being watery or too thick. I have combination skin, so I was a little worried I might have a few breakouts, but so far so good. I have noticed a healthier glow to my face, and I'm sure you will too! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Day Cream With Spf I like the pump bottle that the lotion came in. I also was very pleased with the spf! I felt this had the right amount of coverage, and my face did not get greasy through the day. After 1 week of use my face is much smoother and looks healthy. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Seems Good So Far I like the feel of this moisturizer. Not oily or greasy, absorbs into the skin readily. Light fragrance. Can't really tell any difference in appearance of my 70 year old skin, but I do like the way it leaves my skin feeling. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Super Moisturizing And Pretty Packaging I have been using this moisturizer once a day, at night, before I go to bed. First, I use the Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment and then I layer a dollop (about a pea-sized amount) of this moisturizer all over my face, concentrating around my eyes, where the skin is thinnest. If you have oily skin, you should probably skip the moisturizer or just put it under your eyes and around any dry areas. I put this over my entire face every day. For the cons, I would have preferred a pump dispenser. It seems a little messy to dip your finger into the jar, and I was never sure how much to use, exactly. It has a lightweight, floral scent that is pleasant and it absorbs quickly into the skin. I never got any breakouts, but then again, I'm in my 30s. The jar was very pretty on my counter. The colors of slate gray, red, and gold go together beautifully. The glass jar had some weight to it and felt expensive - no thin, plastic container here! I will continue to use this moisturizer every day, especially under my eyes. It is very thick and creamy, yet absorbs fast. So important to keep your under eye area hydrated to prevent those fine lines! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer If I could describe this moisturizer in just one word it would be: luxurious. Immediately my dry skin was no longer flaky! After just one use! Not only did it help hydrate my skin and give it a nice smooth and soft texture, it smells great while doing it. The only thing I didn't like was it would sometimes get clump-like... Feeling the product ball up on my face. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
It is the best. I have tried many other products but Oil of Olay is the best. It is not oily or a heavy lotion my skin looks feels good.
"Beautifully Smooth L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer was so smooth and silky to put on it almost felt like I wasn't using enough because I couldn't feel it rub into the skin like most moisturizers. It was very silky smooth , not greasy or oily, very soft and luxurious on the skin. I did feel my skin feeling more thick by the end of one week using this product. Although with a hormonal acne problem that's not the greatest because it seems blemishes are deeper under the skin. The age defying element was noticeable temporarily, but seemed to wear off by days end or by morning. Seemed to plump skin and smooth out fine lines and wrinkles This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love The Moisturizer After trying the moisturize for a few days...I'm loving how it keeps my skin moisturized. I generally have combination dry skin but this really kept the dryness at bay. The consistency is just right. It's not runny or to solid. It applies to the skin perfectly. I would consider switching moisturizers for this one. It's very light on the skin.

"Moisture Rich I used the facial moisturizer twice a day following the serum treatment. The moisturizer seemed to provide long lasting protection throughout the day until the evening application was applied. This was a huge bonus considering I often reapplied my previous facial moisturizer several times a day. Upon application, the cream was a nice consistency, not too watery, not to thick, it was just right. The odor was pleasant and the product didn't leave my skin feeling oily or greasy. The reason I rated the product at 4 stars is due to a possible reaction to the product. I used this product in conjunction with the facial serum and after 3 days my skin started to become red and blotchy and received a stinging sensation upon application and lingering for about an hour or two. I can't tell which of the two products caused my reaction or if they were both at fault. I do have sensitive skin so it could very well have been both in my case. One thing is for sure, if you need deep moisturizing that lasts...this is your product. I was blessed to try this product for free through BzzAgent in return for leaving an honest review.

"This Stuff Works! I've been using this product for a little over a week now and for I'm loving it! After two days of use I noticed how soft and smooth my skin felt. I had some dry patches and they just disappeared. But was replaced with oily skin :( I think fixed it though. I believe I was using too much, I've cut back on the amount and so far it seems to have gotten better. I don't think I have younger looking skin, but it hasn't been the full 4 weeks, there's still time. The scent is pleasant, not over powering at all! Excited to continue using this in hopes that it will work as advertised! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Very Good Moisturizer L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer leaves my skin feeling fresh and smooth for the whole day! This is a great base for makeup. I just use compact powder on the moisturizer and I see no shine or greasiness for a minimum of 7 hours. My skin feels fresh and no breakouts yet which I am very happy about. I have been using it only for about a week now so I'm not sure if it's working for wrinkles and tightening but I will try it for another week and update. Overall a very good product. I recommend this to anyone looking for fresh and clean look. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Super Moisturizer It did an excellent job of adding and trapping extra moisture into my skin. I applied it nightly for 6 days. The day/night moisturizer is the perfect combination of thick and creamy. It absorbed instantly leaving my skin feeling softer and, more importantly, appearing more radiant. I gave the product 4 stars because it did not have any impact on my thankfully, few wrinkles. I will continue to use the product to see if there will be other positive changes with long-term application. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good As A Night Moisturizer A week ago I starting using the L'OREAL Deep-Acting Moisturizer as a night lotion. I think it is too greasy to use it during the day. It is perfect for night time though. I am 45 and my skin feels very smooth and looks well hydrated after using it. The scent is not unpleasant. I am also using it on my neck and decolletage. I have not noticed anything regarding my forehead wrinkles or the fine lines around my eyes. But I have used it only for a week, it probably needs more time to see a difference in wrinkles. I have also sensitive skin and have no issues with this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Non Greasy Moisturizer- Excellent For Sensitive Skin I am in my early 30's and have been using the L'Oral Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment, and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 for 10 days now and so far I am pleased with the results: Pros: This moisturizer is wonderful for sensitive skin- it's also non greasy, and fast absorbing. I've noticed my skin is smoother and well hydrated after trying these products for 10 days. Since my skin is hydrated I also noticed less fine lines near my eyes. Con: The cream is a moderately strong scented product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great Moisturizer I love the consistency and smell of this moisturizer. It's thick without feeling oily or weighing your skin down. After a week of use my skin definitely feels softer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Big Difference This product has really kept my skin moisturized all day long. A lot of other moisturizers only work part of the day and then my skin usually feels dry again by the middle of the day. With this one....my skin looks moisturized, hydrated and it's really soft. It has a nice pleasant smell. I only wish that it was in a pump form. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"MIRACLE CREAM I can't believe how wonderful this product is. I have the driest skin in the world, nothing has really ever helped much. After one use my skin feels renewed, very silky and smooth, I feel like my face has been given a drink from the fountain of youth!!"
The Night Cream My experience with the deep power night cream was great. It felt rich and was deeply moisturizing. A little goes a long way. I used it in the morning as well under the day lotion. I love the benefits. It made my skin radiant and plumper. When used in conjunction with the serum I could see the lift. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Really Impressed I received his as a free sample! I am really impressed that I got a full-size sample! I have been using this for over a week now every night before bed I'm impressed at how moisturize my skin is in the morning. My skin is smoother brighter. I think that some people would put off by the scent. Though it smells good some don't like a strong scent. I am really happy to have this in my routine!

"Feels Great! This moisturizer is a good one. I applied the Concentrated Serum first then the Moisturizer over that morning and night. I didn't have long to review it so I can't really report on it's long-term usage. Short-term usage provided a very soft, supple feel to my skin, and even started working on smaller lines and crepiness around my eyes. I'd recommend it.

Great Moisturizer I started using this Moisturizer before bed and have really enjoyed it. I never used a moisturizer at night before and I love the way this one smells (not overwhelming at all). It has only been about a week so far but my skin feel smoother already. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Where Have You Been All My Life I have never been a big moisturizer user, that was until I tried this product.It is non greasy which is a huge plus. It's smooth and does not have a strong fragrance . I noticed a difference within a week in my skin and how it had a glow to it and how it felt as if it was tightening up. This is now a part of my daily facial routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"No More Dry Skin I think L'Oreal revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer is great. Before i started using it my face was extremely dry. After the second day of using it I had no more dry spots. You couldnt tell my skin was very dry days before. It is very easy to apply makeup over it. The only little bad thing is my nose gets a little oily through the day, but that doesnt stop me from using this great product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This Product Is Great I was able to try this product and I noticed my skin looked firmer after use. I also noticed an smoother look to my skin. The only concern I had initially is that I had a little itch after applying the cream. However, it did not last long. I would recommend this product to those looking to lift their skin naturally.

"I Like The Way L'oreal Paris Revitalift's Triple Power Moisturizer Feels On My Skin! This is not your typical moisturizer! I am now a woman in my early 40's. So, I expect my moisturizer to work overtime and provide an extra barrier of protection for my skin from the sun and the elements automatically. In addition, I need my skin to feel supple and smoothe as well to the touch like it did in my 20's! This product helps do the job. It prevents dryness and helps add moisture to my skin and face where needed!! I love it. I also like the fact that it has SPF already added as well. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer I stopped my regular cream for this for several weeks. It is a good moisturizer. Your skin feels soft and smooth. It has a great fragrance too. My skin did feel a bit oily when I woke in the morning. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Good Moisturizer This moisturizer is nice and think and I do feel that it is very moisturizing. I haven't been using it very long but have noticed some smoothing out of fine lines. I'll continuing using this moisturizer for sure! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Very rich cream I like to use this cream on my neck and collarbone to help keep my skin well moisturized, but it can be a little heavy for the skin on my face This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love Olay Regenerist Facial Moisturizer Cream I have used this facial cream for years and nothing else I have tried even comes close to this one. Love it.
Facial Moisturizer Works great as a night moisturizer. Too heavy to use during the day. Even just using this at night my skin feels so much softer. One big con is how strong the perfume smell is. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Feels Good Moisturizer It was good after initial use. The first couple of days, I broke out on my cheeks. But my face felt soft and thoroughly plush after application of moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Was Sceptical, But Was Happy With The Results. I have used this product for a week. It goes on smooth, and feel wonderful. There isn't that greasy feeling, or heavy feeling. I tend to have dry skin, and my face seems more even in tone, and healthy. It is easy to use, I put it on once out of the shower. I have used other products in the past, and this one feels so much nicer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Fan Of The Moisturizer! I've been using this product for about a week now and I've noticed a difference in hydration and firmness! It smells nice and surprisingly absorbs rather quickly. You're supposed to use it morning and night and as I have combo skin I was REALLY hesitant to use it in the morning. I get greasy by the end of the day already so I normally stay clear of super thick products like this to start my day... but I gave it a shot anyway. Oh my goodness, I was SHOCKED it absorbed so quickly and didn't leave a greasy residue! It literally goes on like thick chunks of vaseline but instantly disappears into your skin. Unbelievable! Unfortunately I've also had some odd breakouts since using this line of products, however I'm not sure if it's related or not. So far I'm enjoying the moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Helped With Dry Face The moisturizer felt great on my face. I'm pregnant and my face has been really dry lately and this helped quite a bit! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Another Step? I am lucky to get my face washed everyday so a second step is a little annoying. When I opened the jar, it seems that the product isn't filled all the way to the top which forces me to use less than I think I should. It DOES leave my skin really soft which is excellent and it makes my skin look healthier. This product is really good, I just hate the time it takes. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Facial Moisterizer Beautiful packaging, but I prefer a pump type product that I dont have to put my fingers into. This product does not have sunscreen, so I've only used it at night. It went on smoothly over the serum, but I did notice some exfoliating effect shortly after applying. I have used the product for one week, however I haven't seen any remarkable difference in my skins appearance. I wanted to know this said it was for day or night, yet it contained no SPF. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Very Moisturizing I was a little worried when I first tried this moisturizer because its a little heavier than I'd normally choose. So I decided to use it as my night cream and I was a fan after my first night! The cream is super rich, a little goes a long way and yet it feels very light on my skin. I don't feel like I'm wearing a heavy cream. It makes my skin so soft and after a few days I could already see results. I have smoother and more hydrated skin. I've noticed my fine lines are already disappearing and I look younger. I get very dry skin, living in MN but using this cream I'm not have my usual flakiness and dullness. It absorbs very quickly and goes a long way. I use it on my face, neck and decolletage and I can see my skin already looks firmer and more vibrant! I also like the fresh, clean scent. I'm excited to see how this moisturizer works over the harsh MN winter! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good For Acne Prone Skin This cream is something I can use nightly and not get a greasy face that starts breaking out. I typically cannot use moisturizers because I always break out, but after a week of using this on problems. I can see that my face is looking healthier with it and I don't have any dry flaky patches. I am excited to see how this looks after long-term use. The only thing I didn't like was it smells really strongly like perfume. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Leaves Me Slightly Oily Of the 3 products I tried, I enjoyed this one the most. I like the way my face felt for the most part. It did leave me a little more oily than usual. What I really did NOT like was that this moisturizer is heavily perfumed. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"REAL-VIEW This is a wonderful moisturizer...and thats not the only thing Regenerist offers. It smooths age lines, crows feet, laugh lines and uneven skin tones."

Fantasic Product I love the feel of this. I have only been using a week and my skin feels wonderful! I cannot wait to see further results. I recommend this product ! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer This moisturizer was easy to use, went on easily, but didn't seem to absorb very well. My skin felt too wet. I have been trying to use less and that helps. So maybe I used too much at first. I do notice that if I use it in the morning, if I get over heated or the weather is too warm it runs into my eyes. So I haven't been using it in the morning, just at bed time. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Creamy Moisturizer The moisturizer is very thick and creamy. It feels great at night, but I think it is a little too much for during the day. I adjusted the amount I used and tried a couple more days, but it's still too heavy for daytime I believe. My skin is very soft now though and I would definitely use this product again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Beautiful, Silky Feeling Moisturizer There is no other way to describe this than to say it feels this like silk. I've never had a lotion feel this way. Luxurious in feel and look. Even the container is beautiful. You feel as if you are using high end skin care. It's amazing stuff. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and super soft. The only thing I dont like about this product is the scent. The scent is rather strong and lingers for some time. It does not dissipate fast. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Pleasantly Surprised I've been using this for the past 2 weeks, replacing my old regiment. To start with, I have very sensitive, dry skin, with a long history of eczema (atopic dematitis) all over my body but worse of all on my face. Because of my history and knowing the vulnerabilities of my skin I first cleansed my face with a gentle cleanser, and PREPPED my skin with a layer of (no-fragrance/frills/sensitive skin) moisturizer before putting on top the Facial Serum Treatment and Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. Normally I just use my sensitive skin moisturizer alone. Immediately, from day 1, I felt an overall plumpness, brightness improve on my face. What grabs you initially however is the strong, almost over-powering fragrance of both serum and moisturizer. Not that it smells bad or anything, but it is quite strong. Sometime over-powering even my perfume. That's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. The product itself has been very effective for me. No irritation or itchiness despite my sensitive skin and the ability to keep my very dry skin moisturized throughout the day. I don't know how it would work for normal to oily type skin, but it has definitely gone beyond my expectations. I follow the regiment of Serum + Facial Moisturizer at least once a day. And although I have not noticed any significant improvements on my forehead wrinkles, the overall quality of my skin has improved to my surprise. Much more plump feeling and after initial application there is a notable brightness and clarity of my skin. I can't say that the brightness/plumpness lasts the entire span of the day, but it definitely does last for the hour or two immediately after application. Overall, I have been pleasantly surprised. Despite the strong fragrance, my very dry and sensitive skin has had no negative reactions, nor allergic flare-ups to the ingredients. I would definitely recommend and continue to use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Deeply Moisturizing, Feels Great! After thoroughly trying out the L'Oral RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer, I have to say that I've very much enjoyed both the instant results (deeply moisturized, not sticky or greasy, skin feels smooth and soft) and the results seen over time (skin looks and feels more plump, fine lines visibly reduced). I am looking forward to continued use and even better results. I do have two areas in which I am not happy with the product, however. Those areas would be that it is unclear whether or not the product is cruelty-free and that is something that is important to me. Also, I am not a fan of the very strong fragrance. It is kind of overwhelming and it actually gives me a slight headache until it wears off. In my opinion, facial products do not need to be fragranced! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good Cream When I first tried I thought, ok another cream for wrinkles But I change my mind when I tried because the good thing about this cream is that's your face is not grease and have a great smell. It's to soon for make a review If it really works with wrinkles, but I feel my face softer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Smooth n creamy not sticky Don't look my age. Skin looks great. Use product twice per day with super results. My older sister uses it too. She loves it. We both recommend it!
"Deep Acting Moisturizer Great moisturizer for after washing face. Thicker than other serums and creams, but did not make skin oily or break out. Smooth and silky skin. I used more around eyes due to dry skin there from allergies... big improvement! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So Far - So Good! I've used this moisturizer every day for the past two weeks and while I haven't noticed any dramatic effects I do see a change in the texture of my skin. I like the way this moisturizer feels and smells. It's rich, creamy and easy to apply (a small amount goes a long way). It's thick but absorbs quickly. And most importantly, it's not greasy! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love My Revitalift! I have been using the RevitaLift products for a few weeks now and I love the serum and deep-acting facial moisturizer combo the most! I have already started to see my fine lines around my eyes start to fade! The serum soaks in and I let it set for a few minutes before I use the deep acting facial moisturizer which is part of my bedtime routine. It smells great without being overwhelming and irritating to my skin. 3 weeks of using the products and my skin is softer, smoother, and has regained that natural glow. The only thing I have found so far that I would want to be different is the price. The RevitaLift products are more of a system and for it to be the most effective they are used in combination and it can get pricey if you purchase them all. I wish the prices would be a little less for each product or L'Oreal could offer a combo pack at a better price. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smooth Moisturizer I have to say that I love the benefits that this product has: repair wrinkles, re-firm and redensify. And it has made my skin firm. My only issue with it, is that it flaked off when I first used it. However, it does make my skin feel hydrated and radiant. Other than that, it doesn't cause irritation, and it is a great product. I look forward to seeing great results after every usage! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Rich And Creamy. Luxury In A Red Bottle I am loving this L'Oral line. I am reviewing the deep acting facial moisturizer, and can say without a doubt it has left my skin feeling fresh. There is no greasy residue and it soaks into the skin rather quickly. There is no pungent scent. Instead it has a soft, average, aroma one normally expects from moisturizers. I use this as the third step in my L'Oral skin care line, and absolutely love it. A perfect finishing product for well hydrated skin. The lotion comes in a pot, and is rich and creamy. Very easy to apply, only a small amount of product is needed. I have raved to my mother about this long enough, she's now buying her own set! Thank you for sharing such a wonderful product! Bonus pic, showing what one swipe of moisturizer looks like. You can see how creamy it is! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'oreal Paris Revital Lift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer Is Delightful! I love this product. It is so enjoyable to use. It smells wonderful. And a little goes a long way. It is hard to evaluate how well a product will work after only a short amount of time. But I do notice a softening of my skin and a slight improvement of fine lines. I am happy to be a part of this campaign. I look forward to using this until it is all gone! It feels so nice, it is not at all irritating to my skin and leaves me with a dewy feel and glow. Love it!

"Great Mosturizer I have been using the products L'Oreal Revitalift triple power deep-acting moisturizer, under eyes and lip lines about 3 weeks, and works pretty good repairing wrinkles and smoothing out fine lines. Since the first week I could see my skin hydrated and softer, and now in the third week I have seen a evident reduction in coarse lines. I would prefer a softer perfume in the product , was difficult getting used to it and the texture of the lotion is thicker and heavier than I would like. I stopped using the product in all my face in the second week because was making my skin greasy and I began to apply it only in the lines and that really function for me, and I have very good results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Good For Sensitive Skin I think this product is really good. I have been using it twice a day for over a week now and I do feel like my skin is softer though I am not sure if there is anything noticeable in terms of looking more youthful. I appreciate that it does not really have a scent but what I like about it the most is that it has not irritated my extremely sensitive skin at all. I have had no problem using this product for the last week and would consider purchasing it when I run out. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great Deep Moisturizer I've been using this for a couple weeks now. I use this at night before bed. It really soaks right in and doesn't leave a greasy feeling. It has been great with the cold weather which usually makes my skin very dry. I haven't experienced any dry skin. I gave this 4 stars because I haven't noticed any tightness or wrinkles reduced with this. It's a great moisturizer and leaves skin silky. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Super Soft Feel. I liked how the RevitalLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer actually made my face feel smooth and my wrinkles less noticeable. The only problem I had was when I added all of the products in the mornings, they left my face oily. I did notice that when I put my makeup on that the wrinkles did not show as much. I was saddened to see that they don't appear to be reducing my wrinkles in the week that I've used them. I wanted to use the product for at least a week before I posted my review, because I wanted to be honest about it. Pros: Made my face feel smooth and soft, showed less under eye wrinkles with make up, and smelled great Cons: Oily skin people need to use sparingly.

LOVE IT SO MUCH I obsessed with OLAY products can never get enough been using OLAY products since I was 14 year's old and I will be 28 in August. Keep up the Great work OLAY company.
"Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer Is Best At Night So, I used this moisturizer after applying the concentrated serum. My skin already felt great after the first step. The L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer has a nice smell and is thick and rich. It feels pretty luxurious going on. Being so thick, I knew it would help my skin retain its moisture overnight. In the morning, I could definitely still feel its presence. I had to wash my face with soap to get it off. Then it's time to do the regimen all over again. The moisturizer does not soak into the skin too much, so it feels weird to apply the sunscreen step right afterwards. As a result, I've started just using this product at night. I don't like my skin to feel weighed down during the day, but for nighttime, it's wonderful.

"Works Well With Dry Skin This product works really well on dry skin around the eyes. I recommend this for older women. It did irritate my eyes, yet worked really well on my mom. She loves it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Very Creamy, Doesn't Break Me Out. The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is so creamy and smooth going on, I worried I would break out from it. So far, so good. It's super moisturizing and has a nice light scent. I'm starting to see some improvements in my fine lines, so I hope to have good results! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Used All Three Products I was worried about using all three products, since I've had allergic reactions before. But, these were all very nice. My skin feels softer, more hydrated and looks much better after using for three weeks. I was really hoping it would help more with reducing wrinkles. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'oreal Paris Revitallift Triple Power Dee-acting Facial Moisturzer I really liked this product from the moment I applied it to my face and neck. It was not greasy and a little went a long way. I used it with L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment. I had a dry spot on the bridge of my nose and it went away with three days using both products. I have used it for three weeks and my skin feels great. Cannot say that my wrinkles have disappeared, but for 71, it has softened them. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Not A Heavy Moisturizer L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is similar to other overnight moisturizers I have tried a bit heavy. I used this with the serum at night and needed to give my face extra time to dry. The results were good with my forehead wrinkles not showing up as much. The scent was pleasant and did not feel it was overpowering. This product will be found in my future shopping cart. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Finally A Product That Works I've been trying to find the best wrinkle reducer on the market and it has been very hectic. I went into Loreal's Revitalift thinking ANOTHER BOMB. But, I tried these products and did exactly what the instructions stated. I didn't miss a day. And what I found was a product that actually works. These products, Serum, Day Moisture and Deep Moisturizer, do what they say. All three have Hyaluronic Acid in them. I don't know if that is what the key is, but I do know my skin has gotten tighter, smoother, dark spots are fading and my wrinkles are reduced. I was amazed that a drug store product can do what this does. Good Job L'Oreal. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Excellent For Night Time Use This L'oreal Facial Moisturizer is really great for the overnight hours. It goes to work and leaves your skin feeling really refreshed in the morning. Has a nice soothing scent and isn't greasy. While I can't say that my skin has less lines or more tightness, it is very hydrated and looks fresh, and at my current age, that's good for me. May have even better effects over time. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'oreal Revitalift I really like this product.. while I'm not positive I see a difference in the look of my skin so much, I love the feel and fragrance of this cream. I especially like it at night. I have used this cream in tandem with the revitalift serum and find it works nicely. It has a much thicker and luxurious feel than most creams I have used and I feel that it is moisturizing my skin. It is definitely a product I would buy and use daily. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer I love the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer!

"Great Nighttime Moisturizer But Has A Strong Fragrance I normally do not use nighttime moisturizers, but decided to try out the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. It has a thick and creamy consistency but spread on my face easily and did not feel greasy. A little goes a long way so don't use too much! I was not a fan of the fragrance. I personally like creams on my face that have no powerful smell, because it bothers me and keeps me awake since I keep smelling it. I woke up to a fresh-feeling face. The cream did not stain my pillow and by morning I no longer could smell the fragrance. My skin was soft, smooth and hydrated. I am very happy with this moisturizer with the exception of the fragrance. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Luxurious Moisturizing Cream Without Heavy Or Greasy Feel! Luxurious Moisturizing Cream without Heavy or Greasy Feel! Usually a cream that feels this great leaves a residue on my face. This cream absorbed very quickly let my face feeling soft and smooth. Very light weight on the skin and non--greasy! I was very surprised! I tend to have combination skin with some oil around my nose area and just did not make my skin oily at all! The only thing that I would like is a different container. I don't like that I open the lid and I'm putting my finger or a cotton swab into it, because I feel that the product is exposed to the air and contaminates. Other than that, I love it!

"Okjkenda57 I am a bit older that maybe some and I thought why not try these products the L 'Oreal Paris Revitalift facial moisture and was pleasantly surprised I am kind of picky with these types of products as some leave your skin oily or they feel greasy - this product was neither of those things it felt light and creamy and did wonderfully in the dryer spots on my face --- I have used it for about 10 days and my face does look brighter and I love the end result fr I hope to continue to see progess , my face fells fuller and looks like it is glowing This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My Revitallift Experience Before I get a product I would want to know what it specifically does, what other user's reactions where to it, and if the company that produces it is known to deliver what is promised. Overall i'd say that had a good experience with L'Oreal RevitalLift. I tried the concentrated facial serum, the deep acting facial moisturizer and the facial day lotion SPF 20. I've been using them for about a week now and I really like the affect they've had on my skin. I had been looking for a product to soften my skin and make it look smoother and healthier and RevitaLift did just that. My face is very soft to the touch now and the products have a great fragrance to them. The only thing I didn't like is that my face is a little shiny. I'd be very interested to know what products are offered for people with oily skin. I have noticed this product before while shopping, but I thought it was a little too expensive. Now that i've had a chance to try it, i'll definitely consider purchasing it in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Quality Moisturizer. The RevitaLift deep-acting moisturizer has a thick consistency that absorbs into the skin, leaving it refreshed and moisturized. I have used this product alone and with the RevitaLift serum, and either way it feels heavy on my skin. I thought at first that it felt that way because it was used in combination with the serum, but even when I tried it alone, it felt like it sat on top of my skin for a long time. Once it's absorbed, the skin feels soft and refreshed, but if you need something that's quick, this might not work for your routine. Also, the first time I used this it was in my morning routine and after 3-5 minutes of letting it settle into my skin, I put my make-up primer on only to have it all roll off in little clumps on my fingers! I use an expensive primer that I use sparingly, so I don't feel it was the amount used, I think it's a bad combination of the gel-based primer and moisturizer together. Pros: The pros are that a little goes a LONG way. I used the moisturizer for 7 days and literally just used what was on the lid. It's a thick, creamy, lightly-scented moisturizer that I look forward to putting on my skin. Cons: The cons are that it takes a while to absorb into the skin - I've made this a part of my nightly skincare routine only because my mornings tend to be fast-paced. It doesn't mix well with my make-up primer, meaning its limited to when I am not going to wear make-up, but that's not a deal breaker for me. Overall, the product is as effective as some of the more expensive products I've tried and once absorbed into the skin, its effects are noticeable. My skin feels and looks refreshed.

Lotion Spf 20 i love how it makemy face feel and look. i been useing it for two weeks now and i will buy more when it im out. thank you This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Moisturize Mousturize Mousturize! I really like this product! Not only am I working on fixing my wrinkles by using this product I also get a moisturizer that actually works on my face! It is incredibly dry where I am from. I am very pleased with this product. The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because of the scent. For someone who is sensitive to scents it is a little strong. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Smooth Skin I'm 33 years old with the beginnings on wrinkles that are starting to stick out when I'm not squinting or smiling. I tried a Neutrogena product first that really did nothing for me. I have combination skin that tends to break out sometimes in the cold weather. I have redness and rough spots as well as furrow lines, smile lines and fine lines by my eyes. I feel that this product hydrates my skin perfectly. If you have oily skin, it may be too much. After a week my wrinkles are appear a bit smoother, my skin is more even and my makeup goes on super smooth. The smell is nice, clean and crisp. This product is not extremely on the high side so I would definitely consider purchasing in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Seeing Some Results!! The smell is great. It makes my skin soft and smooth. I can see some difference in my skin. I am loving this. I would recommend this. It is a great product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Feels good Use it every day it has made a profound difference
"Long Lasting Moisture! I really like this product because coupled with the serum applied at night, I felt that my skin stayed moisturized through the night and day. It spreads very well, has a light scent that disappears in minutes and does not feel heavy or greasy on my skin. It deserves 3 stars, but I gave the product four stars because it was the only product out of the three that I felt did something- something being it moisturized. I didn't notice any changes in refirming or redensifying my skin, but I do like the product. I probably would not buy again unless after finishing the jar I notice something that really does it for my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Deep Down Softness I think my face has taken on a new look. My skin is softer and healthier looking. Applying this product is fast and easy to do and gives such a radiant look to my skin that I think I am in love with it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Silky And Smooth! I especially like the creamy feel of the L'Oreal Triple Power Deep-Acting RevitaLift Facial Moisturizer. It goes on cool and leaves your face with an incredibly silky feel to it, but not greasy. I like using it in the morning because the cool sensation helps to get me motivated for my day! My only complaint about the L'Oreal RevitaLift is that it is a little perfumey after you have it on for a few minutes. I have some dry areas on my face, especially in the winter, and it slightly irritates those areas when I used the lotion at night. Plus, I just prefer softer fragrances for my facial moisturizers. Overall, I love the silky, smooth way that my face feels after using L'Oreal Triple Power Deep-Acting Revitalift Moisturizer for over a week. I will continue to put it on in the mornings when I'm getting ready for work. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love The Way This Smells!!! I used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and i absolutely love the was this moisturizer smells. The scent isn't too strong but leaves your face with a great scent. I used this every morning after washing my face and my face looks smoother and feels softer. I did find it to be a bit greasy but i wil still continue to use this product. I really liked it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Moisturizers Like None Other! I think this product is great!! I use this in the evening before bed. It feels like it might go on heavy but it absorbs quickly and feels light in minutes. My face feels moisturized and healthy. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Rich, Creamy Face Lotion I really enjoy this facial lotion. The lid is a little slippery and hard to open if your hands are wet or have serum on them from your 1st product. This product smells nice and clean and is a thick, creamy lotion. It spreads nice and smooth. After applying it to my face, it looks dewy and soft. I enjoy the way it feels on my face and how easy it goes on. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Wow !! Pleasantly Surprised I've only been using for two (2) wks. but think I see a change in the texture of my skin. I also love how rich and creamy it is and lasts for several hours on my skin. I sometimes use it 3X a day. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"L'oréal Revitalift Facial Moisturizer I really like this product! It is very rich in texture and feels cool on the skin. I have normal to dry skin and I can definitely feel it my skin soak up the product. It doesn't feel greasy, but when applying it feels a little heavy but once it drys, weightless. A great everyday moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Rich Night-time Moisturizer I've been using L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer every night for the last two weeks. At first I was using it along with the Revitalift serum, but I found that this combination was just too rich for my face and I was waking up with an oily complexion, so I switched to using the moisturizer on its own and have had much better results. What this does tell me is that this might be a perfect match for those who struggle with extremely dry skin! I have noticed some difference in my complexion over the two weeks - most noticeably that my previously dry skin is now well moisturized - even over moisturized. I love the scent of this product - it is light and fresh. The packaging is beautiful and luxe, however it is simply a jar, not a pump, so if you are concerned about bacteria you may want to use a spatula or spoon with this product. I removed 1 star for this. A little goes a long way and with once a day use I anticipate this 1.7 oz jar lasting me 3-4 months - a great value for the price! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
L'oreal Campaign the product was a real good product but due to price of the product I will not be purchasing may if the price was lower more people could buy the product This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Works much faster than had anticipated. After applying for only a week I noticed a few of those hairline wrinkles around my eyes going back where they came from!
"Love This Moisturizer!!! My new favorite moisturizer! It's the same light floral scent as the other revitalift moisturizers, which I love. The little jar this moisturizer is in is cute, yet sophisticated - I love seeing it on my bathroom shelf! The moisturizer itself is this great thick, creamy texture. You do need to keep rubbing it until thoroughly absorbed - like the jar says. At first, I thought it might be too heavy, but once fully absorbed it is perfect. I especially love it for night time - my skin drinks it right up. I truly believe it has made my skin smoother and more youthful in just a few weeks of use. I do think some people (maybe with super oily skin) might find it too much for daytime wear. I would say my skin is normal to oily, and I don't always reach for this for a daytime moisturizer. But, I use it religiously at night! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Power Concentrated L'oreal Facial Serum I think there has been some improvement in the wrinkle department . I am not sure why one needs to use two separate products twice a day. It is a lot of cream on my face, and in the second photo you may see that my face, especially my cheeks get quite red after application. That worries me a bit. Also the fragrance is a bit strong for my nose, but it is a good one, just a little less would be good. The two products go on easily and seem to penetrate the skin right away. The jar for the Deep acting moisturizer may look nice, but the square top is not as easy to open and close.i am only able to submit one photo, but a previous one show MORE wrinkles than this one (after 2 weeks of application) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I Like It So Far... I have been using the product for a little over a week and so far I like what I am seeing. While I haven't noticed any reduction in wrinkles, I do like how soft my skin feels since beginning to use the product. My skin also looks and feels healthier, less red. I do find that the moisturizer feels a little bit heavy, but so far, so good. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Glowing N Happy I had neglected my skin for a while and it had become dull n unhappy. I used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment for 15 days now, my skin is already happy. It seems it has come back to life. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Rich Luxurious Moisture After the first time trying the night cream, I felt immediate smoothness to my skin. It was a thick cream but went on smoot had a nice scent. I have been using it for the last week and a half and have noticed my skin looking nice and firm and almost younger looking. This is definitely a product I will be using for a while.

"High Quality Moisturizer! I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review on a product review website and I love it so much that I wanted to make sure my review was posted here too. gotitfree This moisturizer smells great and comes in a very sleek looking red glass jar. A little bit goes a long way. I have been using the product for almost 3 months and I am still on my first jar! I use it in combination with the Revitalift Concentrated Serum at night (I use the concentrated serum with the Revitalift Triple Power Day Lotion during the day). My face looks and feels great! The only downside I have experienced is that the moisturizer feels thick when I first put it on, which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I just make sure I use it 10-15 minutes before I lay down on my pillow at night. Great, quality product that is priced well since it lasts for so long! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A Little Bit Heavy But Good I found this lotion a bit heavy, so I used it as a night cream, even though they said it's for day or night. That's my only complaint, though. Otherwise, it does remove fine lines and wrinkles as promised. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer Could Be For You It's nice that I can grab as little or as much as I want to use. The smell pleasant and not overly powerful. I did not notice my allergies acting up during my use of the product. The serum has a nice smooth texture and, like the serum, did not give me the greasy feeling that some other products tend to do. I would definitely recommend this product but wish it had step by step directions regarding the order in which you should use the products. They are on the box however, for someone who is forgetful keeping the boxes are cumbersome. My skin does feel smoother and has a nice healthy glow , however I did not see an improvement (yet) on the lines in my forehead (which are really the only deep lines I currently have). I am hoping that by the end of the bottles I'll see more of an improvement. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Face Cream I really liked this product. It smelled good, goes on smooth, and really moisturizes. Not greasy. Easy and no mess at bedtime. Dries enough to wear under my makeup. Without cream, my face is dry and flaky. Not a problem after using this product daily. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great Product But Not For Me I started to use this regimen and actually bought the cleanser to get the complete experience. The reason I don't think the product is for me is because I broke out on day 3 of using it. Now I know that this can happen when you begin a new skin care treatment and yes I could've waited it out maybe but I broke out alot around my chin area mostly. The reason Im still giving this a 4 star is because I gave the product to my mother and she absolutely loves it. She noticed visible changes within a few days and is excited about continuing with the products. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This is an Amazing Product Us this for many years and love love love it. One of the best products Olay has!!!!
"Good Dry Skin Moisturizer I like this product as a night cream. It's not super heavy but if you put too much it does have a tendency to leave a 'greasy' layer. I used this in conjunction with 2 other RevitaLift moisturizers - the serum (which I use under this) the day cream with spf (which I use during the day) - but the results have been fairly noticeable especially for the 'testing' only being 15 days!!! (I had late shipping). I have normal to dry skin - with some days a bit oily in my T zone - but def leans towards dry. I do not recommend this for oily or acne/breakout prone skin. I also wouldn't use under makeup , as it's a pretty heavy duty cream. But for me it worked. I was overall pretty satisfied. The scent is a bit strong too for those whom prefer their face/skin care products to be scent free - not for y'all. After using this with the serum and day cream I have noticed more evening or skin tone - 'brightening' if you will , and some of the fine lines on my forehead seem to be a bit softer. I'm sure with continued use the results will keep on getting better. Thx BzzAgent and Loreal !!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My First Time Using A Serum I had never used a serum product before, so I had no expectations going in. Either that or I expected magic and miracles... Now I'm not sure. I used the product for three weeks. The first thing I noticed was that for a week, I couldn't wear it under make up because my face would peel. It stopped after a week and I learned to use less product. My most noticeable result was on my freckles. It lightened them! Like for real!! How rad is that!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Super Soft Skin This product applies well. It's really creamy and absorbs fast. The smell isn't as intense as the serum, which is nice. I haven't noticed much difference in my skin as a whole, but my make up goes on much more smoothly. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Perfect Together I think that the deep acting moisturizer pairs awesome with the other products in the same line, they do not tend to get overly greasy which is HUGE with moisturizer. It doesn't cause you to break out which is a major problem I personally was having. I have already recommended this product to many people and I will continue to do so. As well as buy more for myself! I am so happy i was able to product test this and voice my opinion, I think alot of people will benefit from this! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Very Effective! I tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLife Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. I'm used to a lighter type of moisturizer, so I found that a little of this product goes a long way. I was happy with the way this product moisturized my face. It went on smooth, with no greasy feel. It also absorbed into my skin quickly and left a smooth finish. I would recommend this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Feeling Very Moisturized This hydrates my skin perfectly, so much so that I don't need my face cream. If you have oily skin, it might be too much for you. After two weeks my skin is more even and my makeup goes on super smooth on my former rough patches. The smell is nice, clean and crisp. I highly recommend this, especially for those looking for a good product on the cheap. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Another Great Product Love this one also. This can be used day and night. A little heavier and prefer to use at night. Although I did use it both morning and night for awhile. Noticeable difference in only a few weeks. Skin is smoother and feels very soft. Wrinkle/frown lines look better. Only gave 4 of 5 stars because not me but some may be bothered by the smell of the product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"One Of The Best Lotions I've Tried! This lotion is awesome!! It really soaks deep into your skin. I have a lot of problems with lotions making my face itch because it's super sensitive. This whole set did not do that!! I have super flaky skin, so I try any lotion that is supposed to be thicker this one really helped with the dryness of my skin. My routine is to wash my face, dry, apply serum, then apply the deep-acting facial moisturizer. Now that we are going into the cold months, I'll apply this over the triple power day lotion. I have been able to get my daughter mother to use this trio of products both love them! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
A Great Moisturizer That Really Makes You Feel Younger!! I tried L'Oreal Paris Rivitalift Triple Power deep action moisturizer and found it to work very well at rejuvenating the look of my skin. The face looks and feels firmer and smoother. It's a great product and I would recommend. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great Night Time Moisturizer! Sometimes, nighttime moisturizer can clog my combination pores and make me break out, but this was a great product. It really plumped my skin and never felt greasy. I woke up with smooth, soft skin! Great product at a great price. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great The results were fast. And it feels great on my skin. I would regiment it to anyone.
"Thick Cream I have been using this cream nightly for about two weeks. So far, I like the generous amount of product in the package and the consistency, which is thick but still smooth and non-greasy. It has a mild fragrance. It's too early to tell if it works to reduce fine lines, but it certainly hasn't broken out my skin, and my skin feels smooth. I carefully examined all the ingredients to make sure they are safe for my skin, and I was pleased with the ingredient list. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Deep Action I've tried all 3 as a whole. The first day I wasn't sure what to think. Because as it started to work my face was a little tingly. But as I started using it daily my face is more soft and moisturized. I will be recommending this product to all my friends. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Love It! Great Product! I think the L'Oreal Paris revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer is awesome. My dry face is now a healthy looking face. Thanks Bzz for giving me the opportunity to meet such an amazing moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Skin-tastic! I want to give the product more time to give a better review. However, I was excited about being able to try out the L'oreal Paris RevitaLift system. Overall I thought that items came in a timely and was well packaged. I was also pleased with the size of the system. I noticed that there were at least two other products mentioned on the packages. I would have loved to have been able to try them in this review to get the full effects of the entire system. I like how my face looks and feels. The system claims to work on all skin types, I am African American so I thought that it would not work. I also, was exited to see what would happen when trying the product because I have combination skin. I was was both pleased and surprised. I will continue to use the system and I am strongly thinking of adding the cleanser and eye cream also. Great buy and worth the money! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Good Job L'oréal! I like the products a lot. I was surprised because I was sure it would cause an allergic reaction but it didn't. My skin felt smoother and plumper after a few days. The only thing I don't love is that it is highly scented. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"I Like This Facial Moisturizer I was thrilled to get a chance to try L'Oreal facial moisturizer as I already use many other products offered by them. I love this facial moisturizer. It makes my skin feel very soft and smooth, especially during these winter months. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Hydration I was apprehensive to try the entire Revitalift line because I do have somewhat sensitive skin, but also because I'm very prone to clogged pores and blackheads. Once I find a routine that works for me, I tend to stick with it for a long time, and only experiment with one or two different items at a time. About my skin: I have combo skin that leans towards oily. However, because I use a prescription retinol lotion each night, my skin does get dry. And sometimes, it gets really dehydrated so I have flaking skin on my nose which is also oily - it's not cute. First application I noticed that there was a strong smell. I happen to really like the scent, it reminds me of a L'Oreal hair conditioner that I used to use. I will say that the scent lasted on my skin for quite some time, so if you're highly sensitive to fragrance or you just prefer unscented skin care products, this might not be for you. The moisturizer smooths over the skin and feels really pleasant when applied. I did note that this was a bit heavy for me, but that's most likely because I do have some issues with oil. I used it for some time at night, and once under makeup when my skin was being particularly troublesome, and I did wake up with smoother and softer skin that felt really hydrated. However, it did clog my pores up. I definitely didn't have an issue with breakouts and it wasn't huge, but I did notice some extra clogged pores and a slight increase in blackheads while using this product. Overall, this is a great night moisturizer, especially with winter weather coming. I will definitely continue to use on my neck and chest, and I'll use it on my face when it's extra dry. I also used this as an intensive hand treatment and I LOVED it for that. I think this would be best geared toward drier skin types, because it is a bit heavy for oily skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Rich And Creamy Moisturizer The L'Oral Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer felt very rich and creamy. Even though I applied a thin layer on my face it felt thick and heavy. It was also very fragrant which I thought could sometimes be overwhelming. However, after the first week of using this moisturizer I noticed that my skin felt smoother to the touch. After 3 weeks my skin felt and looked somewhat firmer. However, I would like more time to actually confirm this statement. I applied the moisturizer in the morning after I cleansed my face and again at night after I cleansed my face before bedtime. Based on the results of this moisturizer I would definitely recommend it. The thickness and fragrance wouldn't be enough of a negative for me not to recommend it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Amazing Results With This! I think the smell is just perfect. You know it's something but you don't smell like a walking cream cabinet. Highly recommend this for a nice deep moisture lock. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
A New Staple In My Facial Care I think I've 5 found a new staple in my facial care. The combo of all three products is awesome. The moisturizer leaves your skin feeling baby soft. There's no unpleasant smell or over powering odor. The cream goes on smoothly and spreads well. I can tell the difference when I don't use it. I have no more dry dpots on my face. If you're looking for something to rejuvenate your skin this is it. Definitely a new staple in my skin care. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Works No one knows my age, and are very surprised when I tell them!"
"Awesome Product i tend to get really dry patches in areas of my face that can look quite dull even when i moisturized....until I started using the L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple ower Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer...now my skin just glows to the point where even my BF mentions it. The biggest plus of this, apart from younger looking skin is that it contains an spf that doesn't feel heavy! love it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
So Soft Skin I used the moisturizer every morning and my face felt so amazing. It was so smooth. I would recommend this product to people who have very dry skin and trying to help with their dryness will love this moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"So Far, So Good So far, I've really like this moisturizer. I use it at night and wake up to super soft skin. However, sometimes I feel like I can still feel it on my face once I wake up, like it wasn't completely absorbed. Not sure if that's a bad thing or not. But I'm still liking it althought it hasn't been a miracle worker or anything. I haven't really noticed a decrease in wrinkles or sun spots, but my skin has been soft and clear, and I'm super happy with that. This has the same scent as the other two products in this line, the serum and day lotion, which is quite frangrant. It's not a bad smell, I actually rather like it, but if someone is sensitive to smells, this may be too much for them. Just something to keep in mind. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great For Night Use I love what this does to my skin. It feels so soft and smooth when I wake up. I tried using it during the day but it's a bit too thick and didn't completely absorb into my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"A Little Heavy, But Effective I've been using the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer primarily as part of my nighttime routine. I found it a little too heavy to wear during the day in addition to the serum and spf day moisturizer. It's very thick, but doesn't go on greasy. It absorbs well into the skin, and does leave my skin feeling soft. I had some trial and error time figuring out that more than once a day for this moisturizer was too much for me. Additionally, if I attempt to put make up over it, it feels a little like the two mix together and crumble off my skin. Used at night before bed though, I wake up with my skin feeling soft. I think it's a good option for a nighttime moisture surge. As with the other two products, my big complaint is with the scent, which reminds me of a cheap hotel shampoo or bar of soap. Not a smell I revel in. Thankfully application time is the only time I smell it, but I would certainly prefer something a little more feminine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Triple Power Facial Serum And Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer I am still undecided about these products and continue to use them. I think I see some improvement in my skin but not positive yet. It has been about 3 weeks now and I think my skin tone has improved and one wrinkle between my brows seems less. The only thing I do not like is the products seems to block my pores, when I sweat I feel very greasy and more uncomfortable than usual so I may just use it at night.

"A Regular/standard Moisturizer The moisturizer has the same consistency than other regular creams available in the Pharmacy. Is a heavy, oily and thick cream. I used it twice a day, in the morning and night. After Serum (Include neck). Nice scent, not heavy perfumed. And mild for use in sensitive skin (like me). After the serum, moisturizer, sunscreen I applied face primer, liquid base and powder. A lot of coats in my face but nevertheless, didn't feel too heavy or the skin breathless. So many products don't caused skin break outs. My only complaint, it's the oily and shine look during the rest of the day. Need to retouch the face with blotting Paper or Oil Control Powder. That's a con for the product. It's a good/regular product to consider to buy in the future, have a nice price. Really accessible. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice And Light Nice, light and not too heavy for my skin. I'm not a fan of the scent. Very light, but floral. It seems to go well with the facial serum, doesn't plug pores. It gets along very well with my skin type. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer I used this product along with the serum as recommended on the packaging. At first I did not like the way this product felt combined with the serum. It felt heavy on my skin, and a little bit goopy, so I wasn't expecting to end up liking it as much as I did. After about 2 minutes of allowing the product to dry, the heavy, goopy feeling disappears, leaving your skin feeling very soft and refreshed. I thought that if I were to continue to use these products, I would have to do so separately at different times of day, but I was pleasantly surprised that they ended up working so well together! My only complaint with this set of products is the scent. I'm very sensitive to scents, so even the lightest one can be overpowering to me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good Stuff The deep-acting facial moisturizer is pretty good. I liked how it felt on my skin when I was putting it on. I could tell the difference in how my skin felt after using it all this time. The moisturizer smells good, though just a tad overpowering. However, the smell does get less immediately after pouring it on. I have had the experience of it peeling though. Over all, it's a great product. It's worth using it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loving This Moisturizer !!! I love this moisturizer! L'oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer has made my skin soft and brighter. The moisturizer gave my face a natural beautiful glow. My co-workers were asking me if I was pregnant because my skin was so bright. They said I had the glow. I told them, no way I just got a new moisturizer, lol. I was looking for a a daily skin regimen. After noticing such great results from using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Action Facial Moisturizer along with the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment along with L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power I have found my new regimen! The products are not caky, gritty or sticky. They are nice and smooth, easy to apply. The only down side to these products for me would be the weight. The containers are a little heavy to throw in your bag for a quick overnight. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great Daytime Moisturizer This is a perfect daytime moisturizer paired with the L'Oreal Revitalift Serum. I tend to have dry skin and this has definitely regulated my skin. I have used this product for 2 weeks now and have noticed more even skin and subtle tightening of the skin. Would definitely recommend this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great Moisturizer! Usually, my face is a mix of oily and dry, but this really helped with my dry skin (which I focused more on) without making my face feel greasy! It felt light underneath of my make-up and that is really important because I apply make-up everyday for work and it tends to dry my face out. I've tried so many different moisturizers, but this one worked really well! The only reason that I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is that I wasn't a huge fan of the smell. It was a bit strong for me - especially being applied to my face. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Knock Out Winter Dryness! The RevitaLift Triple Power Moisturizer really felt great. I have very sensitive skin and the dryness is particularly bad in the winter. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Nice Product! I've used this a few times so far and really do like it. It has a light floral scent that's not overpowering, goes on smooth and fairly light. It felt good on my face though it did feel a bit sticky on my hands after so I did need to rinse them for comfort. But on my face it didn't feel that way. I've not noticed a change in my skin yet but it does feel good. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
L'oriel Revitalift Concertrated Serum I think that the L'Oriel Revitalift line is fantastic! I have used it for the last several weeks have certainly noticed a difference in my skin. My friends have even asked me what I have been using on my face. First the concentrated serum immediately absorbs into the skin! Not oily feel and I really like the consistency. I use it morning and evening on my face neck. I have certainly noticed smoother skin and less dark spots under my eyes. I have noticed less puffiness especially in the am. After this step I use the triple power cream. This is a little thicker but works nicely to moisturize the skin. In the mornings I use the day lotion. I especially love this because it contains SPF 20 so that eliminates the extra sunscreen step. I feel that this product is great for your skin. It keeps you looking young! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"I use the complete Olay Regenerist Line. I'm 45, my skin is sensitive and very dry. I use Olay Regenerist Hydration Moisturizer, the Eye repair, I use the Olay foaming face wash. I saw the difference in my skin in less than a week. I love all the products, including the body wash, and after body wash lotion. Great line of products and great prices. Thanks!"
Skin Feels Firmer And I Like That Look I have been using this product for a little over a week now. I love that it provides sun protection. It feel great under my makeup and my skin feels firmer. It absorbs quickly which is great for me since I am always rushing around! It isn't greasy and I really like the smell. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Keep Your Skin Young Looking With L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer I mistakenly previously reviewed this product and was thinking it was the serum...so this is correct review. Sorry. When I first tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, I would apply it after using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment as a second step.I also used it twice a day, in the morning and again in the evening. It is easy to use and it is a cream. I liked the idea that it was helping my skin and contains Pro-Xylane which stimulates collagen production. I would apply it to my face and also my neck. But it leaves a coated feeling which I did not like. It doesn't seem to be absorbed into the skin completely like the serum. So now I just apply it in the evening only. Still love that it is working on my skin. I find it my job to keep my skin young looking and this makes my job so much easier...I would recommend it, but only for night time use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I'm  Loving This Stuff To start with, this stuff smells great. Very lightly scented, not overwhelming at all. I love the texture, too. It goes on nicely and makes my skin feel great. I've been using it for about 2 weeks and right off the bat I noticed how soft and smooth my skin felt. Just recently I've been seeing my skin tone has been evening out. My only complaint would be my skin did get oily for a while. I had to cut back on my use and is seemed to have gotten better. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer This is a somewhat thick, moisturizing cream. It is very emollient and leaves you skin feeling extremely hydrated. I think this would be absolutely great for dry skin. I have normal/combo skin (oily in t-zone) and this just has too much moisture for my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Positive Moisturizing Results I use the L'Oreal Paris revitalift Triple Power deep acting facial moisturizer in conjunction with the facial serum treatment. I would first use the facial serum treatment followed by the moisturizer. I had a very positive experience with the moisturizer. I found it to be thick but upon application did not feel heavy upon my face. I use both these products everyday for the past 3 weeks and have noticed and overall General reduction in the wrinkles and smoothness of my skin. It is a product I would consider continue using for my facial needs. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Liked More Than The Other Two I enjoyed this product the most of the set. Scent and texture were good and left face feeling fresh. As for results, I have yet to see..... But will continue using. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Facial Serum Treatment I really liked how it made my face feel. It was a little greasy, though. I would buy the product again to see if it had lasting results. I am wondering what other products to pair it with This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Really Nice This is a really nice moisturizer. Its not at all greasy and has a really light fragrance to it. I am particularly pleased that this product doesnt make my face oily or shiny throughout the course of the day. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Very Thick And Moisten Your Face. This is a rather thick cream. It comes in a jar and little dab will be enough if you don't like it very thick on your skin. I have a combination skin, so it gives me a little oily feeling around my chin and nose when I put it on. It is perfect for the cold dry air during the winter. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A Little Goes A Long Way... I used this product after putting on the serum every night after washing my face. It is very heavy, so I only liked to use it at night. I did enjoyed the smell, but if you like little to no fragrance this is not for you. I feel like I noticed fewer lines after using both products for a few weeks, and my face seemed to have more even coloring. I think it's too heavy to wear during the day and will leave a greasy feeling. A little dab of this product goes a long way. However, the end result was a softer, moisture rich, and even complexion for my and that made me happy! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Very pleased great moisturizer for day or night. I use this all the time. Highly recommend for problem skin or sensitive skin. I suffer from psoriasis and during stress outbreaks I have used this on those spots.
"Rich Moisturizing Goodness!! I've been using the L'Oreal RevitaLift Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for the past 3 days I'd like to tell ya my thoughts on it. First, like the RevitaLift serum, I love the packaging. The jar is a lovely shade of red fits perfectly into the palm of your hand. Now, when you first feel the texture of the cream, although it's smooth, it is rather thick to the touch. Surprisingly, once it's applied to the face, it doesn't feel very heavy at all!! It definitely leaves your face feeling soft smooth. Lastly, the scent is a bit stronger than the serum in the collection but I don't find it to be overwhelming. Overall, I really like this facial lotion will continue using it to see what it can do long term. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Holy Grail This product is part of my holy grail. Ever since I started using this product I seen a drastic change in my skin. My skin feels firmer tighter and hydrated I use it before my makeup and it does wonders. I absolutely love this product and I would recommend it to any friends or family I ran into. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great Night Time Moisturizer I used this product in conjunction with the Serum and it was great. I woke up with my face smoother and very soft. It is non-greasy and goes on very well. It was absorbed into my skin quickly and I was not left with the feeling that my face still had lotion left on it. The smell is quite pleasant also and not too overpowering. I look forward to seeing the long term affects of this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Good Moisturizer Leave skin feeling nice soft and smooth and moisturized. Would be better if it didn't leave me looking so shiny especially in my tzone were I am already oily. Also if the scent weren't so storng, doesn't really bother me but for those who are sensitive to scented product this is not for them This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice Weight, Very Moisturizing Found this to be a good weight for lots of moisture and seems to absorb quite quickly. Probably best as a night moisturizer. Scent is pretty strong, but I didn't find it unpleasant. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smells So Good After using the serum I applied the moisturizer. So far I love everything about it from the texture to the smell. It applied very easly and is non greasy. I used a qtip to get it out of the jar the one thing Im not a fan of is opened jars because I feel like it can easily grow bacteria,especially when people stick their fingers in it. I also took a before picture and cant wait to see what my skin looks like after. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Leaves Skin Feeling Soft I was surprised how much I found I like this moisturizer. I found my skin felt softer even after 1 use. I also felt that my skin was slightly firmer as well due to having Hyaluronic Acid which helps combat signs of aging. I am more than pleasantly surprised on how non-greasy it feels on my face. I think L'Oral Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer works just as well as some of the higher end brands. I also feel it works even better as part of the Triple Power regiment with the serum and lotion. I would highly recommend all 3 products together in any woman looking to combat signs of aging.

L'oreal Revitalift Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer I loved how easy to use and how light it felt on my skin. The words deep-acting on my combination skin made me worried but there was no reason to worry at all. I use it at night so it has overnight to work its magic and I'm always very impressed how soft my skins feels when I wake up. Don't be afraid try this product!!

"Worked Great So Far I think this works great ! The weather has changed and my skin gets so dry n cracks when I wear my foundation, so I always need a thick moisturizer. The first time I used this it immediately turned my skin soft not greasy. Next day I used it under my makeup. My face looked good. So this was a great product my faces is also a little tighter. Loved this ! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Better Than I Expected I have acne prone skin. I was very nervous trying this product because I did not know if it would make my acne worse. After only one day, I woke up to my acne spots were so much smaller and kess noticeable! I know its supposed to help fine lines and wrinkles but it really helps with acne, too. I Liked the clean smell of the product, and it was not greasy or oily. It left my face feeling great, and it really dissolved into my skin and didn't just sit on my skin like other products. My face was super soft when I woke up this morning. I would buy Loreal Revitalift! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
The product feels great in the skin I have used this product for a few years and love it. It provides great moisture and smells great too. My skin feels terrific

"Firming Cream I have tried just about everything. This claims to have firming properties. I really haven't noticed too much of a difference but I just started using it. My problem areas are my lower cheek areas are losing firmness. It does make my skin feel silky and pretty though. So, for minimal sagging or loss of firmness, this will help. I will need to write another review after using this for awhile."
"Wrinkle Reducer I love the product, the wrinkles disappeared mostly. However, I didn't care for the strong perfume smell and after several days use I started to get acne."
Tried Revitalift instant absorption non greasy didn't blur my vision
Awesome Face Lotion Great product! My skin feels refreshed and younger.
"Moisture Love It I received a jar of ReviaLift Triple Power, Deep-Acting Moisturizer, 1st I was so surprised when I got it, 2nd I love it. My skin is always very dry nothing I have tried no matter how expensive seems to give me the hydration my face needs. Years of trying this and that and I have found my dream moisturizer, day and night. I saw a huge difference in my skin after just 4 days, and it keeps getting better, more radiant, suple, and moist. If you havent tried it buy it, you wont regret it."
Loved The Thickness And Creaminess. I loved the texture of this and the way it made it made my skin feel.
"feels great Very soft powdery feel. Absorbs nicely. I really like this product, it doesn't feel sticky or oily on my skin."
Excellent Moisturizer This is a great moisturizer. I love the texture and the scent. I didn't notice any difference in the appearance of my skin except for not being as dry.
Rich This cream was super thick. It felt great on and my skin was noticabley firmer. I would consider putting this into my reguler skin regimin.
"Feels Great I love how this makes my skin feel: moisturized without being oily. My face just feels relaxed and smooth after putting this on, and the cream is nice and lightweight, not sticky like some moisturizers."
"So Far So Good I am 2 days in,using this product. An already my skin looks smoother and my forehand lines seem less visible. Can't wait to see the end results!"
"Moisturizing And Lovely!!! Love the texture, love the scent, love the tightening sensation!!! This is a winner!"
Fingers Crossed.. I started using a week ago and so far-so good.. I have noticed some firming and lines are becoming less noticeable. So I will continue and see where it takes me..
"Very Moisturizing Rich moisturizer. If you want a moisturizer that hydrates,this is it."
"Very Moisturizing I was drawn to this product because it promised triple power. Instead of using 3 products this would do it all. I used it everyday for the past 2 weeks and while I don't see any dramatic results, I do think it feels and smells good. It is moisturizing and that alone is beneficial. I will continue to use it and hopefully will see more improvement in my skin."
"Triple Power Triple Great I have been using the new Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer for about 10 days. I have very sensitive skin and alot of products will cause my skin to tingle and become very red, this product however has not done any of that. I feel that I am already seeing some great results, especially in the elasticity of my skin, escpecially around the jaw line and chin area..I hope to see continued results from this product."
"Love Everythig Except It Didn't Soak Into My Skin! I really loved the smell of it, the consistency, the feel on my face when I went to put it on, but the one thing I could not understand was why it wouldn't soak into my skin! / When I would go to put makeup over it, my foundation would slip off, and wouldn't rub onto my face... I usually LOVE all of Loreal's products, so I am not giving up on this one... maybe I put too heavy of a layer of cream on my face... I will give it another shot using less cream!"
Best prices Excellent product.
For The Love Of Your Skin I really like this product. The only thing I don't like about it is the scent. I find it too strong. I personally like scent free skin care. Other then that I love how it feels on my skin
"Moisture To The Max! After using this product, I've noticed a firmer, smoother, more youthful appearance. My face has more volume, and feels bouncy to the touch. My slight nasal labial folds are completely smoothed out, and unnoticeable. My face is back to how it looked when I was in high school, boyish, moisturized, firm, voluminous, and line free! I LOVE this product, and would DEFINITELY be using it again!"
"Revitalift Triple Power Smells very nice.very thick and creamy,I liked it alot,Only down side it stung alittle bit first couplr times I used it,But it definatly kept me moistuized all day"
Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Moisturizer Luv the way it smelled and the way it goes on. Makes my skin feel soft
Nice Product Recently received samples of this product. I really don't see much of a difference so far. It does make my skin feel soft. This product does go a long way with a tiny amount.

"Switched From Neutrogena OK, so the only reason I tried this moisturizer was because it was a free sample. I have always used (and loved) Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair but no more. I now exclusively buy products in the Revitalift line. As soon as I started using my free sample, I noticed a change in my skin. My face looks more radiant and smooth - I am a sold on this product!

"I Love My Skin! I received a 2 week sample. Appreciated the quantity since I really got a fuller experience. My skin feels so much softer, forehead and mouth/lip wrinkles are less visable. Jawline is a bit firmer, too. Have received compliments from several people who see me frequently and have noticed the difference. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Love The Products! Helps My Dry Skin I love L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift facial moisturizer. It helped moisturizer my dry skin.

"Wonderfully Nourishing Moisturizer I loved the Triple-Power Facial Moisturizer from L'Oreal. It is thick and hydrating without feeling like it sits heavily on your face. At the same time, it's creamy and rich and does not leave my face dry. I also loved the fragrance of the moisturizer. At the end of the day, I felt like my face had been nourished and protected for the whole day and felt smooth when I washed my face at night. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This Stuff Is A Lifesaver! I have been using L'Oreal Paris' RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer for almost two weeks now and my skin has never felt better. I have naturally extremely dry and my job leeches every bit of moisture out of it. I've been applying the moisturizer every morning before work and at night before bed and the differences are astounding. I gave up on facial moisturizers years ago because they were far too greasy, but this Deep-Acting Moisturizer is perfect for me. My face is now softer and feels like new! I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Skin Feels Soft And Hydrated Invited to accept the Revitalift challenge and so happy that i did. Love the product, my skin felt so soft and hydrated. in a couple of day looked nice and with a healthy glow, diminished the fine lines. The scent is nice and fresh. Definitely will buy it.

"Great for combination skin with very dry patches This is one of the creams that works on skin that is dry despite exfoliation. I am 60 and active so I have good skin and this cream helps to keep it in good condition. I use retinol (that is one of the reasons my skin gets dry) but use this cream every other night. For me, it works well as a night cream. I take a warm shower after exercise, rinse with cold to close the pores, and this cream is still absorbed. I like the ingredients. I have seen articles that reccomend some of the ingredients, which were written by dermatologists, and the price is more reasonable than department store brands who sell less product for more money and may not, in some cases, be in touch with the science of skin. I recommend it to younger and older friends because it works! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Best Value Moisturizer... OK - nothing is magic and long before retirement I had a good income and bought expensive moisturizers (basically I wasted money!). I love this product for 1) appears to brighten 2) definitely hydrates and 3) value for money. I am going to purchase the other products in the lines (night and serum).

Skin Secret So satisfied. L'Oral brings high-end products to the mainstream. I did not tell anyone that I was using a new product. Within the first 7 days people were asking if I was trying something new. I had people asking if I had gotten a professional facial. The RevitaLift reduced appearance of pores and fine lines. It saturated my skin with moisture. The creme absorbed well and had a great scent. I am a forever fan. It is a permanent part of my skincare regimen now.

"L'oral Is Brilliant With This Triple Action Moisturizer! I have been using this product for a little over a week now, and it's simply brilliant. My skin is bright , less makeup being used, fine lines are lighter and harder to find. The smell of this product is light but wonderful. Moisturizer looks thick in jar, but is thin when applied and doesn't leave a greasy after look or feel. Simply leaves skin hydrated and brings great comments from people on how natural and un-flawed it makes my skin. Out of many jars of moisturizer I have tryed, this product is rated 1 for my skin. It's a must try product, you will love! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Final Report OMG...I've fallen in love with my L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment, and Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20! Just look at the decrease in my bags under my eyes and my wrinkles are disappearing. It's only been a few weeks and I'm seeing some dramatic positive results. I can't begin to recommend these products enough to anyone who wants to bring back a youthful complexion! Thanks L'Oreal for the confidence boost! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Must Have After the first day of a 5 step sample of Rivatalift Triple Powder Moisturizer, I purchased the full-size. That is a FIRST for me. I adore this product, it genuinely worked over night on my under eye bags and my skin felt so firm! This is a must-have for me and I will be repurchasing time and time again."
"Moisturizing Without Being Greasy I've only been using RevitaLift for about a week and I really didn't expect to notice any difference at all. I'm only just now beginning to see any signs of aging, so I didn't think a moisturizer could help something that we all get. I am surprised to say that yes, THIS moisturizer does in fact make a huge difference. The most obvious to me is when wearing makeup... Used to, I wore makeup to look older, more polished, but in the last couple of years it seems to make me look more haggard and well, older in a bad way. Since I've been using RevitaLift, I don't see all the fine lines and that hardness to my face. Even my mother in law wanted to know what I had changed because I looked softer and more vibrant. If that's not a reason to try it I don't know what is. The price is more than I usually spend, but a little goes a long way, and the results are worth a little extra to me.

"Effective Wrinkle Fighter Easy to apply, absorbs well. Could feel my skin tightened. Love the way my face feels after using."
Worked Well For Me I was unsure how it would take to my skin. It is vey sensitive to perfume creams etc. at first did it once a day incase of reaction hit third day started to use it twice a day just added into my routine. Shower face mask then after hat would apply the cream or lotion how you would like to put it. They sent me a 14 day trial to try it out. It made what few wrinkles I have go away. On my forehead I have had two deep wrinkles that seem to always stay. However the cream after about a week I noticed it went back to flat and I would even make faces and such to see if it would come back. So far it has not and I love it. If I go to wear makeup my skin is so smooth and it looks great now. I feel like I gained back about seven years of my youth. I do think it will get better as well continue to use it. I have now been thinking about applying it to other areas. Like my tummy a little bit. Try and see if it will tighten it up a slight bit. But a very good product. No acne problems eiher. Smooth thick elastic tight skin. Moist. It dry. Would suggest trying it out. Works wonders around the eyes as well. I put a nice extra bit around them seeing that it works good.

"Triple Power Indeed! First impressions: *The packaging is attractive and sleek. It will look nice on my counter. * Opening the Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer, I took a sniff. It has a pleasant, clean scent First use: *I applied the Deep-Acting Moisturizer. It has a somewhat thick consistency , so not much product was needed to fully moisturize my face and neck. This is non-greasy despite its consistency. Absorbed quickly and left my face feeling soft. Now, a little background on my skin. For the past couple of months, I have been experiencing extreme facial dryness and flaking, which greatly accentuated my fine lines to the point they looked like full wrinkles. I looked like I had aged 10 years in two months, and I am not exaggerating. I asked trusted people to be honest with me, and that I would not be offended, and they agreed that I looked like I had aged rapidly. It totally ruined my confidence and made me not want to leave the house. I tried many different lotions, but most just irritated my skin or only worked very temporarily. With this in mind, you can understand why I was so excited to try L'Oreal Revitalift Triple Repair Deep-Acting Moisturizer. I have used it twice daily for a week now, in the morning after my shower and at night before bed. The results Great! I was not expecting too much because of my chronic skin dryness, but my skin looks and feels better than it has in months! I've already regained a lot of confidence and am not ashamed to l have people look at my face. I appreciate that the lotion is not irritating and not greasy. My face feels so much softer now that I can't stop touching it (uh oh, I heard that can cause acne!). I look forward to seeing even more results in the future and I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to improve their skin! (Apologies for the blurry photo!)

"Loved It I got the samples in the mail, I tried the product and absolutely LOVE it ! Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try this ... it's now on my list of things to pick up at store This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love The Consistency I used this every morning and night for 14 days. Love the way it goes on. It's not too thin or watery like some of the other brands, and even though it goes on thick, it does not leave a greasy residue. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love It! I love it, its thick but not greasy and my face it's soft. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Excellent!!! I just used this product for the first time and it is phenomenal! I have been combating dry, flaky skin due to topical acne medicine. I have been using another product that is also good - but it wasn't good enough. I read numerous reviews all over, and this came up repeatedly. I took the plunge and bought it - best decision I have made in a long time! I am enormously pleased!! Highly recommend to everyone. At 23-ish, that was a little steep for me, but it is well worth it."
"Outstanding Product I received the 14 day sample and after one week have noticed a remarkable difference! Not greasy, pleasant scent and makes my skin feel and look great! A product that really does what it says!"

"Just Received This In The Mail I was skeptical at first but after trying it. I have fallen in love with it. I love the way it feels, not greedy or anything and I like that it protects your face from the UV rays . This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Impressed By This Moisturizer! I think this moisturizer has been the best by far that I have tried! I really enjoyed how it didn't make my face feel suffocated. I'm not one to use moisturizers on my face daily or often, but once I tried this and started to get into a routine, I was able to tell the difference on how it made my face feel. It didn't feel as dry and oily like it normally does. I really liked the scent too, it was not over powering and it feels light weight when you apply. I definitely recommend! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Loved It Great results very happy with the results after a short time period This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Smoothest Thing Iv Ever Put On My Face! First off Id like to thank LOral Paris for giving me a chance to try something I never would have thought to tried. I am like a skin care fanatic! But theres just so much different skin care products out there- its impossible to try all of them. But more brands should definitely do what you guys have done and reached out to consumers and give them a chance to TRY the product before they go and spend a good amount of money on something they have no clue will work for them. Now that Ive gotten the chance to try your product I loved it and I will definitely buy it in the future so Thank You! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I scream when I look into the Mirror I scream when I look into the Mirror now. This product rashes up my face and neck. I itch non-stop for days. My cheeks were red and bumpy.
"Amazing Moisturizer! This L'Oral deep-acting moisturizer lives up to the hype! It is moisturizing without being too greasy and works well under makeup and especially in the evening. I put the serum underneath for some extra umph and I love it. My skin feel plumped, refreshed and nourished. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love! I received a 14 day sample kit and I am in love! My skin feels smoother, dark circles have lessened and I feel like I look younger! I am in my 40's but have always suffered with deep dark circles under my eyes and uneven skin tones. Revitalift has helped with all of those things and more! It smells nice and goes on really smooth. Makes my hands soft as well! Will definitely be purchasing this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Pleased! I received a free 14 day trail. I really like it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"What A Feeling! Even after one day, I can see and feel a difference. Looking forward to results at day 14. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Amazing!!! I've been using this for a month now and I absolutely love this product. It's not greasy like other facial lotions on the market. My face is a lot softer then it was before I started using this moisturizer. The best part of all is that my face is really hydrated which really makes a difference in my skin's appearance. I have already recommend this to my mom. So far she's been using it for a few weeks now and is in love with it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I'm Sold On Revtalift I did the 14 day challenge. I got my product a week late so I'm only on day 7 but I see a change for the better. I've used a lot of different products and this does what it says. It's not plastic surgery but for a bottle of face cream it's worth the price This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great Product Just after a few days I noticed how soft and smooth my face felt. The results I saw after 14 days of usuage was enough to want to run out and buy Revitalift!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Extraordinary!! I received my samples about 1 week ago. Let me just say how pleasantly surprised I am by the visible differences in my skin. My complexion is much brighter, and age spots and fine lines are quite visibly reduced. This is my new go to moisturizer and I'm telling all my friends about it."
Absolutely Love This Product! I ended up receiving a 14 day trial challenge. I LOVE this product. I am only on day 5 of the challenge but I can see a huge difference in my face. It looks and feels smoother and has more hydration . I wpuld recommend this product to friends and family! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love This! I started using this about a week ago and I can honestly say I love it! It has a beautiful clean smell and when I put it on it actually feels like silky and not thin and watery. From the very first time you put it on your face flows with this dewy, pretty complexion. I've only used it a week so I can't say much about wrinkles yet but I already know I won't be dissapointed! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
would have liked to have used it longer Still too early to tell but I like how soft it makes my skin. Hoping it gets rid of my dry skin and rash. Dermatologist highly recommended it.
Amazing Results! I'm only about a week into my Revitalift challenge and already I am seeing the results. Even my granddaughter commented on my skin. Excellent product! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Miracle Cream I didn't the 14 day challenge and my skin has never looked better. My face is so soft, radiant, smooth, and firmer. I love this cream and can't imagined my life without it now. A must try!!! You This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Try You Will Like I really liked this product and will be purchasing it. I like the cream density and saw that it was absorbed rather quickly. You do really see results after continued use. Try for yourself and see. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Liked It! I received 14 day sample of this cream and I like it. It's a nice moisturizer, skin seems to be firmer, has fragrance but it dissipates, haven't noticed a huge difference in wrinkles yet, but will keep using it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Wonderful Product! I tried out the 14 day sample packet they sent me and I was happy I tried it out! One thing I will point out right away is that I always seem to have best results when I apply it at night after washing my face. The scent is amazing! Its a very fresh floral scent so if youre not a fan of scented products on your face, you might not like this. Other than that, its the only negative I can really think of. I have kind of oily skin and dries out quite a bit in the winter and fall months. This makes my skin feel very moisturized and not greasy at all so it doesnt feel like its clogging my pores like other products seem to do. So far its been about a week and a half and I feel like theres more elasticity and it feels like theres more plumpness to it. All in all, its worth a try! I will be buying more! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
The Best Moisturizer I Have Ever Used I have used the samples for 14 days and have the most improvement on my skin ever! This is so fantastic and feels so wonderful. It works almost immediately and you can feel positive lift every day that you apply it. I have already bought a full size container so I may continue to use this every morning and every night. Thank you L'Oreal for a fabulous moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Fresh Look I tried the 14 days sample packs and I love it. My face feels so much smoother and a fresh looking, yes I would recommend it to anyone."
"Gave Me Confidence First I would like to start by saying this is my first review ever written. I wanted an moisturizer, I didn't know what to get, so I ended up getting Oil Of Olay. My Mother used it so i thought it must be good. I never, never noticed a difference but keep using it. Now I have tried the REVITALIFT --and I am in LOVE! My skin is o smooth, lines are leaving--(bye bye!) and most important, my face and neck are firm. I turned 40 and haven't been happy about getting old, and with not so nice skin,but REVITALIFT is givening me a whole new confidence, and I needed it. So if anyone out there is thinking of trying it, go for it. I really think you'll love this product just as much as myself. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Amazing I tried the 14 day challenge and the results were amazing. My friend noticed a change in my face and she had no clue I was doing the 14 day challenge! My face feels great. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Awesome Product It really helps to keep you moisturized plus it does a good job at helping those fine lines that start forming great product, will definately buy this!"
CerVe My husband's dermatologist recommended this product we've been using it for some time on his dry skin. It works very well.
Nice And Light I took the 14 day challenge and can see a clear difference in my skin. This stuff is amazing! I love how light it goes on. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Awesome!! Absolutely loved this product! Fragrance was wonderful and it went onto my skin smoothly. Not oily and hydrated my skin completly. I actually think it firmed up the skin around my eyes. Which was beginning to be a problem area. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great Feel very smooth, non-greasy"
"Works Great I tried the Revitalift challenge and although I still have a couple of more days to go,I noticed the change after about 5 days. The lines on my forehead and around my mouth have improved and my skin feels tighter. Definitely works! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Revitalift Triple Power Moisturizer Fast, effective, leaves skin feeling satiny smooth. Applied makeup over this moisturizer and noticed how much easier it was to blend. RevitaLift works better than the higher priced department store moisturizer I've used for over 15 years. I've changed brands...never thoght it would happen. Thank you for the opportunity to test this product."
"Revitalift Is Amazing!!! I absolutely love this product! I've been using this line for about 3 weeks and the results are awesome! I noticed immediately after my first use how soft it made my skin feel, it's non greasy and absorbs very quickly. The smell may be a tad bit strong for some but I love it. It's very citrusy, kind of reminds me of fresh grapefruit. I use this twice a day and I have 24hr softness. The lines around my mouth have started to fade. My dark spots and blemishes aren't so noticeable now either. Overall I love this product and would recommend it to anyone looking to combat the early signs of aging. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love This Product! I have dry sentive skin and this moisturizer made a difference from day 1- My skin feels soft supple and appears brighter with a more even tone it lessens the appearance of fine line and give my skin a plump, youthful look. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Awesome Product I love the way these products are starting to feel on my face! It took awhile to notice a difference, but I am definitely seeing it! Less wrinkles, and less lines in my face. Definitely has improved the overall appearance of my skin tone, too! Like anything, it takes time to notice a difference. You can't try it once, and expect results. It's been nearly two weeks, and I'm finally seeing some results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Really Saw A Difference With This Revitalift I received this product for a 15 day trial. I used the product as instructed and enjoyed the smell and feel of the cream. It makes my skin feel great! Not oily. I started noticing my neck wrinkles are less apparent than before using the product. I also used it on my face and ear lobes. I like the product and will purchase it soon. I would definitely recommend it to friends and family. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"It Surprised Me When I first put on the deep moisturizer, it felt greasy to me. I thought that it was never going to absorb into my face, but within about a minute, I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did it completely absorb, it left my skin feeling soft. Even 2 hours after applying it, my skin feels soft and full of moisture. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great skin care... This product was recommended by my dermatologist and I must say I'm so glad she did! I was given a sample and from the first application, I saw results. I couldn't find the cream in the store or pharmacy in my area so I ordered it online and did fast deliverly. It has been more effective than many of the prescriptions I have received in the past. I'm so satisfied with the results and would recommend this product to anyone who has extremely dry skin because it left my skin feeling baby soft and smooth!"
"Luxuriously Silky Smooth I only recently received and started using this moisturizer and already see results! It is very concentrated and rich, so you only need to use a small amount after applying the serum each evening before bed. It doesn't feel greasy or too thick, and it has a very feminine, light fragrance. I am a 61 year old female with some sun damage from my sun-worshiping days, but already my skin is looking more hydrated and an almost youthful glow. My husband (who usually doesn't notice anything!!) remarked that my complexion looked great! I am DEFINITELY sold on this series of products!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
So Moisturizing! I received a 14 day sample. Within a week I noticed a difference with my skin. It's very rich and creamy. Loved it! This review was collected as part of a promotion.

L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Serum And Moisturizer My skin felt so soft after using L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Triple Concentrated Facial Serum and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer. This will be my new regiment. I just started using and I really love how my skin feels. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Amazing! So glad I tried the free sample! amazing product!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great Moisturizer So far I'm really enjoying this moisturizer. I'm on day 10 of the 14 day challenge. From day 1 I've noticed that my skin is more soft and vibrant looking. I've been using this moisturzer in the morning and at night before bed. I've noticed that after a few days of using this moisturizer that it has started to flake on my skin almost immediately after application. It's not a complete deal breaker for me though because I absolutely love the way it makes my skin feel, I think I'll just start using it solely at night before bed. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Fabulous Softness I received y 15 day trial and at the halfway point my skin was so Soft. At the day 11 I was out and ran into some old friends and the nicest things they could say was, my skin was glowing and fabulous softness. I will be buying this."
"Light And Airy. I received this product for free in return for an honest review. Bottom line, I really like this product. Let me tell you why. First, the jar it comes in is glass, not plastic, very, very nice. Easy to open and replace the cap. Light, airy, not greasy and blends in very easily. Even on hot days (I used this for 2 weeks in late June/early July), my face never felt weighed down or greasy or oily. Very little scent, but what scent there is, it is nice and light. A little goes a long way so I believe this jar will last a long time. I am 90 sure I will buy L'oreal Revitalift when I need a new jar."
Great Results I used the Triple Power Serum and Moisturizer together with great results. They both absorb into the skin and are not greasy at all. I saw immediate moisture restoral and over a month's time actually saw more firmness and softening of the wrinkles around my eyes. Love these products.
"L'oreal Paris Revitalift Cream The L'Oreal Revitalift Cream is such a wonderful product. It is very easy to apply. You dip your finger in the cream and apply with fingers on face and neck. Immediately, the face feels soft and smooth. After a couple hours, my face looks clean, bright, and refreshed. It even felt soft. For me, it is really hard finding a perfect face cream that doesn't harm my sensitive skin. This product has really improved the quality of my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"CeraVe Renewing SA Cream I have been using this product for a few years now, it was recommended to me by my dermatologist. My skin is very dry and scaly patches and bumps form on my lower arms and legs. This is the best cream I have found that will keep my skin moist and removes all the dead skin that forms. I also use two other CeraVe products, the moisturizing cream and the renewing lotion. The moisturizer I use on the remaining parts of my body and the lotion on my face. I would highly recommend these products to people with dry skin, especially older women like me."
"Triple Power Healthy Skin I have a very pale complexion with extremely sensitive skin which leans towards the oily side. Finding products for my skin has been a difficult and expensive process. The cream is thick and smooth with quick absorption into the skin. I would apply the L'Oreals RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment before applying the moisturizer. After using the both products together for just a few days I noticed that my skin felt drastically smoother and softer to the touch. I am usually prone to break-outs when using new products, but this product did not cause any problems. In addition, there was a more even tone to my skin with a healthy glow that I didnt expect. The only downside is that it has a very strong fragrance (especially if you have allergies or are highly sensitivity to fragrances). Overall, I would say this is a great product if you want to replenish, revitalize and keep skin looking healthy! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"I'm Shocked At How Much I Love This Product! I have very oily and acne prone skin. Moisturizers scare me! The first thing I noticed is how pretty the tub of moisturizer is, my favorite color is purple, the second is how nice it smells. I was really surprised at how quickly my skin seemed to drink the moisturizer in which is very uncommon for my skin. I applied the moisturizer after the serum from the same line from L'Oreal and go to bed with lovely scented soft skin. To top it all off, not only did my skin not break out it cleared up! I will continue to use this every night. I have always loved L'Oreal and had just run out of my Youth Code night cream and now I'll be using the RevitaLift. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Makes Me Look Younger This moisturizer is great. The first night I wore it I woke up in the morning and my face looked so good my skin looked diffrent. I was glowing. I put it on my face and neck each and every night and it has made a difference.
"Love Love Love I am one who is an avid consumer if shiseido. That is extremely expensive facial care products. After my first 30 seconds of using this, I fell in love with the scent, the texture and how exactly wonderful my skin felt. That means alot This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Lucy Sinker I recieved a sample 3 weeks ago. This is the best cream I have used so far. It made my skin look so smooth and felt smooth too. The frown lines I have have diminished so much. Along with the laugh lines I hated so much, they looked like the grand canyon. But now they are so much fuller and smoother. thank you loreal. I will definetly continue to use. I reccommend this to anyone that has fine lines or noticable lines, it really works."
"Two For One! The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is two wonderful products in one. Living in the humid Gulf Coast with oily skin, it has always been a challenge for me to find a product that truly moisturizes and balances my skin without the weight of a heavy cream. This stuff does the trick! It absorbs quickly into the skin giving you a smooth hydrated surface for applying makeup without it settling into fine lines or wrinkles. The overall tone and texture of my skin has improved. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Face Product I think this L'Oreal Revitalift Deep Moisturizer is a great product. It helps reduce wrinkles. I never thought I had that many wrinkles until trying this product because now I can see a big difference in my face. I always swore that moisturizers like this that helps wrinkles never really work but I will no longer say that. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"For Men Too! When I received my Triple products in L'Ore,al Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment,L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF, my husband wanted to know what it was and what it was for. So I told him it smoothed out the skin, evened out the skin tones, helped with fine lines and wrinkles. He was like I want to try! So after a week, he said that he could see a difference, that the lines on his forehead were smaller and he really loved this! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'oreal Revitalift I am using all 3 products and it has been just 2+ weeks. I use the twice a day and am noticing a difference. My skin seems softer. A dark spot is definitely lightening up. I will definitely continue with these products, as I feel my skin looks better already This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Dermatologist recommended and very effective I talked to my dermatologist about the roughness of the skin on the back of my upper arms, which had also become a problem on my legs, including reddish bumps. He told me to use this cream once a day. It took several weeks to see any effects, but I now have perfectly smooth skin in those problematic areas. I am very pleased with the effectiveness of this product, I know that the rough upper arm area is a problem for a lot of women, and I hope that word gets around that this cream solves that problem."

"Excellent for dry skin Suggested by my Dermatologist. It is excellent for dry skin. I am a senior and many years of sun have dried my skin and this is the best of all the lotions and potions Rx and OTC that I have used. Some have been like a paste that would not spread and others were useless. This really does the trick. A little more expensive than the regular CeraVe but I use less, it goes farther, and works like a charm. It's not greasy and goes in well."

I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to maintain or improve their youthful appearance. Best product e ever had!!!!"
Great Results I used the Triple Power Serum and Moisturizer together with great results. They both absorb into the skin and are not greasy at all. I saw immediate moisture restoral and over a month's time actually saw more firmness and softening of the wrinkles around my eyes. Love these products.
"It's so creamy! I really like the RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and will be purchasing it. It seems to be making my aging skin a little firmer and I love the scent! And it feels good on my sensitive skin. A little goes a long way, too. Thank you for making such a wonderful product."
"65th Birthday gift! I will be 65 in a few days..and I received the best gift from Revitalift! I have bought very expensive creams with just minor results. I received the 5 day test and what a change! It's hard to correct 65 years of damage, but This did just great. I'm out today to buy my supply."
"This really works my skin doc recommended this over a year ago , I bought some around 6 months ago . this really helps my dry skin , my hands get so bad some fabrics like silk catch on my hands , and I hate that feeling after applying this lotion silk does not catch on my hands , it runs threw them like my skin is baby soft ! to me that's a miracle ! I have major allergies to lotions , laundry soaps , bath soaps , my skin gets so dry it cracks . then I have to use an ointment and bandaids , but once the crack heals to where it is not bleeding I appy this all day and at night , and it has my hands soft by morning ."
"Excellent Moisturizer! The results of Revitalift Triple Power were noticable very quickly after I began using it. Using in the morning and evening my skin was much softer and refined.Revitalift also has a very plesant scent that is not over powering, I will continue using for my moisturizing needs."
"It does lift your skin I really didn't expect much, but I was really very pleasantly surprised. I used some on my eyelids, and they tightened up and lifted making me look younger. Thanks. Can't afford plastic surgery, and I'm so glad to find this works for me. No irritation of the skin either."
Not all moisturizers are the same A few weeks ago I received a sample of RevitaLift. I've used it every day since then and there is a noticable improvement in my complextion. My skin is tighter and smoother. Now I know not all moisturizers are the same and I will only buy RevitaLift in the future.
"Started working right away I live in a very dry climate, and my skin feels dry much of the time. Just after using RevitaLife Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer for the first couple of days, I could feel a huge difference in my facial skin. It felt revitalized and refreshed. Great product!"
"Truly Deep-Acting! I tried this product for the first time, and have been using it daily. I believe I have seen a visible difference in my skin - the thin areas seem plumper, and my face actually looks better hydrated. I intend to purchase it, switching from my present moisturizer."
youth fountain in a bottle I just love this product it not only makes my face and neck soft younger looking but one day I had a little more product on my fingers than I needed and didnt want to waste it so I rubbed it onto the top of my hands and wow my hands look fantastic and feeel soft
My skin feels great! I am always weary of anti-aging moisurizers. This one is exceptional! I saw smoother more hydrated skin in the first 2 days. I also didn't have any kind of breakout as a result. That is usually why I don't use a moisturizer. Also it has a great price retail!!
"Skin feels sooooo good! THis prodauct is wonderful for the price! I don't believe you could ever find a product that works as well as this for this price! I love the way it made my skin feel, so soft and smooth. If you try this peoduct I believe you will love it as much as I do!"
The Best Deep-Acting Moisturizer! I use this product morning and nite. You only need a small amount and it makes you feel like you have done something very important for your skin. I have been using just over a month and I do see a visible differnce in my skin's texture and appearance.
"My face feels wonderful!! After using this product the first day I felt a very positive change! My face has been smoother and soft to touch. More imporvements were made with every day of use. I have had no braeak outs, redness, or dryness!! I would highly recommend this product!"
"My doctor recommended this product! Thank you! My doctor recommended I purchase this for my extremely dry skin. I have tried several products in the past but I have allergies to products and with my Excema it was hard to find a product that I could use and would work. The cream is better then the lotion. The cream is so creamy. It feels instantly good on your skin. It doesn't bother my excema when I put it on, which is amazing because that was a big problem. It doesn't have harsh chemicals in it. I live in the desert and My skin was so very dry. This cream is a lifesaver."
al you need in one jar This product is amazing! You will see results in 2 days. It goes on smoothly and is not greasy. My husband complemented me on how my face looks more youthful and bright. The fine lines around my eyes are less visibile. It does what it says it will.
"Just love this moisturizer! I have used other moisturizers in the past. But, I just love this moisturizer within weeks of using this product. My wrinkles had softened and I could notice visible firmness to my face. I will be purchasing this product from this day forward."
makes my skin feel hydrated all day Before I started using the RevitaLift Triple Power Moisturizer my make up started to crumble on my cheeks and look greasy on my t-zone after a while. Now my face seems to be more evenend out and it seems to retain the moisture in my skin.
Fantastic Love L'Oreal this product especially. Works wonderfully not greasy i like that it has the Hylauronic acid too. Great product! great price!
"Got rid of neck wrinkles!! I was a little sceptical at first, but after using it twice those little wrinkles on my throat under my chin are gone! So exciting! I've tried several other moisturizers, but none got rid of these wrinkles! I love how it feels going on"
eliminating peri menoposal dry patches Before I began using RevitaLift Triple Power I was experiencing dry patches around my mouth for the first time in my life. This product has been a great addition to my beauty routine and I recomend it to anyone with maturing skin.
Great Product Thank you for the samples. I loved it. It is one of the best Moisturizers I have tried. It made my skin feel so smooth. I am 69 years old so naturally I have wrinkles but I feel the moisturizer will revitalize my skin. Thank you again.
"Astonshing Reults This product really works , from the first time that you apply you can see and feel the results of your skin . I will swtich my current product for the Revitalift Triple Power works very well for my aging skin 49 years old ."
"A Redhead's fair skin looks like a million bucks! Being a Redhead with fair skin, it has a tendency to dry out. I've tried other products, even Oil of Olay, it made my skin drier. Not L'Oreal's RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer, it made my dry skin dewy and soft!"
"Great Skincare Even though I only tried a sample of it, I noticed a difference. I used it at night right before I went to sleep. When I woke up in the morning, my face still felt really soft and smooth and I didn't have any new breakouts."
"Actually seems to work. My Mom uses this on her legs. She is diabetic and has extreme varicose veins. Her legs get extremely dry and seem to swell a lot more when they get dry. She's started putting this on them and they look SO MUCH better, and don't seem to swell so much. I also use it and it seems to really make a difference, and works better than other things I've used. I'm sticking with it."
"Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer This product was easy to apply, felt wonderful, and I believe I could actual see a difference in the look of fine wrinkles after use of this product for one week. This product was gentle to my skin, and felt very expensive."
Revitalift I have been using Revitalift products for about 10 months now and I really like it. This RevitaLift Triple Power is very nice. Feels good and adds more moisture than the non triple power. Would definitely recommend to anyone
"Love this! I am loving the Loreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer. It keeps my face feeling, well moisturized during the day and I beleive it has made my skin to look younger looking also. I am in love with this."
"I was really surprised I'm 56 and have worked in the cosmetic business and have used some of the most expensive products out there. I was really surprised to actually SEE a difference within 2 days. Like the other review here, I sleep on my side"
"Love the Lift! I found the RevitaLift Triple Power Moisturizer absolutely fantastic! I am 58 and am often told I look 46! I could see a noticeable difference after just 2 usages. I will be a loyal user. Love, love, LOVE this product!"
"Smooth feeling skin I just love the way this product makes my skin feel.It has a great scent too not over powering.I love the creamy feel of the lotion.I use it every night before I go to bed,and when I get up.It's a great product!"
"GREAT MOISTURIZER I love this moisturizer,i didnt break out in acne.It has a great scent plus when you apply it leaves your skin feeling very soft and silky and its not greasy at all ,a little dab goes a long way. Great product."
"best moisturizer I ever used, compares the best! I really love the thick, and creamy moisturizer! I used many other including olay! I believe I was won over buy this cream! I will buy it and recommend it to my friends! Thank you Loreal! Your team is genious!!"
"Great Product!! I loved the immediate feeling of moisturized, soft skin. I haven't used it for very long..just a week or so, but I plan on purchasing this and see if I can get some of the fine wrinkles/lines back to the past!"
"Wonderful moisturizer So glad I had the chance to try this product. I'm starting to get some fine lines under the corners of my mouth...probably from smiling so much LOL. Anyway, this product seems to help and minimizes the lines."
Good stuff! I tend to have chicken skin and this stuff really helps keep it looking and feeling normal. Kinda pricey but worth every penny to be able to wear short sleeves and not be self conscious.
TRIPLE POWER The best moisturizer I ever had leaves my skin soft looking hydrated and younger looking!! I have gotten so many compliments on my skin. THANK YOU L'OREAL TRIPLE POWER...deep acting moisturizer!!!!
"I love this stuff! I've been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks now, and I love it! Within the first few days my skin looked more youthful. I have combination skin, and my face feels so soft but not greasy."
Nourishes thirsty skin I have always used Loreal eye and face creams. The triple power moisturizer seemed more potent and I know my skin was softer. It is a good value and coupons make it an affordable daily necessity.
Very smooth Nice scent! Makes skin feel smooth. I have very sensitive skin and it was not irritating. A little goes a long way. Moisturizer is very light...never know it's been applied.
Love this moisturizer I received this moisturizer and have loved it. It goes on nice and makes my fine lines dissappear. My face is very smooth and soft. The moisturizer seems to stay on all day.
Feels Wonderful! I love the feel of this moisturizer. It feels great on my fingers and sinks in leaving a nice feel on my face. The moisture lasts without feeling greasy. It is just soft.
Incredible Moisturizer! I am very impressed with this product. My facial skin has never seen felt better. RevitaLift feels like a silky coating when applied. I would definitely recommend it!
Works as advertised! This product definitely lives up to its promise. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. My skin felt smoother and I also liked that the scent was mild.
"silky smooth skin I really enjoyed using this moisturizer. I live in AZ so I really need a good product for dry skin. This left my skin silky, smooth but was not heavy on my skin."
I love it! I have always loved Loreal products and this one is no different. This is probably the best moisurizer that I have ever used. I will definitely be buying this again.
"Great Dry Skin Cream This product was recommended to me for my dry skin, especially during the Winter. I have been using it on my arms for two weeks now, and the dry patches have disappeared. It goes on easily and leaves the skin soft. I would not recommend it for facial use, as I tried that and had to wash it off because it stung my sensitive skin."
Love Revitalift Triple Power I tried the samples and love the way it made my skin feel. I am also noticing a change in my skin. I love this product and look forward to coupons in the future.
Great Product! This felt so good on my face. I love the way it made my skin feel so soft. It was smooth and easy to apply. I loved it! I went right out and bought myself a bottle
Max Moisture! I loved everything abour the Revitalift Triple Power. My skin was hydrated - it smells wonderful and I noticed in the 5 days that sun spots were lightening up!
"Delivers all day moisture From morning till evening this moisturizer delivers long lasting results. With daily use, I have found my skin to be softer and the fine lines have decreased."
"Moisturizing dream This product truely does a great job on my skin! It's a great moisturizer and keeps my skin soft all day, even on those days when I work out in the cold wind."
Makes my skin soft and smooth Makes my fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes less noticable soft and light on my skin not greasy or heavy excellent product makes me feel young again!
I love this! So I may not be the target age for this product (I'm 24) but I love it! My skin feels so soft and moisturized. It also didn't break out my acne prone skin.
Love this moisturiser I was looking for a penetrating moisturiser and L'Oreal came up with this deep-acting moisturiser..I liked the way it made my skin feel and the light scent. I like the results I acheived also.
"Amazing! I am 37 and have tried so many moisurizers,and yet my face still felt dry. I started using Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and was amazed and won't use anything else now."
"My skin looks much Healthier I have used MANY products that claim to make wrinkles look dimished, to make skin look brighter but NEVER do any of that. This product DOES! I call it my Fountain of youth in a bottle."
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!! I have extremely dry skin and i have used a wide range of products in the past but the result was either a greasy finish or not moisturizing enough. I really wish i had known about this cream sooner. This product gives a new definition to moisturizing!!! I noticed a significant difference the first day i used it !!! My skin felt much softer and smoother and had a really nice glow. I have eczema and very sensitive skin and this cream did not aggravate it at all. Would highly recommend buying it.
Great lifting Cream The new Tripel Power Lift is great for the neck and throat. Was using the Double lift before and really like the results of the Triple Lift. I can feel it working as soon as I put it on.
"Really rehydrated my skin I tried RevitaLift Triple Power Moisturizer for 5 days, and it really helped to make my skin look and feel more youthful. I am definitely planning to buy. Thank you for the sample."
"Love This Product It doesn't seem like giving a product only 5 days to prove itself would be enough, but within 3 days I knew this was a product that would become a part of my daily facial routine."
"Great fragance and moisturizer! Product is smooth and creamy. Goes on easily and soaks in properly. Provides moisturizer relief deep into the skin. Has a wonderful fragrance, not overpowering. Highly recommend."
Softer Skin like never before This Moisturizer is so awesome. My skin felt so soft and moisturized like never before and felt soft for a longer period. With regular application even the fine lines disappear.
"My face feels fantastic! This product is great ! It smells wonderful and makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated. It does not feel heavy or greasy . Also, my makeup goes on smoothly. Thank you Loreal."
Excellent Excellent
Gives me the skin I always wanted! I love this cream! My pores virtually disappear!
"Lucy Sinker I recieved a sample 3 weeks ago. This is the best cream I have used so far. It made my skin look so smooth and felt smooth too. The frown lines I have have diminished so much. Along with the laugh lines I hated so much, they looked like the grand canyon. But now they are so much fuller and smoother. thank you loreal. I will definetly continue to use. I reccommend this to anyone that has fine lines or noticable lines, it really works."
Revitalift works great! I recieved a sample of revitalift which i was happy to try. I loved the somewhat thicker texture of the cream. It was not greasy at all and absorbed quickly which i love! Smell was nice but not too overpowering and didn't linger for long. I love to have a light non greasy and clean feeling after using a face cream and this did it! Now time will tell on the softening of wrinkles and tightning of the skin but im willing to try.
Does the job One of the best moisturizers I've ever used. It made my skin soft without a greasy feeling. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Works as advertised This was the only cream that made a significant change to my dry skin condition. Cerave SA Cream really works!!!! My eczema is better controlled with this product. An excellent product indeed. I recommend purchasing it online and picking it up at the store as it will be a few dollars cheaper that way.
I LOVE this stuff I'm 43 and slowly losing elasticity in my skin and my face looks tired. I used the moisturizer for 7 days to see if this one was any different than any of the others I've tried. I saw results within 3 days. The moisturizer itself is great and the firmness of my skin had shown visable signs of improvement. I will continue to use this product and recommend it to anyone my age who is tired of all the next best products.
"Love it and omg THank you!!!!!! I wasas shocked to receive a huge beautiful jar of revitalift in the mail shortly after new years day 1/2/13. I was out of all my products. I love anything L'oreal makes and also, only use their paris hair dye. This product is thick enough you only need a lil each use, I am 47, 48 in april :( , lol and have no wrinlke's. It's a mystery who sent me this huge beautiful jar, but thank you for awesome products of every kind."
"smooth and silky! I have been using it for two weeks. I really like how my skin feels. I also notice that it seems to be minimizing my wrinkles somewhat. The fragrance is nice, and not overpowering like some other brands. It's not greasy and soaks in nicely. Now that I have tried it for free, I plan on purchasing it when I run out of it. Thank you for the opportunity to try it! I am very pleased with your product! I highly recommend it!"
Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer Free Samples I absolutely loved this product and plan to keep using it. I love the way that it glides on and is absorbed without the heavy feel or alcohol burn of some moisturizers. The texture of my face feels like velvet and my skin feels nourished instead of dry and tight. Thank you for 5 days of this product so that I could get a comprehensive understanding of the difference between the good stuff and what I had been using.
I loved RevitaLift!! I was really impressed with the results I got from RevitaLift. I started using it the first day and was amazed at the really thick and creamy texture. It melted right into my skin. My face felt great right away and throughout the rest of the day. I was looking forward to putting it on the second day and was not disappointed. My skin looks much more even toned and tight after the 14 days. I'm hooked for life!!
"Satisfying results within a few days I rarely take the time to write a review, but I feel so satisfied with this product I just had to write to say Thank you! I was so pleased to have received enough samples of this product to give me a chance to really see if I like it or not. After several days I knew it was the moisturizer I've been looking for. I have purchased my first jar. At 61 yrs old and I can look in the mirror and smile."
"Exceptional moisturizer In the winter, My skin on my face is so dry and cracked. Using make up everyday only makes the situation worse. My face is so tight and itchy during the winter, It's just down right uncomfortable. Since I recieved the RevitaLift, my skin is less irratated. It feels normal and doesn't look dry at all. In fact I went skiing today with my face exposed all day and it felt smooth and fresh, not dry"
"Love RevitaLift - am seeing the difference!! I have been using for about 3 weeks. My face is healthier and less dry, and wrinkles are definitely fading. I use it at night after cleaning and when I wake up, my face feels wonderful. Especially during the cold months, when my skin is especially dry. My makeup goes on so smoothly now, and I am now having acne breakouts either. This moisturizer is working great with my skin! I love it!!!"
"One of the best moisturizers Well,it is winter here in Maine and I deffinately needed a better moisturizer! I got my 5 day sample at just the right tiime!I have to use a really good moisturizer in the winter and this worked EXTREMELY well!!I loved the way it made my face and neck feel soooo good ALL through the day and didn't make it feel like an oil slick!!!It even made my makeup look alot more natural!!"
"Best product ever! One of the best I've ever used. And I've used the expense stuff before, but the results weren't noticeable . I also use the overnight intensive mask , the results are incredible. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to reduce wrinkles, firm skin and brighten you complexion. I will never use anything else. Love it!"
It works This took the bumps on my arms away .Also it stops my awfu! Itching of dry skin.
Wrinkles be gone WalmartBeauty I received this product in my Walmart Beauty Box and I love it. I instantly could see that it helps with wrinkles. I am keeping my fingers crossed on helping with sagging skin. Sounds terrible...and that is why I am using it. Very thick cream and a little dab will cover a big area.
"Awesome Moisturizer I tried ReviatLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and I was thrilled with the results. It seemed to decrease my laugh lines. I loved the scent, and how easily it was absorbed by my skin. It didn't feel greasy or leave my skin oily. It's an excellent product! Although it is an excellent product, I can't afford to purchase it. It's very expensive for my budget."
"Love it! but if you have oily skin... I love this moisturizer, it's rich and a little dab goes a long way. On my first week it helped with my acne ( as long as I washed my face twice a day and applied the moisturizer) but eventually my skin started to get too oily, so I used it only at night still getting great results. I'm 28, so wrinkles are not much of a problem to me right now but I did see a big improvment on my skin. I would def. recommend this moisturizer but if you have oily skin or combination like mine, go easy with it."
"Actually works! I was fortunate to be able to try a sample of the product and with how frugal I am, I have to say that I will actually be looking for and buying this product. I am in my mid-40's and I live in Texas. The weather is insane and I am very fair skinned with sensitive combination skin...so I always need a moisturizer and one that won't make me break out or look like an oil spill. I was pleasantly surprised that it absorbed well, no horrid scent, and my face looked refreshed-not greasy. Happy me!"
"Great Used As A Night/Day Cream I'm in LOVE! Not too many things excite me more than a great moisturizer! L'oreal Paris Triple Power DEEP-ACTING MOISTURIZER has done just that for me! I'm clearing out my vanity drawer of unusable, non effective, so called moisturuzers and keeping my vanity stocked with L'oreal Paris Triple Power DEEP-ACTING MOISTURIZER. I've used it for both day AND night moisturizing but, becausd of the rich creamy formula, I've decided to use it specifically for night. The formula is so rich and creamy, absorbs into my skin effortlessly and leaves my skin feeling richly hydrated and healthy! I'm an ingredient reader! Hands down, the boxes are always turned and rolled around until every word iz read. I did just that with this L'oreal Paris Triple Power DEEP-ACTING MOISTURUZER. The formula repairs wrinkles, re-firms skin, and redensify your skin. Thats everything my aging skin needs. This formula has hyaluronic acid which helps hydrate your skin to make your skin plump with moisture and help retain water under your skins layers preventing a dehydrated, dry look and feel. Also, this rich creamy formula contains PRO-XYLANE. L'oreal Paris laboratories developed this formula to help repair and fight the appearance of age spots accosiated with sun exposure. Harmful UVA/UVB rays. I cleanse my face and neck each night and apply a generous amount of L'oreal Paris Triple Power DEEP-ACTING MOISTURIZER. Applying a generous amount absorbs 100 into my skin. Making me feel like my skin will stay hydrated, nourished and stay healthy without me feeling like I'm wearing a mask. For this formula to be as thick and rich as it is, and not have a heavy feeling on my face during the night is a PLUS in my book. L'orealParis Triple Power DEEP-ACTING MOISTURIZER is another, I'M SO WORTH IT products that I can recommend this product to women of all ages and skin types. For young skin and maturing skin, you can use it for day and use it for night time moisturizing. L'oreal Paris has made this innovative lightweight formula perfect for using it day AND night. I used it for both day and night at first but, found I prefer using it as a night time moisturizer. You should buy it also because, YOU ARE WORTH IT Thank you L'orealParis for allowing me to try your L'oreal Paris Triple Power DEEP-ACTING MOIZTURIZER. I'm going to continue using this great products as its delivering results I am noticing. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loved! I am a moisturizing fanatic and have used many different mositurizers in the past. Loreal sent me five days worth of their RevitaLift Triple Power samples. First off, it was thick which I loved. It went on smoothly and gave off a slight cooling sensation. Throughout the morning I could smell the fresh clean scent of the moisturizer. It was not overpowering but just strong enough that I would get a pleasant whiff of it every now and then. Even after a few days, I felt my skin was tighter."
"Long-lasting! Great for dry skin! You can feel the difference after first application. My skin feels silky soft and hydrated. I use it in the morning before putting my make-up on and the effect can last the whole day. You only need a thin coat otherwise it will tend to clump when combined with foundation or other products. I still love it though and plan of using it as part of my daily skincare routine for a long period of time. I also use it at night as part of my skincare routine. So far, one of the best moisturizers."
"let it do the rest I have tried this for a week now and all I can saw is wow! I have extremely dry skin that is very sensitive as well. Not only do I wake up with soft, moisturized skin that feels supple, I love the fact that I have had absolutely no sensitivy problems. Such a relief to know that I can put this on, and let it do it's thing while I sleep! Life having little elves on my face! And a little goes a long way. PS: my husband has used it 3 times during this time at night, seasonal dry skin."
"Never too early to start I'm in my early 30's but I would recommend this moisturizer to ANYONE of any age group who wants a top notch product. I use this daily in the morning after a normal cleansing routine. It goes on light and smooth with a pleasant scent. I have somewhat sensitive skin and can break out easily but I've yet to do so with this moisturizer. I also tend to suffer from redness/ruddiness during the dry, colder months and haven't since using this product. My skin has never felt softer."
"Great product Love It I have mature skin and the Loreal Revita lift Triple Power moisturizer is a nice moisturizer, its not too heavy, smells great and feels good on my skin. I use it in morning under my makeup. There is no sunscreen in this product just remember to add some type of SPF to the skin to prevent sun damage. I also use a little at night just after using the Revita lift serum. After using over a period of time I could see a slight change in the texture of my skin."
great cream Great product and walmart had it at lowest price
"Review Update I have to update my previous review, after using the Shishedo Super Revitalizing cream for only 4 days I am back to this Loreal cream, sometimes you don't realize how well something is working until you stop using it for a few days, I have even purchased the Loreal LZR serum to match, sorry I stopped using this, I have returned yet another 100 jar of luxurious cream for my favorite best ever Loreal LZR, thanks Loreal."
"works great for me My husband accidentally purchased another brand, so, used that one up before I purchased my Revitalift again. Noticed the difference almost overnight. Happy to have my Revitalift again, the lines and wrinkles are a lot less prominent than before. My skin is happy again"
"RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer OMG. This product is amazing. It went on so smooth. It wasn't too thick or runny. As soon as I put it on, it worked. It lasted the whole day. It didn't leave my face greasy or sticky. My makeup went right on top of it. Moisturizer lasted all day, right up til I took my makeup off, then I reapplied it before bed. It lasted the whole night. Finally,something that works. It is definitely a little pricey for just a moisturizer but it is well worth it."
"My skin looks and feels amazing! To be honest, I thought this was just going to be a sample I put in the emergency outta moisterizer drawer, however, I used it right away on a whim and I LOVED it! It seemed to effortlessy glide right into my skin and, after using it twice a day, I was amazed at how much better my skin looked and felt. My makeup stayed fresher and the few wrinkles I have tightened up. No dry patchs in December!! Only con....it has a very strong fragrance."

"LOVE L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer! L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is a god-send! I LOVE this moisturizer! I have used it for the past 3 weeks every night as my last facial product. I am a 3xs a week Retin-A user (for anti-aging) and my skin really needs a lot of moisture to balance out the drying effects of Retin-A. I like to use products that are a little heavier at night because my skin soaks them up throughout the night pretty well. Sometimes I feel like I need to use a moisturizer first thing in the morning as well because my skin usually feels pretty dry. I used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer on my face, neck and decollete. Sometimes I would treat my hands too. When using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer at night, my skin was surprisigly still pretty fabulously moisturized in the morning (versus other products I have tried). It is easily absorbed by my face without leaving any greasy traces. I love the light, fresh, floral scent too. The added bonus is the anti-aging ingredients that are added to this moisturizer: Pro-Xylane and Hyaluronic Acid. Together, these ingredients help my skin to be more radiant in the morning and nice and soft- a big win win in my book, especially since I am combatting dry Retin-A skin all the time! I felt like my skin looked more rested and therefore, more youthful. I did not use this moisturizer in my morning routine, but after these great nighttime results, I am going to try it out. The only thing I would change would be the packaging. The jar is beautiful, however, I would really like it to come with a pump so the active ingredients are not exposed to the air and the amount used could be more controlled. Lastly, I would definitely recommend L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer to a friend and will most definitely be using it on myself in the future!

"Sunburned Children! I used this on my 2 boys on the 4th of July, ages 5 9. We have a huge block party with water balloons, swimming, playing in sprinklers. The boys were in their suits all day i re-applied several times through out the day, each time I put it on the boys, they were wet. Well at the end of the day, they were also very burned! I used a coppertone on my daughter and she did not get burned at all. I have been telling all my friends NOT to buy this I would never buy it again."

"Extremely moisturizing, smooth and leaves skin silky soft. The biggest questions I had before I received these items were: What results should I expect and what is the timeline in which I should receive those results. The boxes are clearly labeled on the steps and order in which to use them and also the time frame of when to see results. I am highly impressed with all the information that I received, the results I am seeing and all of the compliments I am getting about my skin and it's been just over a week! The Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer is fragment free and doesn't leave any odor. It is absolutely amazing! Here's my skin story: I have extremely sensitive, dry and hard to moisturize skin. I usually have to reapply facial lotion at least 3 times a day to keep my skin from feeling tight or looking dry and if I had makeup on.. well there really wasn't much I could do. I was very skeptical because as many of you have probably done as well, I've tried everything from expensive to cheap lotions only to be left with no results and lost of money. L'Oral Deep Acting Moisturizer is the absolute best Lotion I have ever tried! It leaves my skin soft and smooth without being greasy or shiny. I've also noticed when I apply foundation it doesn't crease around my eyes or get caked up and stays on longer and looks freshly put on throughout the whole day! I also use it with the Serum every night. It has been a little over a week since I have started using this product and I definitely notice that my skin is smoother, softer, more youthful looking and the wrinkles under my eyes are fading! This is in only 1 week! I can't wait to see how much better my skin feels and looks in a couple of weeks. I highly recommend this to people of all skin types(do a little test prior to applying to entire face just to be sure). I'm just starting to get wrinkles and I believe as I continue to use these L'Oral RevitaLift products they will continue to reduce the signs of aging. I am going to buy these sets as Christmas and birthday gifts for my loved ones and friends. I have recommend them to all of my friends, family and social media sites. Thank you Bzzagent and L'orealParis for allowing me to try these amazing items! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"RevitalLift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer I live in the West it is extremely Dry, along with the climate the dryness from the furnace to heat our home, I have very dry skin. I had to let others in my age group know that Loreal RevitalLift Moisturizer is AMAZING! I have noticed that my skin is so much more nourished. The flakiness is sloughed off and my skin is smooth and nourished. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!"
"Wrinkles are less noticeable. I received Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer a couple of weeks ago. I was skeptical, but after using this twice daily, I can definately tell a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes, forehead, and around my lips. In my mid-fifties, I have been looking for something to make my wrinkles less noticeable, and this product has sure done the trick."
"Visible improvement in skin elasticity I hardly ever take time to write reviews but since this product worked so well, here I am. I'm in my early 40's and starting to notice a loss of elasticity in my neck area. Before using this cream I could pinch my neck skin and instead of popping back into place like it used to, it would stay like that for a few seconds. Within 2 days of using this cream am"
"Triple Power is Powerful Stuff! I've been using L'Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer twice a day for a few weeks now, and I highly recommend it! It's very thick and rich. It has a light, pleasant scent and is easy to apply. the cream absorbs quickly into the skin leaving it feeling silky smooth! The best part... It erases fine lines as if they were never there!"
Amazing Used this around my eyes and whole face. It helped reduce wrinkles and bags under eyes. Also firmed my face. I like that you dont have to use a lot and the texture is smooth and not greasey. It makes you skin feel smooth and healthy. Got 5 smples in the mail. Love that they give you you enough to see how it really works. Will buy this for sure.
"Does not work! I have used this sunscreen twice. The first time I got burned, but had been in the water so I thought it was because of that. Today my husband and I both used it, and we are so burned! We were outside for a couple hours and did not get wet at all. I applied it 20 minutes before we went outside and rubbed it in. My husband only used it on part of his body and those parts were just as burned as the areas he did not use it on. I definitely DO NOT recommend this product!!!"
"RevitaLift Triple Power Moisturizer Fast, effective, leaves skin feeling satiny smooth. Applied makeup over this moisturizer and noticed how much easier it was to blend. RevitaLift works better than the higher priced department store moisturizer I've used for over 15 years. I've changed brands...never thoght it would happen. Thank you for the opportunity to test this product."
Best Moisturizer I tried this Moisturizer for 5 days and used it 2xs a day and I love it. I noticed it is not greasy like most moisturozers are and made my skin feel refreshed. I get red spots all over my face after I shower from the hard water we have around my house and I have tried hundreds of lotions before and none have worked as well as this one has.
Fabulous Moisturizer I had the opportunity to try the RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and just want to say this is a wonderful product. I loved it and I especially loved the results. I'm 43 and starting to worry about wrinkles and fine-lines. There was a noticeable difference... I should say improvement... after using this product. I'm sold.
"What more can a girl ask for! I'm 49 years old and have lived in the Deep South my entire life. I've always had combination skin with dry patches. RevitaLift Triple Power is WONDERFUL! No more dry patches, no problems with it being to oily, the soft fragrence is a very nice plus! Firmer, smoother, clearer skin, what more can a girl (okay, grown girl) ask for"
"The best moisturizer I have been having problems with dry patches on my face. I have been trying everything. The RevitaLift Triple Power not only took care of these dry patches but gives my face a smooth, firmer looking skin. I loved this moisturizer so well I went out and purchased the eye and serum as well. I am hoping the results will be amazing."
"Great Product! I received samples of this in the mail and have been using it for about two weeks and love it! I have always taken really good care of my skin and tried alot of different products. I use this at night with one of the L'Oreal Eye treatments. It's not too heavy, not greasy.....just right!! I would highly recommend trying it!"
Very soft skin I so enjoyed using Revitalift Triple Power Moisturizer. It was so silky smooth to the touch. I liked how it made my skin so soft but not oily feeling. My skin stayed soft all day!!! I will be buying this in the future. You don't have to use alot of the moisturizer either so this makes it worth the extra money to get.
"lots of moisture As soon as I applied it to my face, I noticed how creamy it was and sliky. What really made me know that it was working, was the fact when i washed my face the next morning, I felt my face feeling different when I applied my face soap it felt like I just moisturized it, I swear my skin felt so moist. I LOVE IT."
"MUST have After the first day of a 5 step sample of Rivatalift Triple Powder Moisturizer, I purchased the full-size. That is a FIRST for me. I adore this product, it genuinely worked over night on my under eye bags and my skin felt so firm! This is a must-have for me and I will be repurchasing time and time again."
"Best Ever I used my 5 day free trial cream and loved it. Now I have 2 jars of cream. I don't want to be without it, it works great. I can already see the difference in my skin. Wrinkles have lessened and my skin seems tighter. You should try this at least once to form your own opinion. You won't be disappointed."
"We still burned, and this turned our skin orange After applying as directed, we went swimming and then reapplied after an hour. We burned in that one hour! Not only that, but our skin is a rusty orange color! It looks like we sprayed ourselves with a cheap self tan. We have used the regular Neutrogena Sun Block spray and this did not happen. Went for the wet skin bottle this time and it didn't work for us."

"Best sunscreen product ever I have used Neutrogena Wet Skin many times since it first came out and its the best sunscreen I have ever used. I spray this in my hands to put on my face and spray and spread around on the rest of me. This will stick to my skin while I am still sweating, which is essential! I also do not have issues with sunscreen running in my eyes and stinging. I HIGHLY recommend this sunscreen. Be aware that it is more difficult to remove (good makeup wipes work great) and may stain lighter colored swimsuits."
Wonderful skin rejuvenation This product feels so good on my skin and I can feel the smoothing and tightening of my skin after the first four days of use. My skin appearance has changed and is more luminous and radiant already. I am using also the moisturizer and say cream to optimize the results. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Best thing since sliced bread We live in our pool and I can never get my husband or kids to put on sunscreen because they hate the feel of lotions (so do I), and they don't want to interrupt their swimming to dry off and reapply sunscreen. This is great - I carry it around with me and spray everybody, even if they're dripping. You can see this bead up the moisture on the skin, so you know it's not rinsing off. We all tan like crazy, so we don't use this to prevent sunburn, but it seems to stop us from getting too tan and it keeps our skin soft. Be careful not to inhale when you spray this - it's not a good experience."
"Super Moisturized! I was skeptical about this at first, the lotion is thick and a little bit goes a LONG ways. I was worried it would make my skin greasy, instead it was moisturized all day long and even helped minimize oil on my skin! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Works on this pale skin Being extremely pale-skinned, I've received my fair share of sunburns, even after using sunblock, although admittedly probably not often enough. I've been using this sunblock most of the summer and have not burned, even with a few all day outings! I love how easy it is to apply and it doesn't make your skin stay white like some mineral-based sunscreens. Loving this product -- it's been great for all of my outdoor sports!"
"Super Light Another product from L'Oreal that is going into my regular routine. My adult acne is staying away, which has always been a source of frustration with other moisturizers. It absorbs well and doesn't seep through my face makeup. I don't have to worry about running to the ladies room to dab the excess off! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Marlea Bowser I love this Facial serum. Gives me soft smooth skin. I've used it for 10 days now and my skin feels great and looks younger ! I will continue to use this.

"Horrible lotion! I am very fair and burn easily in the sun. I was excited to try this product after reading some reviews. I have tried this lotion several times, thinking I was applying it wrong or something. Everytime I use it, It leaves blotches, especially on my arms and chest no matter how much I tried to rub it in evenly. It also took too long to completely dry. If it is not completely dry, you will have lighter spots where your clothes rub your skin or where your arms bend and such. I just cannot stand still for 30 minutes to an hour for the lotion to dry, not touching anything! The color looked pretty orange. It also had a very bad smell after it was left on for a few hours. Also, it washes right off in the shower so don't even think about taking a bath with this because you will be bathing in orange water. The only thing I do like about the lotion is that it gives you color right away and becomes darker over time, but it'd be better if the color wasn't orange. I absolutely HATE this product and I do not recommend it to anyone, especially fair skinned people."

Smooth skin! I've been using the moisturizer for a few weeks now. I hadn't noticed a difference in my skin but my 7 year old was on my lap the other day and snuggled up to my cheek.

WISH IT WAS RETURNABLE I was excited to get this sunless lotion cause it didn't have a lot of bad reviews. As soon as I read them I rushed off to Wal-Mart to get it. I got home and read the directions twice before I applied it. I started from bottom to top of my body and got my husband to help with my back just to insure no streaks. As soon as I put it on I was getting the color. And the smell wasn't bad at all. It says to dry completely before you put your clothes back on and to wait 2-3 hours before you get your final color. The 3rd hour came and gone and I could barely tell any difference at all. So I decided to sleep with it on. Got up the next morning and took a shower. The water was Orange and it was so greasy. Took forever for that part to go away. When I got out I looked at my toes and streaks everywhere! I rubbed it off with the towel thinking Itwouldn't come off and I was about to be stuck with orange streaked toes. It came right off. I looked it the mirror to see what my body looked like and OMG orange and streaks all over!!!!! If I could put a pic. on here and show you I would. white spots everywhere. I would not use this again and would not want my friends to look like this.
"Excellent Moisturizer As in my other reviews, I should start off by telling you my skin type, I think that is very important in understanding if my review will be helpful to you. I have fair skin but tan very easily, more oily than dry and have occasional breakouts and am in my mid-30's. Using a heavy moisturizer has always been a terrible adjustment for my skin because of the oily sensitive nature of it. But I wanted to give this moisturizer a fair chance. It was very thick compared to what I normally use and comes in a jar (which is convenient for getting every last drop of the product). I was amazed for how thick this was (it is definitely more a cream than a lotion), that it blended in quickly to my skin and the only thing that was left was soft skin. There is no oily residue or even any trace that I put it on (except for the softness of course). The scent is the same as the other produces in the Triple Power line, pleasant and not overpowering. I use this in the pm and the first few mornings I woke up with more than normal oily skin. That was expected because my body needs a chance to get used to the chance and to figure out it's oil balance...the more moisture your skin gets the less oil it needs to produce so when you start using a cream or lotion your body will learn to produce less overtime. Now I have no problem and my skin is very soft and visually looking better. And no breakouts! Yay! Its been several weeks since I've started using this and 2 other L'Oreal products in the RevitalLift Triple Power line (Concentrated Facial Serum and the Day lotion moisturizer SPF 20 which I have also reviewed) and absolutely love all three. I would definitely recommend this and the other products in this line! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Very Smooth I was very excited to try this product, and it did not disappoint at all. My skin feels smooth and I really like the light scent. I had no problems with my regular makeup routine, nor did the cream get dry or flaky like other products that I've tried in the past. Ready to try again tonight and in the morning! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Amazing moisturizer! This L'Oral deep-acting moisturizer lives up to the hype! It is moisturizing without being too greasy and works well under makeup and especially in the evening. I put the serum underneath for some extra umph and I love it. My skin feel plumped, refreshed and nourished. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loved it!!! I tried the Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer tonight after using the serum! It was very thick, and I was afraid it would feel very greasy on my skin. It actually went on light and absorbed quickly! It left my skin feeling soft and smooth, and it smells so nice! I would definitely recommend this product!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
L'Real SPF 20 This is a nice finishing touch product. Love the creamy texture and smell of the product. Non oily and non drying product. I've used some spf products that have left my face feeling dry and cracked this product didn't. My face is soft and is not left with a shine. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
loved this product I loved the smell and my skin feels amazing after using the creme. I have extreme sensitive skin but I don't have any bad reactions to it. I live in Alaska and my face gets so dry during the winter time. This product has made it happened a lot less this year :-) This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Wonderfully Smooth! After only 3 days of using this product, I'm seeing a dramatic improvement in my skin. It's gentle enough for my sensitive skin and leaves it soft and smoothe with no greasy residue or obnoxious scent. Very pleasant, light, and can't wait to see what one week, two weeks, and beyond, this product will bring to improving my skin! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"soft and smooth I've been using this product for a couple weeks now. My skin feels well hydrated and my fine lines are dissapearing! Even the container it comes in is excellent quality. It is department store quality, for sure! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smooth and rich moisture I love using this especially at night, it leaves my skin soft and smooth, and it's light weight, it doesn't feels heavy. My pores look smaller and clean. I will definitely buy it again. You have to try it to believe it yourself. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Really great product This is my new favorite product for my face. I love the feel of it and the smell. It goes on clean and not greasy and smells great for hours. My skin has never been so soft and moisturized. Everyone asks what my secret is and I tell them about this new great product I am trying. I will have to buy more soon as I can't stop using it.

No color change I've been using this product for about a month and have seen no color change. I would like my money back.
"Worked great on my super dry skin. Although I didn't have very high expectations, I have to say that I was very pleasantly suprised at how well it worked. It has a very light pleasant scent and it left my skin feeling quenched and soft. It did not feel at all heavy or greasy. I would recommend. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I Love this Facial Moisturizer! This L'Oreal Facial Moisturizer is lightweight, non-greasy and smells great! I use it every night after putting on the L'Oreal Serum. Only a little bit goes a long way. The packaging has a a vibrant red color and the bottle fits perfectly in my medicine cabinet. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is a non greasy facial lotion that smells great, goes on smoothly and gets absorbed quickly. It makes fine lines barely noticeable and makes my skin smoother and firmer. I apply it every night and I enjoy seeing my face glow and look younger every day. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"RevitaLift deep acting moisturizer OK been using this for about a week now and I'm pleasantly surprised how it makes my skin hydrated and soft, I haven't noticed no smoothing of any wrinkles or my small crows feet in the corners of my eyes so I'm on the fence on that but if you have slightly dry mature skin this will definitely work wonders on that aspect This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loreal Paris triple power deep acting moisturizer I was extremely happy with this product . I have very sensitive skin so there are few things I feel comfortable using. This had a very pleasant but not overwhelming smell. It made my skin feel so smooth , but not oily. I feel as though my skin looks and feels smoother. I would encourage anyone to use this.

Loreal Paris rocks! I have been sick and on top of that my husband had to be put in the hospital so I have just started using mine. So far I can't tell a difference but it hasn't been enough time yet. Still waiting for results! This review was collected as part of a promotion.

L'Oreal Parus RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I tried the serum and moisturizer so far. I love both of them Both of them are great. The moisturizer is not greasy at all like some of the moisturizers I have used in the past . I would highly recommend this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Oh so soft skin I think this product is great. My face and neck areas feel soft and radiant. I can tell a difference while using these products so much more than the brand I had used in the past. Thumbs up and high five most definitely. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Moisturizer I like it! After putting this on my face in the morning and evening, I started noticing a difference within a couple of weeks. It's non-greasy so you don't feel like you're adding oil to your face and neck. I will continue to use daily. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"TURNS YOU ORANGE This is a very fast-acting lotion, I'll give it that. My problem is that after using it for about a week (like it says on the bottle), I turned a color that was more of a yellow/orange than anything else. Run away!!!!!!!"
So ready for winter! I am loving thelse revitalize products I only just used last night and my skin has stayed moisturized all day! I have a hard time because my skin is dry in the t-zone and most moisturizers create toomuch moisture and I get a pimple bc my pores get clogged. This stuff feels amazing and I can't wait to see the month results of the anti aging benefits! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Love love love What an amazing moisturizer. My face is combination dry and oily while using this product my face does not feel dry and itchy. I have a glow on my face that reflects good hydration and I'm loving how my face feels. I use this twice a day and face face feels amazing. Dry skin is smooth and not flakey. I'm in love with this moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great product for dry skin! I think that this is a great product that helps with my dry skin. With the winter coming and the cooler weather, I feel like my face is getting drier and drier, but when I used this moisturizer, my face felt so smooth and not greasy. It stayed on all day and really helped my skin! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
You gotta try this I recently received this buzz kit. I got it in the mail and couldn't wait to try it. I've just turned 41 and beginning to see the first signs of aging. This moisturizer makes those little lines fade away. If you have never tried this it is definitely something you will want to try. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great Moisturizer I really liked this moisturizer. It has a nice, light scent and it isn't too harsh for my skin. Another good thing is that you don't have to use a lot of the product so it will last you a lot longer. I think it makes my face look smoother and it definitely feels smoother. I think this would be a great moisturizer for any skin type. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Best moisturizer ever!! I have been using this product for over a week and I can already see and feel a difference! I really love the facial moisturizer! I have been applying this product at night before I go to bed and when I wake up my face still feels as soft as it did when I first put on the product the night before! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer This stuff is amazing! Usually night creams are quite a bit heavy and it sort of feels like your skin can't breathe. But this L'Oreal Paris Revitalift has a light airy feel that is just wonderful. I've had night creams that have left like grease spots on my pillowcases before, but not this. I give this 2 thumbs up!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My thoughts on L'Oreal I used the facial moisturizer and I must admit that I didn't like it at first but that is because clearly I used too much. A lot goes a long way with this and when I put less on, my skin felt fantastic! I love this as it moisturized and didn't make my skin feel oily. I will definitely purchase this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal, Paris, Revitalift Triple Power Moisturizer Been using this for a month and just love it. Even my pores appear to be shrinking. And, I love the soft skin I feel when I run my fingers over my face. It has been years since my face felt so soft. I feel like I look younger! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love this lotion I have been using RevitaLift facial moisturizer for about a week now and I really love it. It absorbs nicely into your skin and leaves your face feeling soft and healthy. I've noticed a difference in the appearance of my fine lines and will continue to use this product even though I've been an Olay user for years. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Not impressed Have used Summer Color light/medium on my legs according to directions nearly every day for over a month. There has been absolutely no color change. I've had success with other sunless tanning products. Going back to them.
"Nice to fall asleep to I was looking for a new line of products to use as I was using another line. When I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, I LOVED it!! It is so rich feeling and my skin soaks it up and feels luxurious!!! My skin feels pampered while using it and it is very rich and a great moisturizer.

Serum and deep acting moisturizer I am just starting to try the loreal triple power products so I can only review the fragrance which is light and the immediate way it makes my skin feel. My skin felt very cool and dewy right after using. When I woke up in the morning it still felt very soft. I am really curious if my skin tone will improve or wrinkles will lessen over time. I will write again after a week and also three weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Mary Geyer I like the colors of the bottle and lids. Has a lightly pleasant smell, not over powering. Has a little sparkle in it that makes your skin look radiant and fresh. Not greasy or sticky. Used long enough to see some elasticity returning. Skin feels soft and smooth. I will definitely continue to use once this is gone. Nice product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal Paris Rivitalift Triple Power Deep- Acting Facial Moisturizer Perfect with my combination skin! Leaves my skin smooth and breathable. No heavy or filmy feel, which I love! Under makeup allow to completely dry before applying foundation, the lotion will then allow your makeup to glide on smoothly. My skin never looked or felt better. This moisturizer is my new go to!Great light fragrance too! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Day Lotion The Loreal Triple Power Sunscreen is excellent.. I am using this product as a daily regime and I can really tell the difference in my skin. My skin feels very good after 3 days of use. I'm not worried about too much exposure to the sun because my looks and feels protected. Our Louisiana weather can be tough on the skin but mine has a fresh feel all day with this product.

"Moisture over night This product is hands down my favorite moisturizer that I own. I have such flaky dry skin and even the mall brand moisturizers couldn't repair it but this did it nearly overnight. Within a week, my dryness was completely healed. My skin was soft and supple. I will most DEFINITELY buy again This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Perfect for me As soon as I could get in the habit of using it twice a day, I saw results. It helped the crepy skin on my neck the fine lines around my eyes. It's so light that my face wasn't greasy or oily! I always wanted to try it but without wasting money on a product I wouldn't use. Perfect for me! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Soft to the Touch My sensitive skin loves this night time moisturizer. It is gentle, softly fragranced, blends in quickly, yet works hard to keep my older skin soft, supple, and looking younger than its years. I have started receiving compliments on my skin, and at my age of 55, that makes me feel beautiful again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"this is sweet! This facial moisturizer rocks! At first the scent was a bit strong but has now dissipated with use. It is rich and creamy, not greasy and simply easy to apply. If you want a moisturizer that isn't too heavy for daytime wear, yet is thick enough to restore your skin at night, this is certainly it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Finally a moisturizer that works! Over the last few years, with the birth of my two children, my face has gone through many changes: combo to dry to oily to dry and back to oily. Oil free moisturizer left my skin dry and face creams made me feel like my makeup was going to slide off. The L'Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Day/Night is light without feeling too greasy. It absorbs well too. SO glad I had the opportunity to try it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Don't waste your money! I'm very pale and I didn't want to look like Casper during the summer so I got on here and looked at the reviews for this and they were all good so I bought it. It does work. I used it 3 days in arow once a day just so I could get to the color I wanted all over my body. After the third day I stopped and the second day after I stopped putting it on my hands, feet, chest, and arms got blochy. So I had unsightly pale spots and then really tan spots all over so I decided to use it again. When I put it on and waited for three hours for it to set and get it's color I turned orange! So not only did I have spots I was orange! So if you don't put it on everyday you get spots but if you do put it on everyday you turn orange, I hate this product. And that's not the only thing, if you don't use this in large amounts you will get streaks. Since the bottle is so small and I use it for my whole body I only got 6 uses out of it. If you're pale like me I wouldn't recommend this product at all!"
Little goes a long way I started using the Deep Acting Moisturizer at night time about a week ago. I have ditched my old moisturizer for this one. I really love to use this along with the serum. My face feel so soft now. However do note that you only need a little to cover your entire face and neck. If you use to much it will feel heavy. I will keep using this every night before bed. :) This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love this product!!! Rich, creamy, beautiful light scent when you open this product. Goes on light, absorbs and drenches your skin beautifully. Repaired, re-firmed and left my aging skin feeling resiliently beautiful. Would highly recommend. Love this RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer. I so needed this. Thank you L'Oreal.

Deep acting moisturizer Im in Love. No more wasting money. When your husband notices improvement you know it's good. My skin is now supple without being oily. The T Zone I've struggled with for so long seem to be fading. The adult acne is getting better. I'm starting to notice spots are fading. I just can't say enough good about this product. I'm so glad I tried it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Stayinyoung I started using this product over the last few days and we have budded a new friendship. I have very sensitive skin and really limited on what I can use. I tried this product, and the only reaction I had was softer skin. No irritation or redness at all. It's only been a few days so I'm anxious to see how my skin feels and looks after trying it for a few weeks! I'll keep you posted! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great moisturizer This product caused my skin to be extremely soft and looking fresh. When using the facial moisturizer my skin didn't feel caked on or oily. I didn't even feel the need to wear makeup due to already having fresh and bright looking skin. I will definitely continue to use this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Softest skin EVER!! This moisturizer leaves my skin silky soft and smooth ! Not only did my skin look more fresh and youthful , but it also seemed to stop the pores from being plugged up which has been a major problem as I age. I highly recommend this moisturizer !! By the way, I just turned 56 !! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Moisturizer I've always been a fan of L'Oreal skincare products and this is no exception. I love finding a moisturizer that is great for both day and night and moiturizes well without being greasy, this fits the bill! The scent is light but pleasant and it's very comfortable on the skin. I put on a bit more at night for extra moisture, but it works great day or night! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loved this I really am hesitant to try facial products as many of them make my face break out. However, I tried out the revitalift triple power facial moisturizer and absolutely loved it!! It did not feel oily on my skin, and smelled amazing. Even my boyfriend, who works outside, is excited to use it for the winter months. I absolutely loved this product!

Love the smoothness! I have been using this in combination with the serum. I am really enjoying this product because it leaves my face feeling fresh smooth! I don't have any greasy look or feel to my face. I haven't been using the product more than 3 weeks so I'm not too sure if it actually benefiting my skin but I do like the feel look that I am getting to this point!

"Skin so soft This moisturizer has done wonders in the 2 weeks that I have used it. My skin feels softer, smoother and refreshed since using this product. After applying, I usually wait 5 minutes before putting on make-up. It has helped a lot to keep those dry spots under control. Quick tip: You don't need a lot when applying, a little will go a long way. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Is it causing itch rash for me I like the results, except I think it's causing my skin to itch like crazy... I'm trying to find out other products you have that might not do that.."
"Perfect nighttime moisturizer I loved trying this! It's a thicker moisturizer so it was perfect for my nighttime facial routine. My face felt nice without that weird caking that some moisturizers have done in the past on me. Will continuing using until it's gone to determine if there were any major changes to my appearance, but in the meantime, I'm enjoying the product very much! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Lightweight but WORKS Loved the feel of this moisturizer, it didn't feel weighty but it worked wonderfully on my skin without causing any irritation or breakouts (I have very sensitive skin). I was hesitant given all the various products and recommendations in the marketplace but I trusted the L'Oreal name and loved that I could buy it anywhere! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This product is great This lotion is absolutely amazing! I love the texture, scent, and the light feeling it leaves on your face, yet not too greasy! The way this lotion smells is also great! My boyfriend loves thevsmell! And it has definately taken away the fine wrinkles around my mouth especially and neck and also my crows feet! Definitely a product I would buy!

Feels so good!! I think a couple of days is too soon to see long term results with the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer but it makes me feel better already. I use it at night and in the morning I look more rested. I think it works well overnight and is softening my wrinkles. I would recommend it to anyone who is concerned about looking older.

"Feeling healthy! The Moisturizer is just awesome! At first I thought it felt heavy and greasy. But as I continued to use it at night, I realized that it was just because my face needed it SO bad! I live in Texas with a ton of sun and heat and this is just what my skin needed. My skin feels softer and my freckles have faded :). Love it This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"2 birds - one stone! This facial moisturizer is amazing :) It has a thick, luxurious feel as it goes on and leaves my skin feeling hydrated AND looking younger and more vibrant. It is non-greasy so no need to cover my face in powder after I use it. The fine lines around my eyes are significantly less visable. I will be purchasing this product regularly in the future.

Amazing Lotion! I am very impressed with this product. I have been using it along with the facial serum and am very pleased with the results. It has worked better than I ever thought it would. The lotion is thick and does not leave a greasy feeling after applying it. It rubs in nicely and your face is left feeling fresh and clean. I highly recommend these products.

"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I loved trying this. Smells good and it goes on smooth. There's nothing about this that I didn't not like. I'm not big on using more than one thing when I'm cleaning my face. But using this with the concentrated serum works great together. I was skeptical at first, but the more I use it the more I like it. I'm definitely sticking with these. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer Still loving this moisturizer. I have been using this daily for a few weeks now and I love the results.

"self tanner BE PREPARED.....unless you mix this with a light lotion, like Curel mix equal parts, you may have that orangy tint.I saw a video on utube a gal mixed about 1 teaspoon of moisture lotion with 1 teaspoon of this tanner.Now i only use it on my fingers. Just below the knuckles as i tan everywhere BUT THERE! I did it the first time it really didn't change a lot. I should have waited til the next day do it again. Instead, i got impatient just put it over my fingers by itself, not moisture lotion with it. I did it 2 times like that it turned kinda orangy. You have to wipe it off the bends of your fingers as well, or it sets in darker also wipe it off the palms of your hand. That was the only part that turned orange had i have keep using it with the lotion, i don't think i would have had that orangy look. Make sure you don't get it on the inner part of your fingers too. I can't find that video anymore but the girl was very good informative.Read full review..."
Love this product Love it
A great product This is a great product. I don't usually use any products on my face because in the past they have left my face feeling oily. This product didn't do that at all.

Face product I think this L'Oreal Revitalift Deep Moisturizer is a great product. It helps reduce wrinkles. I never thought I had that many wrinkles until trying this product because now I can see a big difference in my face.

Loved the moisturizer I shared the L'Oral Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer with my Mother. She liked it a lot and so did I.

Easy application and dries quickly This is a fairly good product. It's easy to see where it has been applied which helps to get an even application. It dries and tans quickly but needs a couple applications to get decent color. It does have the unpleasant odor but not as strong as other brands. I would buy it again.
"L'Oreal Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer Due to my sensitive skin and many allergies I was concerned about this product but decided to take the plunge and go for it. Boy, am I glad I did.

"Excellent night cream..... As a full-time caregiver to my husband that has a Traumatic Brain Injury, it is very difficult to find time to take care of myself. Stretrgically placing this moisturizer right by my seat along with some facial wipes, I find that I am taking the time to apply this moistizer ngihtly. The feel of the moistuizer is very luxurious This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great moisturizer I use this one in the evening after cleaning my face and applying the facial treatment serum. I let the two work overnight and wake up to a soft feeling skin. At first I was reticent, but after using it for almost two weeks, I think I can see some results. I plan on using it for a while and compare results after a month or two.

"My best face! 42 and still being mistaken for early 30's! This cream keeps my skin so hydrated which in turn keeps my skin tight, wrinkle free and clear! I can't be without it! Trust me, my skin is so amazing and this is why!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"self tanner BE PREPARED.....unless you mix this with a light lotion, like Curel mix equal parts, you may have that orangy tint. I saw a video on utube a gal mixed about 1 teaspoon of moisture lotion with 1 teaspoon of this tanner. Now i only use it on my fingers. Just below the knuckles as i tan everywhere BUT THERE! I did it the first time it really didn't change a lot. I should have waited til the next day do it again. Instead, i got impatient just put it over my fingers by itself, not moisture lotion with it. I did it 2 times like that it turned kinda orangy. You have to wipe it off the bends of your fingers as well, or it sets in darker also wipe it off the palms of your hand. That was the only part that turned orange had i have keep using it with the lotion, i don't think i would have had that orangy look. Make sure you don't get it on the inner part of your fingers too. I can't find that video anymore but the girl was very good informative."
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I have tried the moisturizer for 2 weeks now, and I really like it. The cream spreads very easily and a little goes a long way. It leaves skin feeling very soft and smooth without feeling thick or heavy on the face. Already my skin looks brighter and feels hydrated all day. It has a very pleasant smell but it may be a little strong for some people. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great product This facial moisturizer like others from the L'Oreal line works very good. I like it because is not greasy and you can use it alone or with other treatments. Not strong fragrance. You can see the difference, your skin will look smooth almost instantly. I have acne and this cream does not make it worse. I recommend it as well as all of these line products. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer Triple Power. Yeah you can say that again! First the moisturizer sinks into my skin and became invisible(showing no white lines). Second, The Hyaluronic Acid did not sting or cause redness on my face, which i have had trouble in the past with other products like this. Third, my face felt good, smooth, refreshed like it use to. Can't wait to see more results with further use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This is amazing moisturizer! I love this moisturizer! It goes on easy and smooth. It doesn't make my skin feel oily or greasy. The fragrance isn't overwhelming and is just right. My face feels comfortable and isn't tight. The moisturizing cream itself is thick and creamy. I'm looking forward to using this moisturizer all winter! I'll definitely be using this again.

"Love that added sunscreen! I just started using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer last week. I am 36, and I am just starting to see some fine lines around my eyes. I can't speak to whether it improves fine lines or wrinkles yet, because I have only been using it for about a week now. But I'll tell you about what I've noticed about the product so far. Pros: -It goes on light and absorbs well into my skin. I hate heavy, greasy products. This is not greasy or thick. -It has added SPF 30 sunscreen. This is SO important in a daily moisturizer, and definitely will help prevent wrinkles. -I had some acne spots on my face when I started using this product. I did not have any additional breakouts as a result of using this product. -Although the 1.7 oz bottle seems small, you only need a very small amount to cover your whole face. I think this one bottle would last me a couple months. -The packaging is very cute! I love the deep red and purple colors. Cons: -The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power system involves using at least three different products. It can be expensive to buy all three products, and it's a bit of a hassle to use all three over the course of a day. If you like using multiple products, it's not a big deal, but for me, I think I'd prefer a more simple routine. -It is a scented product, which may not be appropriate for sensitive skin. The scent is nice, though--a light, clean scent, and it is less overpowering than some other products I have tried. Overall: I liked this product a lot. I think it worked well for my skin, and I would recommend it to others. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love this! I really like the feel of this moisturizer. It almost feels like it dries instantly with a powder smooth feel. I love the scent as well. I've noticed that the bags under my eyes are gone and my crows feet have lightened. I have even received a compliment on my skin and I have only been using the moisturizer for a little over a week. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"My skin! It's so soft! I've been using this product every day for a week now, and my skin feels so good! I'm always dry and flaky, especially in the fall/winter. I usually slather my face with moisturizer and hope for the best. I actually use about a quarter size amount of this product, and it soaks into my skin and makes it feel so soft and smooth. I will definitely be buying this once I run out. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Skin feels so smooth! I just started using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer about a week ago when I received it. I use it after the serum and it makes my skin feel so smooth and soft. I enjoy the fragrance! In the places where it was dry, it is no longer dry and the places that were oily are not oily! I expect to see even more results the longer I use it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Hydration to my skin Since trying out the Deep-Acting Moisturizer my skin is now really hydrated. I have some really dry spots on my facial area normally around my cheeks and jaw line. Those areas are now looking firm and radiant. I also noticed less of a wrinkle in between my brow areas. This product I recommend and is now going to be part of my beauty facial line. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Worth buying! I have tried several moisturizers over the years, but I have finally tried the last one! I will not buy another brand! I feel my skin's softness all day long. While this is not one of its adervising points, my makeup goes on so much smoother because of this! Another great aspect is the value! It only takes a little bit for my skin, and so I know it will last a while! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Streaked Just tried this product for the first time. It did streak, even though it's advertised that it doesn't streak. Would not recommend without giving a heads-up that this product does streak. Color was good except for the streaking."
"Best facial moisturizer I've used in a long time! This moisturizer is the best I have used in a long time, probably ever. Completely non-greasy, absorbs quickly and my skin has felt amazing. Looks great under makeup and doesn't give the skin a wet appearance when not wearing makeup. This is a product I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a new facial moisturizer. I will be buying this product again and again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love the new L'Oreal products! The moisturizer has improved the look and feel of my facial skin after using it along with the serum and lotion. I've been faithfully applying it morning and night and love how little product it takes to cover the entire face and neck areas I was a little apprehensive at first since it is a more expensive product but I can see now it will last quite awhile because of the absorption qualities of the product. Definitely will continue using these L'Oreal products in the future!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Product Review: L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer This product is my new-found favorite facial cleansing system regiment. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth, which is something that my facial skin was lacking prior to the start of my using this product. It goes on smoothly and only takes a few small dabs of the product to cover my face. When I finish applying it for the day or night, my face feels refreshed and younger looking. I will definitely start using this product on a regular basis. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loreal is now my only skin care Before I started using this lotion, my skin had blotches and fine lines. You could not help to see my pores. Within days of starting to use this lotion, my pores looked smaller. The red blotches and wrinkles started fading. After several weeks my skin is evenly toned. Wrinkles are less defined. My face looks fuller and smoother. I have tried other brands before from department stores, and none have worked as well as Loreal. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Triple the Power! This moisturizer does back up its' claim as being three times the product! Immediately after applying, my skin does feel hydrated...as if the moisture is going right into the area, giving it a healthy glow. Also, the feeling, or texture, of the skin feels somehow smoother and softer. I will continue using this and am sure the other promised attributes will follow...younger and firmer facial skin is a great goal at my age....or any age for that matter!!

A+++ Moisturizer When I think of a moisturizer I think of tons of dollars I have to spend so my face doesn't feel dried out and cracked. However after using this L'Oreal moisturizer I am a believer in the fact that a good moisturizer does not have to cost an arm and a leg. The creaminess of this moisturizer is amazing it went on so smooth and my face still felt replenished all day. I love the way it laid with my face makeup this is definitely going to be a product that I use for now on. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Thick and Powerful When I opened this container I surprised by the pleasant smell. It had sort of a floral smell to it and not the familiar chemical smell I've experienced in the past. I took just a small amount at first and found that it was much thicker then most moisturizers. Although it was thick it was easy to spread over my face and absorbed quickly without too much rubbing. After several hours I did notice that my skin did seem exceptionally smooth and soft. I'm excited to see what continued use will do! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love this stuff I absolutely love this moisturizer! Being that I have sensitive skin and get dry spots in the winter months due to hot showers and weather, this product is GREAT!! It makes my face super soft and a little goes a long way. It does what its suppose to do, my face hasn't been dry in weeks and looks great. My breakouts have even stopped! Yay! And it has tightened my skin with my forehead wrinkles fading away. I would buy this product and recommend it to family and friends. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Excellent Moisturizer I think this is the best product for those with dry skin. I have used this product daily and will continue to use this product in place of another moisturizer that I have used. The best uses for this product is daily usage after a shower for those with dry skin. I don't have anything but pros about this product: absorbs quickly, goes on smoothly, moisturizes well, not greasy, and lasts long. I would strongly recommend this product to a friend This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"LOVE This Product My skin seems to get really dry during this time and year, and this product has been a godsend. I apply a light application after cleansing my face in evening and it absorbs quickly into the skin without residue. It leaves my skin feeling so hydrated and actually a lot firmer. The overall appearance of my skin has improved greatly. The slight scent is clean and refreshing. I would buy this product over and over again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Sunless Tan Will turn you orange if not very careful. Do not apply heavy. I'm a pale skin blonde
"Super Moisturizing Lotion! I use L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer on dry skin days and at night, and I've noticed that my skin is particularly hydrated - even with the dropping temperatures (when my combination face gets especially dry on the cheek area). I love this stuff! It's very rich, so I tend to only use it on my cheeks and neckline, but I highly recommend it for dry or combination skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Moisturizer! L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is a GREAT product! Living in Alabama, my skin dries out daily. So I was excited to try L'Oreal. With a SPF protection, I was stoked to first feel how smoothly it went on. It wasn't greasy and absorbed quickly. Going out in this sun, L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer protected my face and lasted for hours. This moisturizer is luxuriously pleasant.

"smooth creamy The Deep acting Facial moisturizer is a great product. I have been using it nightly for 2 weeks now. You can feel the moisture in your skin after using it. My skin looks 80 times better then it did. I have been telling everyone I know, (Co workers , my adult children, friend and family) about how great this product works to keep my face moist and not drying out. It's a great value, and when combined with the other products in the trio , is priceless. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Sleep easy in this moisturizer! I have tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer and really enjoy it. I use it before bed after washing my face. The moisturizer is not heavy and does not leave a residue on my face or pillows. Even my son likes it! Mommy , your face smells good!, he said after I applied it one evening. It is light and leaves my face looking refreshed in the morning. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is really the answer to my prayers. I have used it for a short time, along with their Day Lotion and their Facial Serum Treatment, and I am amazed by the change in my skin. My skin has never looked or felt better - smoother, softer, and glowing!! I've purchased and thrown away so many products in the past, but I have finally found the products that I will use for the rest of my life!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Silky smooth This L'Oreal Triple Power Deep Acting Day/Night Moisturizer with hyaluronic acid is awesome! It's thick and rich, a very creamy moisturizer that brings to mind deep-penetrating body creams. It goes on smoothly right after using the L'Oreal serum, and feels silky and luxurious. It absorbs quickly, and I wait a few minutes before putting on foundation, but makeup goes on wonderfully with no,clumping or smearing after the morning use. I put it on before bed as well, after cleaning the old makeup off of my face. By morning my skin looks plump and refreshed. Used as a system with other L'Oreal products, so far I've had excellent results. My wrinkles are diminishing and my skin looks far more clear. This formula may also work well for those with sensitive skin, as I normally break out from many products, but have not had a single issue with this L'Oreal line. My one suggestion for improvement would be to put an interior thin plastic lid on the cream under the twist-off lid. My cream was delivered upside down, and all the cream had pooled into the top of the twist off lid, making for a bit of a challenge getting it back into the container. It also appeared to only be about half fullL'Oreal might want to consider filling the container more completely. Otherwise, this product has been perfect and I'm looking forward to seeing results at the end of 8 weeks or so. I've also been finishing up,with L'Oreal Triple Power facial Day lotion with SPF 20, so my review on that will be coming up, but so fat that is great as well.

"Favorite product in the RevitaLift line! In my opinion, this is the best product in the RevitaLift line! This is an excellent moisturizer! A little goes a long way, which is always great when you're on a budget. I felt that this is the deepest moisturizer in this line and it's great as part of either your morning or bedtime routine. It is great base for women that have normal to dry skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"worksgreat My aging skin is very dry in some areas. I also have some brown spots which are normally very dry. after the first day, I could tell a difference in my skin. It was softer and smoother. No dry patches and the brown spots are softer. Really like this product. The longer I use it the better my face looks and feels. It only takes a little each time you use it so it will last longer than you think. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is Unbeleivable I have been using this moisturizer for about a week everyday and love it. After the very first use my skin felt amazing. You only need a small amount to moisturize your entire face and neck. I am a former smoker and have been looking for a product that will bring that youthful glow back to my skin and this product does the job. I can not wait to see the results after further use of this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Ok product I looked online for a great self-tanner and saw this one had a bunch of great reviews, so I decided to buy it, since I am fair skinned and usually cannot get a natural tan. Once I got it, I follwed the instructions just as it said, smoothed the product in very well, and turned out the next day to have streaks and an orangish brown tan. I was really embarrased and got called a tangerine by my friends. I thought the next day i could use it again and maybe it would smooth it out, and it did sorta but still left me with a few streaks and still an orange pigment on my skin. Also if you wanna keep the color then you have to put the lotion on a bunch! Usually after i took a shower most of my orangey tan skin color was gone! It isn't a very good product for the size and quality of it. I used about half of the bottle in less than a week. Overall I wouldnt reccomend this product unless you really want to risk getting an orangish skin color."
"moisturizing magic This is by far my favorite Loreal Revitalift product. It is super thick and creamy but soaks in deep, does not leave your skin greasy or wet at all. I've been using this as an overnight treatment for 2 weeks and my skin appears smoother and healthy. The jar is huge so go ahead and lather it on and watch for the magic. I love this and can't wait to see what happens in the next 2 weeks! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Deep moisture! L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is great for use at night before bed! In the morning my skin felt so much softer and healthier. I love the scent too. L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is great for moisturizing super dry winter skin and I will continue to use this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great Moisturizer I was very skeptical with using the moisturizer when I first tried it as it was very thick. I have oily skin so I try to stay away from any thing that might make it look more greasy. But I have to say I am very pleased with how moisturized and hydrated my skin feels and look in just over a week of using it. I dab just a little on my face and neck and even just a little bit goes a long ways. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Smells good and refresh I really like the moisturizer. Does not feel like what the brand says of Triple Power because it feels very light on the skin and it smells very good. Very light and refreshing. Even though it says to put it on my face and neck, I just want to put more on just because of how light it feels on my skin and how refreshing. A perfect after product after the serum. Both smells very good and a delight on the skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Superb moisturizer! I really liked this daily moisturizer! Just weeks after trying it for my first time, combined with the Serum and Day Lotion, I had some pretty amazing results. My fine lines had diminished around my eyes and mouth and my skin was much more taut. I will definitely be telling anyone who will listen to my story.

A must have product. I love this moisturizer. It makes my skin feel incredibly soft. It has a very light fresh sent. A little goes a very long way. Which is something I look for I a product to make sure I am get my money's worth. I use the moisturizer both day and night and have never had any problems with it. It doesn't have any greasy feeling to it at all. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Gorgeous skin 3 I would continue using the Loreal products such as the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer After only a couple of days using the product I woke up to smoother, softer skin. I have mature skin and started to notice a rough feel to my skin which was upsetting however the Deep Acting Facial moisturizer used nightly has started to completely reverse the dry rough feel to my face.

"Better than a Spa Day I will and am going to continue this L'Oral facial regimen. I have been looking for this type of combination for a while without success. The L'Oral Paris Revitalift Trio. Two day creams , two nightcreams , and a sunscreen I use over my make up. My skin feels and looks better and is just more comfortable. I think this is a wonderful product and have been using it just a short while. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"No More Dry Patches I used to have dry areas on my face. Day one of using this product changed that! My skin is moist even-toned, something I have tried to achieve, but had almost given up on. I was worried by the thickness of it because I am prone to breakouts from moisturizers. I had no need to worry! No breakouts or dry patches, I am hooked!

"Very nice clean I have been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer along with the Facial Serum and Day Lotion SPf 20 and I have to admit Ive never been fond of using alot on my face, but this light formula makes it very easy to change your mind. Its clean, light, smells wonderful, non clumping under makeup and it win me over! My face feels wonderful and more tight under my eyes where i have had trouble with sagging. Extremely great combo and I love it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good and cheap I've been searching for a self tanner that won't make me look more yellow because I'm Asian and my skin is pale and has a warm undertone so I'm already a little yellowish bc I'm asian and even more yellow with olive undertone. So it's really hard to find self tanners with a red undertone which this one has. It doesn't make me deep dark as its name but I'm 2 shades darker with only a little bit of yellow tint when with other self tanners I have tried that people claim are amazing makes me way too yellow or orange to go in public.If it works for a rare case like me, I'm sure it will work with everyone else.It doesn't cost much at least it is worth it to give it a try."
"It is powerful This facial moisturizer does lift, tighten, and tone. I use at night because I use the day lotion with spf20 for protection during the day. This cream feels really rich going on and you wake up feeling soft but toned. Use it with the serum treatment and you'll start to see and feel results in less than a week. As I continue to use the lifting, tightening and toning is more pronounced. My color has evened out because dark spots are fading too. This is a keeper. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Still smooth the next morning I loved getting a chance to try this product! My skin felt unbelievably smooth with the first application, and that feeling lasted all day. I woke-up the next morning to skin that was still smooth even though I'd used a rough facial cleanser before going to bed it took 2 days of not applying the moisturizer before it felt like I needed to moisturize again. A little goes a long way when applying. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I have been using this L'Oral facial moisturizer and I love it! It goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel so good! It works really well with the L'Oral Triple Power Serum! I have been using this moisturizer at night before bed and my skin still looks fresh in the morning. It is making my fine lines not so noticiable and my whole face looks much better using this product along with the other L'oreal triple power products. Try them and you will love them!

"Awesome product with a good price! I started using this product two weeks ago because I am trying to find a good moisturizer with a fair price. I am 48 years old with dry skin. My face gets chapped very easily. My skin just loves this product! I use it morning and night. It is easy to use, not greasy and calmed my skin immediately. This is definitely a keeper! I like the smell, but I found if you use it with the other Loreal Paris moisturizer line, it can be too strong. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My New Favorite Moisturizer I appreciated this moisturizer so much! It was light-weight and non-greasy. Once applied, my face felt rejuvenated and moisturized. My face did not feel dry after I applied the cream and continued to stay that way for the entire day. Some days I wore this underneath my makeup and felt that it did not interfere in anyway. I can easily see myself adding this moisturizer to my beauty routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"loving this moisturizer I really love the L'Oreal Revitalift deep-acting moisturizer. It has a nice creamy texture and isn't too greasy or oily. I find that it absorbs easily into the skin and has a pleasent scent that isn't too overpowering. It's too early to tell if it's helped my fine lines, but I can already tell it has helped my complexion appear brighter and helped the texture of my skin overall. It makes my skin feel so soft after use, I love it! I would definitely recommend this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Wonderfully nourishing Moisturizer I loved the Triple-Power Facial Moisturizer from L'Oreal. It is thick and hydrating without feeling like it sits heavily on your face. At the same time, it's creamy and rich and does not leave my face dry. I also loved the fragrance of the moisturizer. At the end of the day, I felt like my face had been nourished and protected for the whole day and felt smooth when I washed my face at night. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"review deep acting moisturizer I love this moisturizer!! I have extremely dry and flaky skin, so moisturizing is a must for me. This moisturizer has already improved my skin, it feels smoother and my makeup actually smooths on evenly without the scaly patches that I usually have. I would highly recommend L'Oreal paris revitalift triple power deep-acting moisturizer to my family and friends or anyone no matter what skin type, mine is also sensitive and I had no reaction. Love it!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Night Time Hydration! I typically don't buy a separate day and night moisturizer because I'd prefer to just have everything in one. However, my mind has been changed since using this deep-acting facial moisturizer. I can feel a huge difference in my skin when I wake up in the morning as it doesn't feel so tight and dry. Using this plus the serum, seems to amp up the effects even more! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Very luxorious! The Loreal Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer is very luxorious. The cream itself is rich and velvety. After the first use, I found my skin was so much softer. I use this at night and my skin is so smooth I the morning. After continued use I notice my skin stays hydrated and it appears brighter. I will definitely continue using this product. I do wish it came without a scent, though. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"great for the price! arrived a day after I ordered, color is a little orange but if you mix it with lotion or aloe vera it's good"
"Awesome product I love the way these products are starting to feel on my face! It took awhile to notice a difference, but I am definitely seeing it! Less wrinkles, and less lines in my face. Definitely has improved the overall appearance of my skin tone, too! Like anything, it takes time to notice a difference. You can't try it once, and expect results. It's been nearly two weeks, and I'm finally seeing some results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Favorite Product Since I received the triple power deep-acting I haven't stopped using it day and night. I love it! It is light scented, easy and thin going on and doesn't irritate my skin AT ALL. On top of that, I've been using the product for a few weeks now and I've noticed my skin feeling and looking healthier, fine lines diminishing and my face feeling moisturized. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Refreshed and glowing I have been using the triple power concentrate and the deep acting day/night cream in the evenings and the facial day lotion with SPF under my makeup every morning. I have been doing so for about one week and have noticed a refreshed loom with fine lines beginning to show improvements. I have normally had trouble with breakouts when trying new facial treatments, but I have not had a single one with this great series! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This is a winner I love this moisturizer . It leaves the skin feeling so soft and it still feels that way after all night. It states that it is deep acting and I can attest to that. My skin is so much smoother and more hydrated. I have used moisturizers forever and I must say this is one of my favorites as it works very quickly to soften and each time I apply, it continues to improve my skin's texture.

My Moisturizer adventure! I think I really love this product! This product is the type of product where a little goes a long way. The product I thought smelled really good and fresh. I haven't tried a lot of different moisturizer and was hesitant because I struggle with oily skin and acne however after using this product for 4 days my skin is not oily but smooth and soft!. I'm definitely going to continue using this and am happy to say it will be awhile before I run out! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Deep acting wrinkle magic eraser... , I can't get over how amazing these products are, I've been using this product along with the concentrated serum treatment , I have to say I'm extremely satisfied with the results , I've been using this product about 2 and a half weeks. My face feels great, looks great and my skin feels night and tight! I would highly recommend these products to all... give it a try! I promise you won't be let down.....

"Great product I have been using the serum for three weeks and I love it. For me, it has worked better than any other I have tried thus far. This product helps with frown lines. I have tried this product for 10 days on the deep deep lines on the sides of my mouth. Little by little the area has become fuller, smoother. This definitely did what it said it's going to do.

Amazing product. L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is an amazing product. It is so silky to touch and so smoothly to feel. The scent is very refreshing and nice.

"Fresh scent and skin feels smooth, soft, yet not greasy Really loving all of the products but I would say this is my favorite! My face and wrinkles (LOL) are softer and less defined. It absorbs into the skin without feeling greasy! It has a clean fresh scent which a woman can appreciate! I definitely recommend L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Facial Moisturizer as you will see a more softer, not shiney look to your whole face!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I love this cream! I am honest in my Bzz reviews, and I'm going to be totally honest here: This is wonderful cream! It's smooth and non-greasy. I put it on before bed and I wake up with softer skin. I have very dry skin and many lotions and creams don't penetrate my skin or they feel greasy or heavy. This cream is light but powerful. I buy expensive face creams and this less expensive, easier-to-find cream is actually better than the expensive ones. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good Value To prevent smearing, after applying it evenly where you want it, go back to it after a couple minutes and run your fingers over it again. This will even it out better and will make it look natural. Original effect only last a couple days, then it continues to fade out up to 6-7 days."
"Perfect night cream! I think the thick, creamy feel of this moisturizer is luxurious. It glides on smoothly, absorbs into my skin well. After using this for only a week, my skin definitely feels softer, smoother, and more hydrated. I think the deep-acting name fits this product because I feel like it really penetrates my skin to repair and moisturize. I haven't noticed a lift yet, but I will continue to use it.

"Amazing moisturizer I have been searching for a facial moisturizer for quite some time. My search is over. I have been using the L,Oreal Paris revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer for a little over a week and am very impressed at how hydrated/moisturizer my face is. A little went a long way and it was not greasy. This is now part of my daily routine. I have and will continue to recommend this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"soft and smooth I have very dry skin and regular moisturizer don't keep my skin hydrated for long. This deep-acting moisturizer kept my skin nourished and hydrated all day. It left my skin soft and smooth. I have been using it for only 3 days but I could also tell my face had radiance to that was not there before. I now love touch my face because it feels so soft. (BTW i am in my mid-40s). However, a little bit goes a long way. I use 3 little drops/dots for my face and that is plenty. It is completely absorbed in the morning by the time I am done with my coffee. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Mary Geyer This unscented moisturizer is thick enough to use for a nighttime moisturizer but just right to use for daytime aging skin without a heavy or sticky feeling. It's left my skin soft, feeling smoother and looking younger. Elasticity is returning to my face, particularly under and around my eyes. Using this over the concentrated skin facial serum treatment leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh with a little glow and ready for the day. I love the bottles color. I will continue to use this when I run out. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A very rich face moisturizer! I'm in my late 30's and really looking for a good moisturizer. This L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Active Facial Moisturizer definitely did the job. I really loved the consistency of the cream, it is rich and goes on very smoothly. A little does go a long way, so resist the urge to be heavy-handed with the product. It feels very rich on my face, without being heavy or 'too thick'. I like using this product at night as my nighttime moisturizer. I wake up the next morning and my skin feels incredibly supple and soft. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Wonderful as a night cream and no breakouts I love this product. It has a really nice light citrus/floral fragrance and does not feel oily. This moisturizer absorbs quickly into my skin and immediately leaves my face and neck looking younger. My face and neck feel very moisturized and soft after applying. I use this as a night cream and my face feel wonderful when I wake up. I haven't had any breakouts, which is sometimes an issue with moisturizers. I love the Loreal Paris brand and would recomend the Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Surprised! I live in a very dry climate and I thought it was just something I had to live with, but I have found a product that really really helps. I like the feel of theL'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. It goes on smooth and does not feel to heavy to me. I don't like to feel covered up in lotion and this product fits the bill. I probably would have never bought this product without being able to try it first, but L'Oreal you have scored a new customer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"FAVORITE!!! I am completely in LOVE with this moisturizer! I noticed after I used it the first night that my skin felt so much softer! It was like velvet! Could not wait to use it the next morning, and even used a little on my hands! They felt like I was wearing satin gloves! A little goes a LONG way with this! As a very penny pinching mom of 2 I love that I will be able to get so many uses out of this! My favorite to date! I am beyond excited to use this every day! Noticing improvements to the texture of my skin already and my hands! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I tend to get very dry skin on my face during the colder months and am always on the look out for great moisturizers. This product has my attention! A little bit goes a very long way and it absorbs quickly which is great because I am normally in a rush and hate the wait time in between using a facial moisturizer and being able to put on my makeup for the day. It has a clean scent which I also love! I have some smile lines and can't wait to see if this starts to make a difference. I just started using it and I'm already loving it!

"Make up counter moisturizer you can get at the drugstore! L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer has become part of my evening routine every night. It leaves my skin feeling smooth after cleaning and using the RevitaLift Serum. After just a few weeks of use my skin looks better than ever. My favorite part is, the moisturizer doesn't leave my skin oily or sticky. When I get up in the morning my skin is in much better condition too. I will be trying more of this line and adding it to my daily routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Good and cheap I've been searching for a self tanner that won't make me look more yellow because I'm Asian and my skin is pale and has a warm undertone so I'm already a little yellowish bc I'm asian and even more yellow with olive undertone. So it's really hard to find self tanners with a red undertone which this one has. It doesn't make me deep dark as its name but I'm 2 shades darker with only a little bit of yellow tint when with other self tanners I have tried that people claim are amazing makes me way too yellow or orange to go in public. If it works for a rare case like me, I'm sure it will work with everyone else. It doesn't cost much at least it is worth it to give it a try."
Scent is Refreshing L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer Is an amazing product. When I first applied this product I noticed it was so silky to touch and went on so smoothly. The scent was refreshing and not too strong. Normally my face stays dry especially this time of the year but after applying the moisturizer my face stayed soft and hydrated all day and night. Even fine lines seemed to fade. I will keep using this product and will be recommending it to friends and family. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Amazing product for dry skin I think the L'Oral Paris recitalist triple power DEEP acting facial moisturizer is an amazing product! I have been using it consistently for the past two weeks and have seen amazing results! I like that you only have to use a little and it goes a long way! The texture glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly so it does not leave an oily or sticky residue. Although it may be a little expensive I think it may be worth it since it seems to last a long time even with daily use. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"I really like this one I have only used this in combination with the facial serum, however, so far I like it. I feel like it rubs in evenly and well with out too much work. It leaves my face feeling super soft and it doesn't feel heavy at all. The first couple days my face felt more oily to me, but after almost a week of wearing it now morning and night, that seems to have went away. I really like it a lot, and even though it is part of a set this is the one I would most likely keep using daily, or at least every night. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Sexy Smooth First, I gotta say I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT! When I first recieved this is was super excited and wanted to use it right away! After applying it to my face, neck, and jawline, I was already impressed by how smooth the cream was and how soft my skin felt. I use it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. I apply it after the L'Oreal Revitalift Concentrated Serum and immediate results. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone and im most definitely going to keep using it!

"Left My Skin Silky, Smooth and Younger Looking I have sensitive skin and in the winter it gets very dry and itchy. I need a moisturizer that is not going to irritate my skin even more. I loved that LOreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer worked great on my sensitive skin. Not only did it leave my skin silky smooth but it also helped reduce the appearance of my wrinkles. I love that the cream is lightweight, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling firm, hydrated and glowing. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Surprisingly lightweight I believe that L'Oral triple power DeepActing Moisturizer is true to it's name. I used this moisturizer in conjunction with L'Oral triple power serum and together they made magic on my face. I chose to use it at bed time because I truly wanted to test the product and give my honest opinion with the effects of makeup. I was mostly impressed at the non greasy and lightness of the moisturizer. My face looked and felt hydrated in the morning, so I know the product worked. This is a definite win for L'Oral. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Face Felt Smoother Than In A Long Time This moisturizer is amazing! I can't remember when my face felt this smooth. I kept feeling the smoothness of it during the day in disbelief. My biggest surprise was that it felt this way from the first day! Talk about fast-acting! Here in Florida the sun and salty air can play havoc on your skin, but this product seems to counteract that. I spend a lot of time outdoors and am glad to have this in my life now. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Life changing This hydrates my skin perfectly, so much so that I don't need my face cream. If you have oily skin, it might be too much for you. After two weeks my wrinkles are smoothed out, my skin is more even and my makeup goes on super smooth on my former rough patches. The smell is nice, clean and crisp. I highly recommend this, especially for those looking for a good product on the cheap. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Amazing product! This is the first moisturizer that actually lasts all day! I love it! It goes on smooth and feels great on the skin. It doesn't feel greasy or heavy either, like most moisturizers I've used. Also, I've noticed a lot of moisturizers have an annoying fragrance, but the fragrance on this is very faint and quite pleasant! The lotion actually tingles a bit when you put it on, so you know it's working! You will not be disappointed with this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Cream The L'Oreal Revitalift Cream is such a wonderful product. It is very easy to apply. You dip your finger in the cream and apply with fingers on face and neck. Immediately, the face feels soft and smooth. After a couple hours, my face looks clean, bright, and refreshed. It even felt soft. For me, it is really hard finding a perfect face cream that doesn't harm my sensitive skin. This product has really improved the quality of my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great color I've used this product for about a week now, and I love it. After the first two uses (first day) the streakiness went away, so I guess that's just a beginning thing. I've noticed a significant change in the color, my legs finally match my arms. I wore leggings basically all year before using this product for a week. My only sour note is that when the bottle says to use sparingly around the ankles, do it. My ankles were a little dark, but the color lightened up with a little bit of body wash and a luffa. The smell, isn't bad, but it isn't great. I would suggest some kind of coconut or tropical scent to be added. I'm fairly impressed with the scent as it is though considering most self-tanner smell like acid."
"Love This! The L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is wonderful! It comes in very nice packaging - a glass jar with an easy to unscrew top. The moisturizer leaves your face smelling very nice and very soft. I have not noticed any extra grease on my face from this new product - which for me - is wonderful! I'll keep using it for a while longer and re-review then in case there are any changes. Overall, a great product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great product I absolutely love this. I never tried it before I'll be loyal to this product. My skin is smoother than ever before. It's also like a primer, my make-up stays on perfect throughout the entire day! Now onto wrinkles, they've diminished a little, but then again, it's only been about 17 days, but it's more progress than with any other brand! All-in-all, very happy and would recommend this product to anyone! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This is a Must Try I am always a skeptic when it comes to moisturizers. Will it leave me with red skin Will I be greasy Even worse will it cause breakouts Well I can definitively saw the L'Oreal Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer doesn't causes any of those worries. This cream is gentle and light and leaves my skin refreshed and glowing. I couldn't be more in love with the Triple Power Products!! Run out and try them for your self. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great product line What a great nighttime moisturizer. It is recommended to use the serum right before the moisturizer after cleansing. I have never felt a product so lightweight on my face before until now. I have tried other products and they made me feel like I had a mask on so I would take it off shortly after. I can finally use moisturizers every day and night without the heavy feeling, greasy feeling. I hope to see even more results in the next coming weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Hip Hip Hooray!!! What can I say, I am in love with this Moisturizer!!! It's silky when you put it on, it makes my skin feel dewy and soft. I love the way my dry face feels smooth and supple. I can see a huge difference after using this moisturizer for a short amount of time, already. I do use this twice a day. Living in the harsh heat of Arizona really dries my skin out and this product is working like a miracle. Yep, I'm a fan for life!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smells lovely. I don't use a lot of different facial products as their strong perfumy odour bothers me. This skin care regimen has a soft subtle scent that enhances it's use. There was excellent hydration noticable after using just 3 days. I not only used it on my face, but on my forearms so I could actually see the improvement without looking in a mirror. It reduced the crepiness and made my skin taught and younger looking. I will be buying this product in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Amazing product! Been using for a week now and am so impressed with how well it works! Hydration and beautiful skin are something that is high on my list of gotta have! Being a mom I need something that is easy to do and in just minutes I am able to complete a routine that makes my skin supple and radiant!! I use the matching serum with it as well. I do recommend you buy all the products to work in tandem with each other, amazing products!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal paris revitallift triple power deep-acting I received this product a little late due to travel, but have been using it for the past couple of days. Here are some of the things that I really like about it so far: 1. Goes on smooth 2. No Stickiness 3. Nice smell to it. 4 . A little goes a long way I can't wait to see if I continue to using it will it really improve my aging. It does seem like my skin has a nice glow to it. More to report back on after more use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Awesome Sauce!!!!! I usually have big problems with moisturizers adding this oily/shine to my face that is absolutely not wanted. This moisturizer doesn't do that. It really sinks into your skin and doesn't disturb your make-up application. And, it is also amazing when I use it at night without make-up. I have combo skin (oily/dry) and I will continue to use this product after this campaign. It's awesome!!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice moisturizer I use the L'Oreal Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer every evening before going to bed. A little goes a long way, and it applies easily. My face feels moisturized as soon as I put it on, without that sticky feeling. What really impresses me is how my skin looks and feels in the morning. I wake up to really smooth, soft skin. This moisturizer works well on my slightly sensitive skin. When I don't need a sunscreen product, I'll be using this in the morning too to keep my skin looking good. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"just make sure you are careful... the lotion works good and has a nice scent, just make sure you pay attention when applying it around your ankles and knees.....just like they say, it will make those areas extremely dark, making them appear as though they are dirty"
"My dry skin thanks you, L'Oreal. This is a great moisturizer. I've used this product twice a day for the past 3 weeks along with L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Day Lotion Moisturizer (Broad Spectrum SPF 20). It has a very subtle, pleasant fragrance and I can already see and feel an improvement. I'm looking forward to seeing how effective it will be during the coming winter months when I seem to have even more dry skin issues. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Two for One! The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is two wonderful products in one. Living in the humid Gulf Coast with oily skin, it has always been a challenge for me to find a product that truly moisturizes and balances my skin without the weight of a heavy cream. This stuff does the trick! It absorbs quickly into the skin giving you a smooth hydrated surface for applying makeup without it settling into fine lines or wrinkles. The overall tone and texture of my skin has improved. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Impressed by this moisturizer! I think this moisturizer has been the best by far that I have tried! I really enjoyed how it didn't make my face feel suffocated. I'm not one to use moisturizers on my face daily or often, but once I tried this and started to get into a routine, I was able to tell the difference on how it made my face feel. It didn't feel as dry and oily like it normally does. I really liked the scent too, it was not over powering and it feels light weight when you apply. I definitely recommend! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Spa quality Moisturizer I used the moisturizer after letting the serum soak in a bit. The product was so creamy and spread so smooth. I believe the product would last a fair length of time because a little goes a long way. The moisturizer made my skin feel so smooth and hydrated. I also believe that the wrinkles on my face are not as deep and it seems the small wrinkles are smoothing out. I would absolutely recommend Loreal revitalift. It is a high quality facial product.

"Excellent Moisturizer I am amazed at how well L'Oreal Triple Power Deep Moisturizer works. From some medications, I recently have had to deal with dry skin. No matter how much moisturizer I used, it was never enough. Trying this product the first time, I was not sure that it would be any different then the others. I could feel putting it on, how different it felt. It is not heavy, feels good and certainly works better then any of the others I have used. Already had compliments asking if I was wearing new makeup. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Feels like my face took a BIG drink I LOVE the feeling this moisturizer gives my face upon application. The results say that you will immediately feel deeply hydrated and that is exactly what I felt. I have really dry skin, especially in fall and winter, so this was like a large glass of water after a long walk or run. I am anxious to see what my skin feels like after a week. One thing to note is that the moisturizer has a mild fragrance of flowers (slight rose smell), but it is tolerable unlike other over powering moisturizers I have tried. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great moisturizer I will admit I am a face care product hoarder. This moisturizer isn't my favorite but it is up there. I've been using Loreal Deep Acting Moisturizer for about 2 weeks at night along with the other two loreal revitalift products in the package. This moisturizer is so rich creamy and yet blends and sinks right into my skin. With winter colder Temps coming up I'm looking forward to keeping ahead of dry winter skin. This has made the complexion of my skin much more even. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great Moisturizer I'm always on the search for a good moisturizer and the LOreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is one of the best moisturizers I have tried. I have dry sensitive skin and this moisturizer is very hydrating and doesn't break me out. I think it works great to wear under my makeup and helps hydrate my skin so my foundation doesn't crack or dry. I highly recommend this product! I also like that it is available in drugstores so it will be easy to replace when I run out ! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"This stuff is a lifesaver! I have been using L'Oreal Paris' RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer for almost two weeks now and my skin has never felt better. I have naturally extremely dry and my job leeches every bit of moisture out of it. I've been applying the moisturizer every morning before work and at night before bed and the differences are astounding. I gave up on facial moisturizers years ago because they were far too greasy, but this Deep-Acting Moisturizer is perfect for me. My face is now softer and feels like new! I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great for my neck I've used this on my entire face and find it very moisturizing, but what I like best about it is that I can also use it on my neck. The skin on my neck is very sensitive and often turns red whenever I use moisturizers on it. I have been having to use a particular hypo-allergenic moisturizer that is pretty expensive just because at age 61, I know I have to use something to fight off the wrinkly neck. I was amazed that the Deep-Acting Moisturizer has already made a difference in the way my neck looks and hasn't caused the redness and burning I was afraid it might. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great texture Goes on smooth, absorbs quickly. Makeup applies well over it doesn't get greasy thru the day. When used at night it feels luxurious. The fragrance is a bit strong, but not overpowering. Would prefer unscented. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Meets expectations... I wanted to tan my legs from sandal area up to my upper thighs. Decided to follow the suggestions, so showered and shaved my legs before using it. After drying off, I applied a moderate amount and applied it with both hands making sure there weren't any areas that had it thicker than others. It worked fine. On one later application, I was rushed so left off shaving until a couple hours after applying this, on the basis that it would be dried off enough. That was a mistake, because along with the little whiskers came a lot of the lotion that had been turned to a gunky consistency. Also, because of the rush I didn't have time to make sure it was applied totally evenly, and ended up with a couple streaks which were embarrassing. As long as you apply this after you have shaved any areas as normal, and then take the time to apply it evenly - even to the point that you gently stroke the area again a few minutes after finishing the application to make sure there are no thick spots left - it works. Take care to not put much at all (if any) on areas of dry or hard skin, such as areas of feet and knees, elbows, etc, because they will end up darker than the rest. This works fine. I think I was right to pick this before a darker tan, and apply a couple times, because it looked much better, much more like a real tan and less like something out of a bottle or tube. The lotion itself made my skin noticeably softer for a few days afterwards, so that was a lovely bonus. I could do without the fragrance, but it's not totally unpleasant."
"Hydration at its finest! I have been using the deep acting facial moisturizer for 3 days now and I am more than happy with the results already! I moved to California from the south a few months back and my skin started to dry out terribly and loose its glow and became dry and dull. This product has made my skin glow again! The scent is very pleasant and even my husband likes it, He says it is very clean smelling and also its very light weight and not oily at all for my skin. I will be purchasing this from now on! I normally use Lancome and the price comparison with better results have sold me! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A great moisturizer! I am very impressed with the RevitaLift line of products. When I put the moisturizer on, it feels like my skin is soaking it in. I do have to say that the fragrance, while pleasant, is almost too much for my sensitive nose. I could see how others might develop a headache from the scent. I haven't had to use any other moisturizing products since using this one, and my favorite thing is that several days I haven't even bothered with concealer or foundation because I feel it has helped my skin tone look more even. I would definitely purchase this product again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Looking soft and smooth. At first I thought the smell was too strong but after trying Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial cream, the smell fades to a subtle smell that leaves just enough scent to smell great but not gross out those around you. My normally dry patchy face is smooth, soft, and my dry patches are gone. This cream is very thick, so it might not be great for those with oily skin. But for me, it is a life saver. I have only used this product for one week and I see a major change with my skin. I found a keeper. I have already recommended this product to my girlfriends. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Finally a product that works! I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for a little over a week now and I am so impressed! I used it after i washed and cleansed my face before bed and when I wake up in the morning my face is so smooth. This makes for an easier makeup application in the morning. This product goes on smooth and absorbs fast into your skin with no sticky after effects. My skin felt so moisturized! I definitely recommend this product for people looking to smooth out their skin and moisture their face. Plus it smells great! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"My new favorite night time product I have found my new favorite night time product. This stuff is amazing. My skin has never felt better. I wake up with soft skin whereas before I would have dry patches or an excess of oil. Not with this stuff. It is the perfect balance for my skin. I haven't been using it long enough to notice any real big changes, but I am noticing that my skin does appear a little softer, and maybe a little more even in tone and texture. I can't wait to see what it will have done after a month or two of use! Good job, L'Oreal! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer Love the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, I didn't wanna post my review before I test it for a week or more 10. Days now using it for morning and night before sleeping for my face and neck .. and I love the result, feels my face and neck more soft and moisture and clear.. Love the fact it doesn't feels greecy or oily and have nice light smell.. didn't needs long time to feel the difference.. took couple of days and felt my face is shining.. comes in attractive design box and bottle.. definitely recommend it..

"Like putting silk on my face I've been using Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for a few weeks and I love the way it makes my face feel. I love the subtle scent and that it doesn't leave my face feeling sticky. I've always had dry skin which leads to breakouts but since using Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I've had almost zero breakouts. (I had one but that was due to falling asleep with my makeup on) I'll definitely be buying more when I run out but because you only need a small dab for your whole face, I doubt that will be anytime soon. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I don't have to moisturize all day anymore! I have extremely dry skin and I have always had to moisturize my face multiple times a day because the moisturizer I have been using wears off. I also have sensitive skin, so I have to be very selective about what I buy to use on my face. This product is like nothing I have tried before! For about two weeks before I started using this moisturizer, I had really dry patches starting to come up on my face. Within three days of using the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, they were gone! I will never use anything else on my face. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A very nice moisturizer The moisturizer is easily my favorite of what I received in this buzzkit. It has a thick, but not goopy feel to it, and it absorbs quickly without feeling sticky. I definitely feel like my skin is softer after using this for just a couple of days. The issue I have is that it's part of a routine with several steps, and it's just more than I can handle. I don't wear makeup, and usually just wash my face with water and a wash cloth. Having to use a cleanser, serum, moisturizer, and day cream in order to achieve the promised results is a little much. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I think I am in love! I have been using all the products for three days. On the first application, I noticed a slight tingling of the serum and the night cream. The next morning, my skin was still very moisturized, unlike other products that I used. I then cleaned my face with toner and noticed a slight exfoliation which I was surprised that it was already working. The day lotion is nice and lighter than the night cream and, along with the serum, makes for a perfect canvas to put your foundation and other makeup on. I am going to continue to use it daily and she what kind of results I get, but I am very impressed with the products to date. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love It! This product does not have the usual smell of so many sunless lotions and I love that about it. The color comes out very natural looking although you may have to apply a couple times to get a good noticeable difference depending on how dark you want to look. I will be buying this product again.
"I am loving this product! I've been stuck in a wholesale warehouse sized packaging rut of facial care. Then this campain came along and made me take a break. I am so glad it did. I don't wear make up and fall/winter can be harsh on my skin - dry, flaky red patches on my face. While using the serum and deep acting cream, I've noticed a huge difference. No dry patches, even skin tone, no redness and even less wrinkles ( or just maybe not as deep). I am loving this product and will continue to use it, even after this sample is all gone! Now what do I do with my leftover other brand moisturizer Any takers This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"RevitaLift is Amazing!!! I absolutely love this product! I've been using this line for about 3 weeks and the results are awesome! I noticed immediately after my first use how soft it made my skin feel, it's non greasy and absorbs very quickly. The smell may be a tad bit strong for some but I love it. It's very citrusy, kind of reminds me of fresh grapefruit. I use this twice a day and I have 24hr softness. The lines around my mouth have started to fade. My dark spots and blemishes aren't so noticeable now either. Overall I love this product and would recommend it to anyone looking to combat the early signs of aging.

"L'Oreal Paris is AMAZINGLY I am an African American Middle Age women with very oily skin, just recently I start trying a product that my dermatologist prescribed for oily skin and acne prone skin. This new medication left my skin very dry and I have tried multiple moisturizers to help relieve the dryness. The majority of them, I tried left my skin Feeling or Oily all over. Until I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Moisturizer. This moisturizer left my skin feeling clean smooth. My skin didn't appear to be full of greasers or oil. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who is using acne medication-and need to keep their skin hydrated. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Soaking Up the Moisture! I have been using the serum treatment and deep acting moisturizer in the morning and at night. My face has never felt this smooth or soft. I look forward to treating my face and neck to this regimen before I start my day and at the end of my day. The moisturizer instantly soaks into my face and makes it feel smooth. A little goes a long way. I also love that the moisturizer does not leave my face greasy or cause my face to become oily as the day progresses. I love both the serum and moisturizer, and plan on making both part of my daily routine. My face looks brighter, smoother and feels incredibly soft.

"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power regimen Step Two I used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer as the second step in RevitaLift Triple Power regimen. I apply the moisturizer around my eyes first then spread out evenly over my face. After 4 weeks of using the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer along with the Facial Serum I have noticed that the wrinkles around my eyes are very faint and seem to be disappearing the more I use it. My face looks so hydrated and revitalized. My face is soft, smooth, and silky to the touch. I am very pleased and will continue to use L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Power regimen.

"I love it! This is one of my favorite facial creams. I love the texture. It's thick and smooth. I have a very dry and sensitive skin. So I have to be very careful with the products I use. L'Oreal RevitaLift Moisturizer feels very nice on my skin. It provides the desired moisture and calms my skin down in addition to smoothing wrinkles out. My skin feel very fresh and tight. I also like a lot the fact that it doesn't tighten the skin too much. In my opinion this is an excellent cream for women in the 30s. I apply the cream after my evening shower, and after the RevitaLift Serum Treatment. Results are amazing! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My new go-to moisturizer I have high hopes for this products from L'Oreal. It would be great to find an affordable product that works. So far, I am liking the mild scent of the lotion. The lotion does not seem to be too thin or too thick as some tend to be. My skin does not feel greasy after using it. I tend to get a little redness with new products but so far, not much of a problem. I have only been using for about a week, so I cannot yet comment on how it will affect my fine lines, wrinkles and enlarged pores. I am hoping for some good results as I have spent tons of money just in the last year with only slight improvement. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So surprised. I think this is one of the best moisturizers I've ever tried. I have dry skin year round,and this really surprised me. I've tried a lot of moisturizers before,and they usually made my skin feel somewhat oily. They just didn't really feel great at all. This product went on smooth,never felt oily or sticky. And it made my skin feel great,so soft and refreshed. I feel like even when I wear this everyday,it never feels oily,and my skin isn't flaky at all anymore. I highly recommend it to anyone who has really dry skin and wants an overnight change. That's how fast it worked for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Luxuriously Silky Smooth I only recently received and started using this moisturizer and already see results! It is very concentrated and rich, so you only need to use a small amount after applying the serum each evening before bed. It doesn't feel greasy or too thick, and it has a very feminine, light fragrance. I am a 61 year old female with some sun damage from my sun-worshiping days, but already my skin is looking more hydrated and an almost youthful glow. My husband (who usually doesn't notice anything!!) remarked that my complexion looked great! I am DEFINITELY sold on this series of products!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
So far so good! I got this product for my mom. She is going through treatment for breast cancer and one of her big complaints is about how dry her skin is. She also complains about wrinkles and spots so I thought hey..let's give this a shot. After one day of use she could already tell a huge difference in her skin. It was the first day she talked about how soft her face felt instead of how dry it felt. This made me very happy since this is such a hard time for her. :) I will be back with more reviews after she's been using it longer!! But if the start is any indication then we are going to love this! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"good prodect Very effective, If you'r light complexed like I am, it gives you a tan that last about a week"
"New favorite moisturizer! I have tried many moisturizers over the years, and Loreal Paris Triple Power ranks among the highest for me. There is no need to reapply throughout the day, as the initial application leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day long. I have been using the product for 1 week in conjunction with Loreal Paris revitalift serum, and both products have been just as described. As the packaging claims to see younger looking skin and increased elasticity after 4 weeks, I cannot attest to the results. I can say that in my 1 week of use, the overall texture of my face is indeed smoother! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Received today Day 1(PM): Triple concentrated serum had a smooth feeling on my face, absorbed thoroughly and left a non-greasy feel, has a pleasant scent. Followed by deep-acting moisturizer which had a thicker consistency than the serum but also very smooth and absorbed well into my skin. My skin feels Uber moisturized and non greasy, so far I really like the product!! I will update after 1 week of daily use and at 2 weeks. What I would like to know before buying: the size of the products is awesome, not the tiny jars most companies sell for lots of . The scent is not over powering and it's totally NOT greasy:) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My new best friend I think that the L'Oral Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer is nothing short of AMAZING! I live in Iowa with lots of weather changes..sun, wind and COLD! I have never had a facial moisturizer that doesnt feel like you have a mud pack on! This L'Oral Deep Acting Moisturizer is light and just disappears as you put it on. Not greasy and feels so good on your skin! I ride my motorcycle ALOT and windburn is a frequent issue, this has been the only thing that has helped! Not to mention I'm 40 and fine lines and wrinkles are starting to fade :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Noticed A Difference Wow, I didn't realize how much I loved the Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer until I went away on a 3 day business trip and forgot it! I've been committed to putting this on my face every night for almost 4 weeks now. Usually I wake up refreshed and with glowing skin. Well, forgetting my lotion on my trip was a big mistake! My face felt like it was lacking something, appeared dull and I just didn't look as good in the morning. I could not wait until I got home to start up my regiment again. Is it wrong that I think I missed my lotion more than I missed my husband....! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Sharing the news Had some neighbors over for lunch yesterday. Always looking for and learning about new products we have tried. I told my neighbors how amazing this deep acting moisturizer is. Yes, they have tried many before. I showed them how good it felt on my face and let them try for themselves. There is nothing better than feeling a product before you buy. I feel this is a superior moisturizer with great results. I love that it absorbs immediately and is not greasy. I am looking forward to hearing from my neighbors how much they see a difference after buying LOreal This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"For Men TOO! When I received my Triple products in L'Ore,al Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment,L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF, my husband wanted to know what it was and what it was for. So I told him it smoothed out the skin, evened out the skin tones, helped with fine lines and wrinkles. He was like I want to try! So after a week, he said that he could see a difference, that the lines on his forehead were smaller and he really loved this! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great nightime moisturizer I really enjoyed using this moisturizer. I'm a bit of a skincare and makeup snob and usually stick to mid to high end brands. I think this is a really great product, especially for something that you can get at the drugstore. This consistency is a little thick and very moisturizing but didn't leave me greasy. It sank into my skin very quickly and my skin was soft to the touch. I haven't had any breakouts from it either. I've only been using for a little while so it's hard to judge the different it's made in my skin but I do think it's on par with many higher end moisturizers. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Intense moisture This moisturizer pairs great with my morning and night routine. At night using only a mild soap usual left my fave feeling and looking dry. After only a day using this moisturizer not a dry spot in sight! My skin feels baby soft and refreshed. After applying loreal serum I then apply not even a dime size and it covers my entire face and neck! A little goes a long way with a nice mild fragrance my face feels clean all day and night long. With the seasons changing and winter fast approaching this product will be a staple for me that keep me feeling smooth all day thanks Loreal! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great moisturizer I recently turned thirty and have been trying to find the product that works for me. I have tried several different products that have made my skin break out. The jar is very high end looking and a great color. A little of the moisturizer goes a long way. I have tried different products that made my skin look greasy this product made my skin look very dewy. This product superseded my expectations. My skin tone and texture has changed. This product has helped me used less foundation because my skin looks great. My blemishes are almost gone and I am so in love! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"L'Oral is brilliant with this triple action moisturizer! I have been using this product for a little over a week now, and it's simply brilliant. My skin is bright , less makeup being used, fine lines are lighter and harder to find. The smell of this product is light but wonderful. Moisturizer looks thick in jar, but is thin when applied and doesn't leave a greasy after look or feel. Simply leaves skin hydrated and brings great comments from people on how natural and un-flawed it makes my skin. Out of many jars of moisturizer I have tryed, this product is rated 1 for my skin. It's a must try product, you will love! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"good product Great value, works great"
"Clean-feeling moisturizer I have always had dry skin and have needed to moisturize my face multiple times throughout the day so I wouldn't feel so crunchy. I've struggled for years to find something that does the job well and doesn't make me break out though. Within the first day of using the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, I could tell I was going to love it. It kept my face moisturized all day, break-out free, and didn't leave me feeling like there was a residue on my face like so many others have. To top it off, there is also a slight sheen to my face as well so even when I'm make-up free, I still feel like I can go out and feel good about how I look. I'm definitely a believer!

"Aging skin has met it's nemesis! I have to be extremely careful about what I put on my skin as it is very sensitive. This moisturizer has worked incredibly well for me. It moisturizes without leaving you greasy. I haven't experienced any issues with sensitivity and my skin has noticeably improved. I'm almost 50 and my skin has gotten drier with each passing year, so it's nice to find a product that moisturizes without any negative side-effects. After using this for a couple of weeks, my husband actually asked me if I was wearing make-up (I usually don't) because my skin tone is more even and it has a healthy glow. The fact that my husband noticed is the best review you can get in my book:) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Really like it! I started using L'Oreal's Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer about two weeks ago. At age 68, I'm lucky not to have too many wrinkles, but I do notice sagging skin on my face, so I've been looking for something that can make my facial skin firmer. I'm pretty sure I've found it in this product. I've been using it twice daily, once in the morning after my shower, and I apply it again before I go to sleep. The great thing about it is that it's not greasy, and it absorbs right away. After two weeks of constant use, I'm beginning to notice firmer skin and my face doesn't feel as dry as it was. Great product, and I'll continue to use it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Rich soothing cream I have been using 3 products together. The serum, the day moisturizer and this Triple power deep acting Facial moisturizer as directed on the boxes. I really like that you only need to use a small amount of the facial Moisturizer. I feel this product covers very well and absorbs quickly without out leaving a tacky feeling on the face. My skin feels great and even using all 2 of the products, I don't feel like there is too much on my face. They seem to work together very well. Now that this campaign is over, I will probably continue to use the facial cream at night only. It will replace another product that just didn't feel that good. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Couldn't ask for more! I don't usually wear a lot of makeup because every time I have used a moisturizer, it makes my skin feel oily. And without a moisturizer, my skin is very dry. It's been very hard for me to find that perfect balance. I have finally found it in the RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. At first, was a little suspicious because it doesn't look or feel different form any other brand I've tried when first putting it on, but within an hour, I knew I had found my match! It perfectly moisturized my face without making me feel oily, and it lasted long enough to keep my feeling moisturized all day. It the perfect balance for me!

"This stuff is amazing!! I used this moisturizer along with the serum and SPF 20 daily face lotion and I have to say this this deep-acting moisturizer is fantastic!! I've been using the product every morning and evening for a week now and I have to say that I can already see the difference in my skin. This moisturizer is so thick yet when I apply it, it feels very light weight. When they say this moisturizer is deep-acting, they mean it. My skin has never been softer and smoother!! The scent is also very nice!! My skin looks amazing...soft, smooth, glowing, fine lines are fading. I can't wait to see my results after 4 weeks. This product is a game changer!!! Highly recommend!

"This cream makes my skin very happy This cream was a complete treat for my dry, thirsty skin. It has a gorgeous, springy texture that applies like a dream to the skin, and works wonderfully under makeup, despite how moisturizing it is. I think thats because it sinks into the skin rather than leaving a film on top. I love how it leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day long, which I cant say about many products. It also works wonderfully as a night cream, and that would probably be enough for most skin types. For me, twice a day is perfect. A little bit goes a long way, so this jar should last me a long time, meaning you get a lot of bang for your buck. I cant recommend this highly enough! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Skin feels great! I am shocked at how much better my skin looks and feels already! The lotion is very thick and creamy so I was a little worried it would break my face out but it hasn't at all! It does not feel heavy on the skin and dries quickly. I like to light smell, does not smell chemically. I have been using it in the morning and at night and within a week my skin felt completely different and I could see a difference around 2 weeks. It takes a very small amount so it should last a long time! It is definitely something I will add to my daily routine from now on along with the concentrated serum and SPF lotion. They definitely work great in combination. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Luxury in a Jar! The first thing I noticed about L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer was the gorgeous jar! It has the look of something you would find in a high priced boutique. Nor was I disappointed when I opened this lovely little jar. The product itself has a luxurious creamy feel and a rather pleasant scent that is feminine but not overwhelming. The experience only got better from there. When applied to my face, this moisturizer is neither heavy nor greasy. On the contrary, it is like pure silk on my skin and leaves my face feeling soft and supple all day long. I am so in love with this product and how it makes me feel! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer This cream can be used day or night, and it's sufficiently thick to be moisturizing, yet it absorbs very quickly. And my skin was left very smooth afterwards. The packaging is gorgeous a high-end looking glass jar in a rich red color, bronzed lid. All shaping up to be a very good choice for a moisturizer. It is easily absorbed by my face without leaving any greasy traces. As this is such a rich cream, I have only been applying it in the evenings, about half an hour before going to bed to give it a chance to get totally absorbed. My face feels soft and hydrated in the mornings. I find it a bit too rich for my skin for day use This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Banana Boat Self-Tanning Lotion Was glad to find the product online because it was sold out out the 2 wal-mart stores that I checked. I use it on my legs year around to keep them from being so white.........
"Moisturizing never smelt so good I think that Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer works great! You can feel it start to work when you apply it to your face! I have very dry skin and i usually walk around with red cheeks and dry skin on my face but not this fall no mam i have no wind burn or dry spots at ALL on my face and I have just used it twice . Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is not greasy at all i love that the Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is lightweight and doesn't feel like i have smeared vaseline all over my face to beat it all it smells amazing , i give the new Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer 5 star rating !

"Triple protection I basically restarted my daily routine and added in a seem which I've never used before. Initially, I was very excited to try them all and got myself back into the routine. I liked the cream and moisturizer because they were not oily or slimy, very easy to apply and had almost instant results. My skin feels softer and smoother after using them and I feel like my skin is getting extra care and protection. I don't have bad wrinkles or age spots yet, but I like the idea of preventing them and I have confidence in this product. The serum was new for me but I feel like it did it's job and helped to really clear up and heal my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This was my favorite moisturizer I have normal skin, but I was able to use this moisturizer morning and night! I love how although the suggested use was nighttime, it was light enough to use as a daytime moisturizer after applying the Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum. This product also replaced my primer. I use a stick foundation and this non-greasy moisturizer worked great and did not cause my make up to run. It also delivered results as the package stated it improved my skin texture and minimized fine lines after one week. It smelled nice and was not too heavy throughout the day. I live in Southern CA and the weather has been very warm lately, but I had no problems with this product even after sweating. I can use this product year round. I will purchase in the future.

"Will buy again!! I am 38 yrs old and have noticed a loss of firmness in my skin on both my face and neck. I also have always had a lifetime problem with oily skin and breakouts. I was concerned how my skin would react to this product considering what a heavy, and fragranced lotion it is. I'm very pleased with the results I've seen, especially on my neck, as it does appear more firm. Even though the cream is thick, it has not caused my skin to break out or have any negative reaction. The fragrance, however, can be a bit overwhelming and some people may be sensitive to it in those regards. I would have preferred a lighter, more absorbable formula in this line but will definitely will still repurchase as to maintain the increased firmness I've noticed in my neck!

"Such soft skin!! This is my mom. She is going through chemo 2. Her skin is very dry. Before the chemo she talked about wrinkles, but not so much anymore. So when I had the chance to try these products I knew she'd be perfect for it!! She said her skin hasn't felt this soft in she can't remember how long. It looks and feels smoother and she has noticed a change for the better! She has used it for just over two weeksthis is her before (left) and after (right) pics so far. I can't wait to see how she feels as she continues her treatments! The regiment is morning and night and I know that was hard for her because she gets very tired these days. But she did it. Once she realized how much it helped with her dryness she didn't want to miss any days at all! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So far so good! I received my kit yesterday afternoon. After washing my face last night I put on the serum and moisturizer. Both had a very nice light fragrance. The serum applied very smooth. The moisturizer is very thick, so a little bit goes a long way. I don't like lotions or creams that feel heavy once I put them on, so thankfully this moisturizer didn't feel that way. My face felt soft and moisturized without the feel of my pores not being able to breath. This morning after showering, I put the day lotion on. Again, it had a nice fragrance. It have my face the moisture it needed without feeling too heavy. I also LOVE that it has added sun screen in it. I will update my review once I use it for at least a week, but as of now, I think I'm really going to like this set. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Really like this moisturizer! I use this cream in the morning as a daily moisturizer for three weeks and I really like it. I have slightly dry skin and am at the age where I am starting to see very fine lines that don't always go away after a good night's sleep. This moisturizer makes my skin look very smooth and dewy. The consistency is light and it goes on nicely. My skin almost seems to drink it in. A small amount gives very good coverage. It has a light cosmetic scent that is not overpowering. Once I apply it in the morning, it feels like it last most of the day unless I wash my face again. I wear light daily makeup and haven't noticed and problems with wearing this product underneath. I also like the packaging. It is attractive and looks nice on my dressing table. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Super soft I think that the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is AMAZING! I have been using it at bedtime for about 2 weeks and I love it. I'm prone to dry spots on my face. Since using this moisturizer, I haven't battled those dry spots! I was a bit skeptical at first because it is a heavier moisturizer. In the past, my skin has become greasy and has even broken out when using a thicker cream. Not so this time! It is quickly absorbed but not in a way that I feel like I need more on right away. It also has a pleasant scent that is not overpowering. As for the product's claim to diminish dark spots, I haven't noticed a difference yet. But, I do love the texture of my skin after starting to use this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Very moisturizing. I tried this for the first time last night after applying the Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum. This moisturizer has a nice creamy, but not too greasy texture. It absorbs pretty well into my skin, but I do still feel it there throughout the night. This isn't necessarily a bad quality. The only concern is the scent. It doesn't seem strong when applied, but I could continue to smell it for hours. This could be too much for those sensitive to fragrance. Since this cream is thicker than my usual Alba oil-free facial lotion, I am worried about break outs. If that doesn't end up being a problem with my acne prone skin, I would consider purchasing this product . My face continues feels soft and moisturized the morning after using this cream.

"Love this moisturizer! I've been using L'Oreal's RevitaLift Triple Power Deep acting Facial Moisturizer together with their facial serum and SPF cream for about a week now and I love it. I have very sensitive skin and so far have had no ill effects. The moisturizer is light weight, easy to use, and my skin is very soft and hydrated. The Moisturizer used together with all 3 L'Oreal products doesn't cake on my skin or make my skin feel oily or flaky to touch. It only takes a tiny amount to cover your whole face and neck which is perfect because the bottle is big enough to last a while. It even works with my regular facial cleanser without any problems. My skin looks fabulous. You definitely have to try this product. I'm excited to continue using this Facial Moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smooth and rich! Sunless tanner can honestly be hit or miss but I can honestly say this product is right on the money. It comes out with just enough color to see where you're putting it but not too much that it's going to come off on anything, it's moisturizing unlike most tanners so you won't be cringing from dry skin, the smell isn't offensive and the price is really good compared to other tanners. Once it develops it's a really nice natural color with no streaks. I love this product.. Two thumbs up :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer Works Wonders I have been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer after the LOreal Paris RevitaLift Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment for little over a week. I am amazed by the results. My skin appears to be fuller, hydrated, and radiant. But, most of all, the wrinkles upon my forehead, especially around my left brow which is often raised by itself, is filling in. Plus, the other day I had to take a double takethe scar on my throat wasnt as prevalent. The skin quickly soaks in the product. There hasnt been a need to reapply during the day, just one in the morning and once at night. My old skin has never felt so soft or looked so much younger. I cant wait to see what the results will be in 4-weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My new go-to night cream I'm in love with this lotion that I can use day or night. I use it primarily as a night cream but when I'm feeling the day needs some super hydration I can put it on for day use as well. It goes on smooth and absorbs nicely. I appreciate the dewy complexion it gives me before I go to bed. I have not noticed any new break outs while trying this, in fact, it definitely has a calming affect on my skin that can be break-out prone. I had some acne scars above my eyebrow and they are WAY less noticeable. I believe it has also improved my skin texture. I am pairing it with other RevitaLift products and I really am enjoying the entire line up, they work nicely together and I am excited to see what the long term affects will be!

"You can feel it working in minutes!! So far On day one with in minutes of using both the L'Oral Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment and Triple Power deep acting moisturizer I am pretty impressed. First let me say a little dab of each goes a LONG way!!! Which is great because the product will last you a little bit, which being on a budget is amazing! Second it makes your face and neck incredibly soft, radiant and looking refreshed. And Last but not Least so far I could feel the skin around my eyes starting to lift and tighten. My only complaint I have is it took me a few minutes to figure out where the directions were, I wish they would have put them on the back of the boxes instead of the side! I can't wait to report back in a few days on how it is going! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal Paris Revital Lift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer This moisturizing cream is awesome! I have been using it daily for about a week or so now and I love it! I am a 46 year old woman and I have a dry face when I get out of the shower. I always use moisturizer on my face right after my morning shower. What I like about this day cream is that it is non greasy and non sticky. Some days I do not wear any make up, and some day creams leave my face looking greasy and not even washed. I do not like that, but this cream does not do that to me. I put it on, it sinks right in and you can't even tell I am wearing it. I can tell that I am wearing it though, because my skin is not dry or tight, it is left feeling soft and smooth! I will continue to use this for many years to come!

"I Love L'Oreal's Revitalift Product Line! I was given the opportunity to try 3 of L'Oreal's Triple Power face products: the Facial Serum Treatment, the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer and the Facial Day Lotion. I am so excited that I tried these products. Before trying them my face was so dry. Nothing I had tried really worked, yes other products added a little moisture to my face, but you could still see the dryness through my makeup! I tried all 3 of these L'Oreal products together. First the serum, then the moisturizer and then the day lotion. The first day I used these products my makeup looked amazing!! The next couple of days I wore no makeup and my face felt so soft and moisturized all day, not oily and definitely not dry. I continued using these products together every morning for a week, then I skipped a few days and didn't use any of them and guess what My face was still very soft and moisturized! I love these products so much that I bought 2 more L'Oreal products, a cleanser and an eye treatment, to use daily with the other 3 L'Oreal products. I know that these products are also intended to help with wrinkles, but I don't really have any yet. Hopefully, these products will continue to keep my face wrinkle free as well as soft and moisturized! Thank you L'Oreal for making some amazing products!!!

"You will feel the results overnight The weather is getting chilly, so the air is getting dry which is why I appreciate a great moisturizer I can wear overnight and wake up to soft supple skin. L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift moisturizer is a really fabulous night cream. It's thick but not too thick, creamy and when applied it sinks in nicely with leaving a sticky filmy feeling behind. It's lightly scented, so if you are sensitive to fragrance, you may want to keep that in mind, but it's definitely not overwhelming, and fades quickly. I do use this in conjunction with the serum from the same line, and they work really well together. A multi-step skin regimen is something I have taken on to start taking care of my skin before it shows any signs of aging. This is formulated to treat deep wrinkles, but I'm in my late 20's so I don't really have those signs of aging, but I do think there a value in using this product before you truly need it. The price is right and it's readily available so there is no downside. I would stick to keeping this as a night cream because without sunscreen you are missing a key component in skin care. Overall my impression after using it for a few weeks, is it's great moisturizer that will having you wake up with soft skin if you use it consistently. Overall, great buy.

"Goes on smoothly, non-greasy I tried Loreal Paris Revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer for free through a bzzagent campaign. So what did I think of it Well, I've tried many moisturizers over the years, and I pretty much know what I like and dislike pretty quickly when trying a new brand of moisturizer. I like that this product smooths onto my skin easily, and doesn't leave me with a greasy feel to my face. I can't stand products that feel greasy, so it passed that test. Next, it works well to moisturize my face. We're heading into dry skin season where I live, and my face gets very dry. I've tried many products that just don't seem to leave my face feeling moisturized over the course of the day. This product really did, though. It soaks in really well, and just leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Revitalift I loved it. showed an improvement in my skin.
"Rich and Thick Moisturizer! L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer (1.7 oz) works very well! Right away when you open the lotion and dip your finger in the well the product feels very rich and thick, not watered down or thin to the touch. This product does have a slight fragrance but I love it. If you do not like any type of fragrance in your skin lotion, this product may not be for you. I have only been using this product for a short time now and I definitely feel the results in my skin already by repairing wrinkles, re-firming your skin and redensifiying. The elasticity in my skin does feel better after using this product. Keep everything in mind about this product I would definitely recommend to a friend! **I received this product thanks to BzzAgent and L'Oreal Paris in exchange for my honest opinion** This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Smooth Face Feeling Great Product, costly for my taste"
So smooth This has to be the smoothest creamiest lotion I have ever used in my life.Know I can't live without it
"Really works! I've had issues with sensitive skin and acne for as long as I can remember. I was worried it would burn, or make my acne worse, or even make my face feel really greasy. It didn't do any of those things! After using this product, my face feels so hydrated, smooth and soft, and it feels tighter than before. While my face doesn't feel much less smooth, I definitely notice a difference if I forget to put this on. I haven't worn makeup for about 5 years now, and my face has always looked slightly red to me. Since using this product, I've noticed that my face no longer looks red, and my skin tone actually looks even for once! I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants their face to look and feel younger, softer, and wants an even skin tone, even those with sensitive skin! You won't regret it!

"baby soft skin I've tried this for 1 week and my skin feels baby soft, everytime after I've used it. **L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer (1.7 oz)** Goes on smooth with a light scent. You don't need a lot of lotion, it goes a long way. I like to rub any lotion left on my hands on them. they feel soft and smoother. My Halloween makeup looked flawless when I used underneath. I looked and felt younger also. My mother noticed a nice change in my complexion. I would recommend buying this product even though its higher than I would normally pay for price wise. It looks like it will last a long time before buying a refill. ****special note: rinse hands well after use. My cat Buddy didn't approve of the smell when he came over and sniffed my hands after I was done applying it.**** This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Works Great! L'Oreal Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer is amazing! For the past two weeks, I have been using this moisturizer every morning and night as part of my facial rituals. Right after I clean my face with my usual facial cleanser, I applied the moisturizer to my face and neck. The first thing I noticed was that it had a very nice gentle fragrance. After applying I could immediately feel how smooth my face felt. After using it for two weeks, I can see a big difference in my face in that but only is it MUCH smoother, but I have a nice healthy glow. Normally This time of year my skin is SO dry and flaky, but after just a day or two of using this amazing moisturizer, the dryness decreased, and now after two weeks, my face actually looks hydrated! Amazing product highly recommend! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My cranky combination skin looks happy! I've always had problem skin, with hormonal acne and combination areas. For some reason, moisturizer has never been on my radar. A few years ago I went to a dermatologist who told me that my skin would balance out if it had more moisture. I tried this product with the hopes that she was right and it looks like she was! I still have the hormonal acne, but my face looks calmer and definitely more hydrated. I love the creamy texture of the moisturizer and I feel like I'm pampering myself before bedtime and then again in the morning. On days when I was going to be outside I alternated using the Day Lotion instead of the Deep Moisturizer before my makeup in the morning. The glass jar is sleek and sophisticated. I will definitely repurchase this collection when I've used it all up. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"My new favorite! This L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is my new favorite face cream of all time. I am 75 and I used to use L'Oreal skincare products all of the time and loved them in fact they were all I ever used but at some point I stopped using them. Obviously at 75 I am going to have some issues with my skin, personally I think that I have pretty good skin for my age but this cream really did tighten my face up really well and I think that my wrinkles and fine lines look so much better! I love every single one of the products that I was sent but this one is definitely my favorite and I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for some tightening and filling on the skin with lots of moisture! This for sure compares to my high end products. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Product! I have been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for a few weeks. I use it in the morning before I start my day and at night after my long day. I must say this is the BEST facial moisturizer I have tried. It doesn't feel greasy at all, and the 'hydrated' skin feeling lasts all day for me! I use it once, and the fresh feeling lasts for HOURS! I don't need to reapply an hour or two later. My skin feels and looks smoother already! The scent is light and fresh also, that is a huge plus! I have already recommended this product to a friend of mine dealing with dry skin due to the cooler weather. The price is a little higher than other facial moisturizers, but you are getting what you pay for. A little of this stuff goes a LONG WAY! It's worth every penny! I give this product 5 out of 5 stars! It's awesome! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Smooth I love this product because it leaves your skin very smooth and moisturised. You can really feel the hydration is going deep in you skin. It really works. Thank you.
"Skin Wonder Moisturizer This is the most wonderful product ever! After using, I can notice the difference in my skin. My skin is flawless and supple. Loreal has the most awesome products!!"
"Moisture, Moisture, Moisture! I don't have that many wrinkles as yet but I don't want to wait for more to show up to begin working on them. If you are like me and is looking for a daily moisturizer that has the benefit of younger looking skin, then the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is for you. This product should be used in conjunction with the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment but alone, it is still awesome. If feels think and creamy between my fingers but goes on smooth and light. It leaves my skin looking and feeling well moisturized. The moisture last all day so I don't have to reapply. I live in a warm climate so I spend a lot of time outside and I thought this product would make my face oily but it does not. Overall, I really enjoy this product and will continue using it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love it! I really like this product. It's a tinted lotion so it makes the application process much easier and less streaks or missed areas. Great color too!!! My only complaint is how splotchy it is between the applications. I do exfoliate daily and maybe that is why but I also have eczema. It just makes it difficult to enjoy it like the rest of the consumers when I have to wait to apply it. I highly recommend this product though.
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power - Your face will thank you! I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer in conjunction with L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment for three days and I'm amazed how different my face feels already. I have fairly dry skin that is also sensitive to harsh products so I am always a little nervous to try something new. The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer has a smooth, light application that doesn't irritate my eyes like other potent moisturizers. It does take a while to fully absorb into the skin, which is recommended on the bottle, so I waited before adding anything else to my face. I applied it in the morning and in the evening after cleaning my face. My face feels hydrated and silky smooth. My hands even seem to benefit from it as well! While both products state that they fight wrinkles, I can't say that I have seen a different in the wrinkle department yet, although, I only have two forehead wrinkles to monitor. I highly recommend L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer to anyone looking for smoother, youthful face! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Don't Spend on Department Store Moisturizers Please! I have tired dozens of brands of moisturizers -- Lancome, Estee Lauder, Elizabeth Arden, L'Occitane Devine and L'oreal products. The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer has the same effect or even better results for me. The moisturizer is rich and thick but doesn't feel sticky at all. I love the fact that it feels rich and expensive. I also love the way it goes on my neck and chin. I've been using it everyday since I've gotten the product and I have noticed a smoother texture to my neck and chin. I also use it as a moisturizer in the morning. I put it on after I wash my wash then I have my breakfast. I then put my makeup on and go to work. It can also act like a makeup base because it makes my foundation go on smoother and my skin looks very polished and professional. I don't think I'll use anything else.

Fantastic product Fountain of youth for a 63 year old. You can see the difference in less than a week. Fewer wrinkles and more toned skin. Definitely a keeper!
Works amost like magic I'm amazed how well it started to soften the wrinkles and in such a short time. I think I've finally found the best moisturizer for me!!!
Best Moisturizer Ever!!!! I am 63 years old have never found a moisturizer i love more. Am so glad this product came out and I will buy it for the rest of my life!
good experience very convenient
GREAT Moisturizer Got this as a sample in a magazine and had to have it. Smells wonderful and has my skin looking and smelling amazing! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Non Greasy facial Moisturizer. Has to be L'Oreal! I think that L'Oreal makes many fine products. L'Oreal ReviaLift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer is definitely one of them. The moisturizer is creamy, but not too thick. That works well since many serums that are thick, cause breakouts. No fun! I had no break outs, just well moisturized skin. The daily environment is harsh on everyone's skin, that is why a moisturizer is essential. The bottle is great, shaded the way a good skin product needs to be, since many ingredients lose potency with the light. I liked this product because it moisturized well and it was easy on my skin. The cost is priced right and the L'Oreal brand has had a good history of products with me. I would buy this product for moisturizing. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Best Moisturizer Ever! My face is either super oily or really dry....or even a little bit of both!! If I use lotions and moisturizers they typically make my face break out and become way too oily. I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power deep-acting facial moisturizer for two weeks now, applying both day and night, and I must say that it is amazing!! It's a super light moisturizer and it leaves my skin feeling like satin. Another positive is thag doesn't break my face out at all. This product is enexpensive and just a little dab of it goes a long way, which is amazing for those on a budget! It has helped my dry patches around my nose and cheeks and my skin feels and looks hydrated and glowing!! I must say I am hooked! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Perfect to use under makeup L'Oral does it again. I'm obsessed with their skin products. Mainly their anti aging facial creams and serum. Revitalift Triple Power is awesome! It is so rich and luxurious and akin to high end skin care products. A little dab covers so much and leaves your face feeling very moisturized. I always feel like I have a youthful glow when I wear L'Oral facial moisturizers. I think I know why! If you open the container it looks like the standard cream colored cream. I rubbed a little bit on my hand and it dried down to a very subtle sheer iridescent color. The glow! It looks amazing under my foundation. That dewy, highlighted look is in now. Score that I'm following a trend and also fighting wrinkles! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
so far so good. I usually tan good in the tanning bed and sun but ive been short on time and the tanning bed isnt healthy so i was on here reading reviews and decided to go w/ this one.. i was really iffy about it but i was willing to give it a try.. the first day i used it and it says u will see results in 2-3 hours..i felt like i could but it might have been in my head.. so later that day i put more on and my family was saying i looked darker.. when i put it on a make sure im careful about it so it doesnt go on uneven and stuff.. and it seems to do really good.. the only thing is watch really dry skin..like on the top on my big toes they are really dry and i put it on them and u could tell it looked awful but i just stopped putting it there also it has a slight greasy feeling but its not horrible..and i was working out w/ it on and where i sweat like on my arms u could see it looked like i was dirty but i took a shower and it went away.. but i really do like it.. im just throughing out the warnings .
This was a moisturizing experience I gotta say I was impressed with this moisturizer! This cream was a whipped cream for your face. It was not oily at all. Nor did it have a strong scent. After washing and a serum my skin feels pretty dry and when I applied this I could feel my face absorbing the cream. It's a really nice night cream but I must admit I used it in the morning as well under foundation and my face felt hydrated all day. Not greasy just soft plumper skin! After approx a week of using my skin felt softer and less dry after washing . I must say I will purchase this on a regular basis. I really have enjoyed using it and actually noticed a difference in my skin after a short period of time. LOVE!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"L'OREAL ROCKS I love L'Oreal products and have my entire life. When I found out I got this mission I was ecstatic. Each product is wonderful. When I first opened this product the smell was the first thing I noticed. It smells rich and it smells effective. But wait until it goes on your face. Your skin just laps it up and thanks you by looking fresh and relaxed and younger. I just know that this product works for my skin and face, and I love it. Anti aging is what it is all about these days. The population of baby boomers is huge, and we all want to look younger. I am constantly seeking products to give me a boost. To get rid of wrinkles and sagging skin. L'Oreal Revitalift is the product for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'ORAL PARIS REVITALIF TRIPLE POWER I wanted to thank bzzagent and L'Oral for sending me this product. I wanted to waite 2 weeks befor I did this review...can I say amazing!. I tired the Revitalift triple power day lotion moisturizer spf 20,Deep-Acting moisturizer and concentrated serum treatment. The serum is the first step when you apply the concentrated serum which is used for a day and evening second step is using the concentrated serum treatment which that is for day and evening as well and third is the day lotion which is only use for in the morning time. This product is very different from any moisturizer that I use before it is non-greasy and absorb to my face very well. I can see the difference once I apply it to my face and brightens it up. Just a few dab on the face to smooth out every morning and evening. It feels like that I don't have anything on my face and the finish is very smooth and a light fresh smell. I have notice a difference after using this for two weeks and I seen a difference in the reduce of fine lines that started to appear under my eyes. this will definitely reduce overtime and my skin looks great. I recommend and to try these products out. Being a woman specially over 30 you always want to look your best and feeling younger so I recommend any women to try this out. You will not be disappointed. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Fountain of youth in a creme i wish that someone would have told me about this when I was 30 something. but that's okay , even at 59 i look like I'm 30 something. I get compliments all the time about how great my skin looks and people don't believe i'm almost 60"
"Thick and creamy The Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer was followed by the serum and was equally smooth in texture and was pleasant in smell. It was a thick consistency and I felt it truly moisturized my skin throughout the day without leaving it greasy. I was especially pleased with the way my make-up applied after I allowed the moisturizer to soak into my skin. My foundation glided on without caking up, which I have not found to be the case with other moisturizers. I cant really speak to the anti-aging component, since it was used along with the serum, but I believe the two products together made my complexion more balanced. I have a normal skin type, not dry or oily. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
A lot of moisture Have used other products with no real difference. This seems to alow my skin to retain the moisture better.
"If your are looking for a great face lotion here it is I think the Revitalift triple power day or night is a great product . Ive used it for about 5 days and I apply it at night only. I think it's made my skin smooth and vibrant . Everyone compliments me on how youthful my skin looks lately . I think it's cuz of this great reliable lotion. My face feels so dry coming out of the shower but my skin instantly feels hydrated when I apply the Revitalift face lotion. I can even see a my skin brighten up as soon as I apply it. I also haven't had no problems with applying the face lotion then applying a spot cream for my breakouts , seems to be working great together . I think my skin looks younger and fresher since using it and the results were fast . I have no complaints and I think you would love this product especially if your looking for a quick boost in vibrant skin. Two thumbs up This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Pleasantly Surprised! I have tried all kinds of serums, mainly high end deluxe samples from subscription boxes. I have to say that I'm loving the L'Oral Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. I am 40, and though luckily I don't have any visible wrinkles yet, I want to keep it that way. I have very dry skin, especially in the winter time. I also have something called sebaceous hyperplasia, which is tiny little bumps on my forehead and on my cheeks right next to my nose. Nothing seems to make them disappear totally. This serum, in combination with the other L'Oral RevitaLift products, seems to take care of both of those issues for me. My face feels so soft and smooth and I have noticed a reduction in the bumps. My one issue with this line of products is the scent. While the scent is pleasant, I would have preferred it to be unscented. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loving the Results I never realized how much I needed to start using anti aging products until now. Each day and night I have been applying the Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and the difference is very impressive. This product has made such an improvement of the elasticity of my skin and not only is my skin extremely moisturized but I have noticed a lot less wrinkles and fine lines. Even the daily dark circles have lighgtened. I have used other facial products in the past but never had the dramatic and amazing results as using Revitalift. This product comes in a classy glass holder and with just pea sized amounts used on my face, jawline and neck this product is bound to last quite awhile. The feeling of it is amazing without the greasy uncomfortable feeling I have had with other products. The scent is very pleasant and light. I really love the benefits of this product and intend on continuing to use it. Without the risks of plastic surgery or other procedures I am quite happy to continue to use Revitalift instead. Not only is it affordable but it is also a great product that will allow me to age gracefully and confidently without the dreaded aging signs. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Rich Moisturizer I really love this luxurious facial moisturizer! I use it in the morning and before bedtime. I really like that my face feels so hydrated and very soft. I apply it on my face, neck, jawline and on the back of my hands. I am 57 years young and truly value the ingredients in this product. I like that one of the main ingredient is ( Pro-Xylane to stimulate collagen that we loose while aging and that this wonderful facial moisturizer replenish facial volume and has Hyaluronic acid to help fight wrinkles . I love the wonderful scent it has. I will continue to use because so far I really like how it feels and how it keeps my face hydrated and radiant. I have noticed that the first time I used this product my facial skin had flaked a bit but that happens because of clearing off the dry skin and beganing to repair. Love it!!

"Good, but bad. I have a really good tan on my upper body so when I decided to wear shorts I didn't have a Tan so I wanted to get one fast so I could wear shorts and start to get a real tan.IT REALLY IS STREAK FREE!!! the only bad thing about it is, i would put lotion on my feet ankles knees before i put this on because it made my knees feet and ankles look a bit dirty. But other then that it's perfect. The first time i put it on it really didn't do much at all but the second time i put it on then went to bed when i woke up I had a really nice tan, natural looking and no streaks at all. Plus it didn't leave my palms looking orange or dirty either. I apply it 1 maybe 2 times a week. The smell isn't bad at all, and if you have really dry skin then I would mix it w/ some regular lotion too."
"mamaw user I could instantly feel the skin firming up. You have sold me, keep doing what you are doing"
"Erase Aging w/ L'Oreal paris RevitaLift As I get older I am starting to see the signs on my face. Unfortunately that means wrinkle and lines that I don't like so much. So I have started trying out some ageing products. I recently tried out L'Oreal Paris's Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer and I really like it. It feels great on my face, soft and silky it's almost like applying a spa treatment at home! It works great on my face. I feel more moisturized and hydrated after I use it. My face feels so much healthier. I love the way it makes my face feel. I can see a difference after only a few uses. My lines and wrinkles are firmer and less noticeable. I really enjoy the texture of the product, the smell is great, and it feels amazing. I am very happy with it. I received this item for free for my opinion. All opinions are my own.

nothing makes my skin feel better I love this product as it makes my skin feel wonderful!
"L'Oral face I need to say that I'm 35 and live in Illinois. It's the beginning of cold weather, does alot of damage to my skin. I also am a waitress which then my skin can get greasy! This product couldn't be more spectacular. THe picture is of me with no makeup! The product itself is smooth and just thick enough that it has an everlasting feeling of hydration. The scent is an inviting and calming effect on me. MY skin is losing redness and becoming a beautiful tone as if I'm in my early 20's again! I believe this is a miracle cream! HANDS DOWN, the best I've ever put on my skin. IT will not leave your skin greasy but yet a soulful feeling. It won't leave your skin begging for more hydration either! Every morning and after I wash my face and I love my skin thanks to L'Oral products even their makeup! Bravo and thank you for the chance to be one that gets this and gets to promote it!

L'oreal I have been using this cream for about 3 weeks and like it very much. It seems to do everything it is advertised to do and I plan to continue using it. I am about ready for another jar.
I feel the difference I have been looking for a great mositurizer that wasn't heavy or oily and would leave my skin feeling soft and looking radiant. I'm very impressed by the quality of this product and the results have been amazing! My skin is feeling/looking noticeable smoother and supple.
"people have already said i look younger! at first, i wondered if this was jus going to be another moisturizer. i was surprised! i followed directions. went on smooth, not greasy. really seems to enhance my skin more than any other product i've tried. i have cancer (so prob cant afford to buy more ( )"
"Gave me a dewy complexion Now that I'm in my mid 40s I'm always looking for products that make my skin look younger. RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer glided on my skin. After using it every night for a week, I'm waking up to a lovely dewy soft complexion. I love it."
"Pamper Your Skin I decided to try the Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer late one night and was quite skeptical about whether I would actually be able to see any difference to my skin. I was pleasantly surprised to see how easily it glided on my skin. It has a rich, creamy texture and after using it for a week has given my mature skin a radiance and glow that is unbelievable. The texture of my skin has totally changed and the few fine lines that I had are disappearing with each use. I was so excited about the new smoothness to my face that I decided to try it on my elbow. I am always propping my head on my hand and as a result my elbow gets rough. I have tried every lotion imaginable and still it was rough but now I'm happy to say that my elbow is now as smooth as the skin on my face. This moisturizer will make your face more vibrant and younger looking the more you use it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"So much moisture! This is by far my favorite of the three Triple Power products I am trying...which says a lot considering I really like the other two! I have been using the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer at night after applying the Concentrated Facial Serum. The smell is subtle and it leaves my skin feeling soft. If you look at my picture below, just that much covers my entire face, which means, that little bottle (compared to some other brands) is going to last for quite awhile. Who doesn't want to stretch their dollar and have a great facial product! You definitely want to rub it in well and give it a few minutes before lying down on your pillow or it might feel a little sticky at first. I really liked my previous night moisturizer, but this product has not only moisturized my skin, but actually improved how it feels to the touch. It looks like I will be switching to a new brand! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great product I am one of those who has to try the next new thing. For all of those products, I have to say that I've only say long term change with the Olay Regenerist. Easy to get and afford. 5 stars is a miracle product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"In LOVE! I love this self tanning lotion! It's simple, quick and easy to apply. I usually don't like to use Tanners with a guide color or tint because it settles in my pores and I get those dreaded brown speckels all over, but the tint in this lotion looks great and doesn't settle in my pores. I've always used sprays and always thought that the application and results were the best. Until I tried banana boat deep dark lotion and found the application a piece of cake, especially since using gloves is a pain and stains your hands with most lotions, but banana boat easily washes off palms, way less hassle to apply than sprays, and, for me, the color is much more natural and the color stays true longer before any obvious fading. I'm a convert!!"
Lovely I requested a 5 day sample of Triple Power and was so impressed that I went right out and purchased a jar. It absorbs into my skin so nicely and does seem to lift. I saved one of the day smaples for my mom to try. I think she will really like to too.
"I'm addicted to this The L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple power deep -acting facial moisturizer is a cream that I never want to be without again. The little jar it comes in looks and feels like luxury, and the product within is much better than anything I expected. The cream is rich and smells good, it's moisturizing without making my feel oily and gunky. I love using it in the mornings, and again at night before I go to bed. My skin just drinks it up and loves me more for it. My partner who barely notices any changes in my beauty routines cannot stop complimenting in how nice my skin looks and how good I smell when he comes to kiss me minutes after I've applied this. My skin definitely is getting more youthful I'm so happy to continue using it. I have recommend it to my mother who is in her early sixties. And after trying it out for a couple of weeks, she has only positive things to say! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'Oreal Continues to Create Better and Better Products I must begin my review with the disclosure that I have been a L'Oreal fan from the days when L'Oreal was a department store brand. I have purchased this moisturizer in this line in the past. I liked it very well, but I did not realize how combining the products would increase the effectiveness of the moisturizer. The texture is gentle on my skin and has a bit of immediate tightening effect which I rely like. The scent is light and lovely. It absorbs into my skin and does not compete with the different perfumers which I wear on a daily basis. This is one superior product. As the headline said, L'Oreal continues to produce better and better products. My face feels silkier for having used this item. Thanks for asking me to use and review this product. Girls, go out and try this. It will be worth every dime I spend on it. I would never have known to combination these products! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Moisturizer I received a sample of this moisturizer and I have to say I love the way it felt on my skin. This moisturizer is light, non greasy and a little goes a long ways. My skin felt smooth, moisturized and looked healthy. I used it at night and day."
Wonderful I really like the way RevitaLift made my skin look and feel. I seen results in the first two days and I like the results a lot. I have told my friends all about it. Thanks
RevitaLift Wonder! What is not to like in this product. I saw results as soon as I used it! It really moisturizes my skin without leaving any residue. I will absolutely continue to use it.
"Triple Power Healthy Skin I have a very pale complexion with extremely sensitive skin which leans towards the oily side. Finding products for my skin has been a difficult and expensive process. The cream is thick and smooth with quick absorption into the skin. I would apply the L'Oreals RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment before applying the moisturizer. After using the both products together for just a few days I noticed that my skin felt drastically smoother and softer to the touch. I am usually prone to break-outs when using new products, but this product did not cause any problems. In addition, there was a more even tone to my skin with a healthy glow that I didnt expect. The only downside is that it has a very strong fragrance (especially if you have allergies or are highly sensitivity to fragrances). Overall, I would say this is a great product if you want to replenish, revitalize and keep skin looking healthy! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Review- WOOHOO At first I was like wait I have to do what My next thought was well is this going to make my face look all shiny and greasy I can tell you that it doesn't. I used the L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer after using the Facial Serum. This moisturizer rubs right in leaving your face feeling soft. It is seriously the softest my face has ever felt. I am not a person who would spend a lot of money on a product that i wasn't sure would work. However now I will for sure be spending the money on these products and recommending them to every other person who is looking for good facial moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and this didn't affect it at all. I would also say that after using it I felt like my skin was tingling but in a good way. This is going to be a great moisturizer especially in these Midwest winters we get. It will help to continue making my face soft and smooth. There isn't much of a smell to it which is also a great feature. I don't want to be putting on perfume smelling lotion, especially at night. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Luxurious feel I've tried a lot of moisturizers and this one seems just as good as creams that are twice the price. It's got a nice smooth creamy and luxurious feel to it, absorbs quickly without feeling greasy. I've been using this morning and evening for two weeks, so far I haven't seen any dramatic effects on the wrinkles but the texture of my skin does feel smoother."
"Very Soft Skin After a two days, my face felt softer. I am pleasantly surprised with the results of L'Oreal RevitaLift. The 3 products are - L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer - L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment - L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 The basics...all 3 products are smooth and creamy with a light scent and absorbed quickly and completely. The 2 products with a pump dispenser dispense about the right amount of product. I also noticed that the L'Oreal products didn't make my face sweat like many products do. I know it is a weird thing, but my face sweats after applying most moisturizers. I don't know what is in the products to do that, but the 3 RevitaLift products are different. So far, I'm happy with the 3 RevitaLift products and am glad that I was able to try these products for free because I wouldn't have tried them otherwise. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"no streaks as long as your careful I have been using this product for over a year now. It has worked very well for me, plus it doesn't rub off on your clothes as long as you give it 15-20 min to dry. As long as you rub it in very well it won't come out streaky, and if you apply it to your knees, elbows, ankle, or face use it very sparingly or mix it with regular lotions to prevent orangeyness. Also if you have light colored skin defiantly DONT think about getting the dark lotion instead of the medium one to get a darker tan. My friend decided to do this and her whole body turned an ugly dark orange color."
"Amazing results the first 2 days!!! I'm a side sleeper and I had a deep groove on my right cheek. Nothing has helped it. I'm 54 and really looking for products that work. In less than 2 days, I was looking in the mirror and there was not a sign of this deep groove that was 3 inches long in a weird spot on my right cheek. i wish I would have taken before and after pictures. I'm buying all 3 products in this line. ladies, IT WORKS!!!"
"Found my favorite night time moisturizer! I absolutely love the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer! It's worked wonders for me, especially combined with the serum. I use this at night after I wash my face. I wake up with soft and glowing skin. I've searched high and low for the perfect night cream/moisturizer with the benefits I need and so far, this it it. It's not too heavy of a cream, which is important to me. It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy at all like some products. Which is also important to me since I'm prone to breakouts. It's very moisturizing and my skin looks very healthy since adding this to my routine. I'm very excited about using this with winter coming up, I get dry patches in areas of my face and I think this will end that. My skin looks more youthful and fine lines are less noticeable. My eyes, my forehead, and around my mouth look much better, you can really tell a difference. I highly recommend adding this to your routine. You can probably do away with a lot of other products you use to achieve the same result with just this and tell serum! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great product ! Could be cheaper A plus
"Excellent and Rich Moisturizer I have combination skin and most moisturizers either are too heavy, leading to breakouts or too light, leading to dry patches. For me, L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer is just right. I've been using it for two weeks as my night time face cream with great results. The product comes in a jar and has a deliciously creamy and rich texture that feels luxurious on my skin and absorbs quickly. I had a small laser burn right on top of my lip that had been peeling and red for a few weeks so I was a bit worried to try the product. I am happy to report that not only did the cream not affect the burn it immediately helped it. Right after the first application the burn stopped peeling and became less red. I was convinced then and there that the active ingredients in this moisturizer truly moisturize. I have also noticed that my skin is softer and more supple. Two thumbs up for this cream! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great moisturizer!!! I have combination skin, with a slightly oily T-Zone, so forehead and nose area and then dry cheeks and chin. I've struggled to find a facial moisturizer that works to combat the oilness and yet still hydrate the dryness. After using L'Oral Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer in the morning and evening after washing my face everyday for a week I definitely noticed a more even skin tone, minimized pores and a smoother, tighter appearance. I found that when I applied this moisturizer before my make up it really complimented my appearance, making it look more natural and my make up also came off more easily when I washed my face in the evening. I found it to be pleasantly scented with a non greasy feel unlike other deep moisturizers and the glass jar it's packaged in gives it a luxurious feel. I am definitely impressed by the results of this product and will continue to use it in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Outstanding Results I started this regiment 3 weeks ago and every week I see improved results. I am amazed with the results of the L'Oreal regiment. I used 3 products together and saw results continuously. I used a combination of L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment, L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Moisturizer with Sunscreen. First of all the scent is amazing, fresh and clean smelling. My skin feels so smooth and moisturized. I've even noticed my make up going on better since using these products. I can't rave about these products enough. I have always been picky about my moisturizers because I don't like the greasy feeling some leave behind, these definitely leave my skin feeling light and fresh. If you're on the fence about trying these products definitely take the leap and go for it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Sweet (face)Dreams I used the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer only at night and all by itself. I tested this as part of L'Oral's beauty trifecta -- three amazing RevitaLift products. My morning routine consisted of two of the others products (Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment Facial Day Lotion SPF 20). Those were really enough for each day, but I wanted something a little heavier at night. My wish was granted with the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. I apply the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer at night before bedtime and in the morning, my skin looks great. Gone are the dry eyes and blah skin. My face looks and feel well-hydrated and fresher each day. This lotion is just a little bit heavier than the other two, which is why it is perfect for nighttime use. It applies smoothly and easily and is not at all greasy or messy. This is really a jar of magic. I won't go to sleep without it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Moisturizer My face is usually pretty dry, but after a week of using this cream along with the Triple Power Facial Treatment I am noticing that my face isn't as dry and already feels smoother. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
great moisturizer I have some pretty dry skin on my face.. this really helps to moisturize and keep my skin nice and soft!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great color on pale skin! I'm very pale and use the Deep/Dark shade and it gives me a natural looking tan....no orange color!! I haven't had any issues with streaking. I do use a self tanner mitt to apply. Does have a slight smell but not horrible.
"Wonderful little tub of silky smooth goodness I think I'm in love. I have used the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer every night since I got my kit. I use it after I wash my face (with soap and baking soda) and use astringent. The astrigent dries up all the oil and breakouts but the Deep-Acting moisturizer makes everything smooth. My face is so soft after putting this one. It sets in and drys completely, quickly. It doesn't crumble off or peel. It doesn't make my skin itch or burn. It smells wonderful and did I mention how soft it is It's really really ridiculously soft. I find myself rubbing my cheeks after. It comes in a 1.7oz tub that will last a while. You don't need much it goes a long way. You can use it morning and night! I love this stuff. Really love it. I have not noticed an improvement in skin complexion or tightness yet but I've only been using this product roughly a week. Change takes time. But I can most definite see myself using this product for a long time. It is absolutely worth a try. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Great product This is a great product. It feels great on my skin and does what is states it should. It helps to fill in my pores. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Love This Stuff! This is the best sunless tanning lotion I have ever used! It dries fast and is not sticky at all. Gives me good color even after just one application.
"Smooth and lovely Aside from the fact that this cream comes in a ridiculously bulky, probably unsustainable, jar (I imagine so that you feel like you're getting more for your money), it's really excellent. There's a nice smell but not so perfumey that it makes me sneeze, and your skin feels nice and clean after it's on. It's thick, so you don't need to put very much on at all, just maybe a pea-sized drop under each eye and another on your forehead. The directions recommend using the cream morning and night, but I prefer a lotion with an SPF for daytime, so I've only been using this at night. I do feel like my skin looks nice and soft and fresh in the morning, so I'm happy with it."
"Soft and smooth. Due to my combination skin, I have a hard time finding facial products, but after using this moisturizer my skin feels soft and smooth. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Fabulous Facial Moisturizer! It has been very difficult to find a quality moisturizer at a good price point, but L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer has found a new customer! Just a little dab goes a long way, dries quickly and doesn't leave a sticky or greasy feeling. More importantly my skin look brighter. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This stuff really works! I have used this cream for several weeks now, and my face feels great! My skin is fabulously soft and smooth! Will want to continue using this cream at night because the results are amazing! The scent of this cream is light and fresh This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Very light on my skin I tend to stray from using moisturizers because they make my face feel heavy and oily. However I am thrilled with L'Oreal! A user for life! Even with the day lotion on top for added sun protection my face feels clean and pure. Amazing! Not only am I losing wrinkles and brown spots my face is soft and protected. What a win/win! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Deep Moisture This goes on very smooth and I wake up to the softest skin in the morning. I love the thicker, whipped consistency of this moisturizer. It does not cause my pores to clog thus no breakouts for me. Just very soft, glowing skin. I look forward to doing my new facial regime. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Smooth on my face I am 38 and super concerned about the appearance of my skin. I have fair skin with freckles and not everything works well on me. This not only feels great on my face but I felt almost a glow about my skin when I tried it. A little goes along way which is great to not have to buy products every few months. I love the smell of it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Deep moisture This product is a deep moisturizer. I have tried many that felt oily or heavy. This product gives my skin the same treatment but with a lovely soft texture. My skin feels and looks more youthful and firm. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Deep mosturizing lotion I love this product. I just turned 31 this year and have definitely notice the change in my skin. From fine lines to dryness this product helps them all. I love the scent and the texture of the cream. I would recommend this for anyone looking to restore their fresh face back to the day when kids, laundry and dishes ruled your life!

just received this I'm in my 40's and thought that I would never use anything to help take away my wrinkles but after having a grandchild I figured why not try something . I love the way it makes my face feel after applying it . I would recommend trying it . I'm sure you'll love it to. It's not greedy or anything like I had expected it to be. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"BETTER THAN MOST...... I've tried many self-tanners, and for me this beats most. Cost effective, and more important, it works. I've learned to mix a little body oil rather than lotion with this. Smooths on beautifully, dries quickly, leaves a better scent, and gives me the color I want. I use Jergens Shea dry body oil. I also use a body scrub and hand soap on my hands afterwards. No orange. I probably use this between two to three times a week to keep a good color. Banana Boat is BY FAR MUCH BETTER THAN LOREAL SELF TANNER. Did not like the results. Very weak color. Try this...I think you'll like it."
this is so refreshing I love this moisturizer! I have dry skin and always find it hard to find a moisturizer that works all day long . I have been using this product and have no complaints my face feels moisturized all day long. I have received compliments on how healthy my face looks. This is a must have.

Loved This! I loved these products. I used the Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer and the Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment. These products have left my skin smooth and soft. I could feel the difference right away. I could see the difference after three days. It's light and non-greasy. My make-up went on smoothly over it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I used the L'Oreal facial moisturizer each day and my skin is so soft and silky. The first day I applied the moisturizer it absorbed into my skin immediately with no greasy feeling. Each day I felt my skin becoming softer and softer. I loved not having the greasy feeling after application. I was expecting to be greasy like other products. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Review of RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer I love this product. I have been using this moisturizer at night after using your cleanser. I used to wake up with dry skin patches on my face but have not had that happen since I began using this moisturizer. My skin feels so smooth, much better than any other moisturizer I have tried. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Moisturizer I love the L'Oreal Paris Moisturizer. It left my skin feeling soft . The nice thing was that it did not make my skin feel oily. I have pretty sensitive skin so I worry that my skin can become irritated from new products. This however, did not bother my skin at all. I can't wait to see if it tones my skin up. I recieved this product for free to leave my honest opinion. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"smooth product Been using for a week and I can't believe how smooth my skin feels. Also starting to notice a little tightening. Looking forward to seeing results in a few more weeks. So easy to use glides on not heavy feeling at all. Used morning and night, lightweight. Important to me might be to some but wanted to let you know the container is easy to open.

"My new moisturizer This is something I can use every day. I like to use it before and after bed. The feel of it is great. It dries quickly, so I'm able to put my make-up on fairly quickly after I put it on. It makes my face feel smooth. The best part is that it doesn't feel heavy, and that it isn't hard to spread. I think this is my new must-have moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Goes on smoothly and not sticky at all It is lighter than the night cream or the serum I use. Also the smell is not as strong. I use it with the serum and it goes on smoothly over it. It does't leave a sticky feeling on your skin. After you put it on, you can see the shine on your face which makes the appearance of your lines or imperfection less noticeable. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Natural looking self tanner This self tanner is awesome....Gives you a nice brown shade to your skin. It smells good too. Just make sure to wash your hands right after applying. I totally recommend this product!
"Great Stuff After just two weeks of using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I can see noticeable changes. My skin is looking much healthier, younger, smoother and it feels great. Prior to using this product I was using a more expensive brand and I can tell you this one is working better. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Very Light I found this moisturizer to be very light and quickly absorbed into my skin without making my already oily skin more oily. I appreciate the SPF protection. My skin is getting more on the sensitive side and it did not irritate it at all. I think this is a good product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Very smooth! I have been using this product for past 2 weeks twice a day. From day 2 I could see the difference, my face looks much smoother than earlier. Moisturizer consistency is little thick and very little amoutn is needed to spread across the face. I can see the impact of moisturizer till 12 hours. I would really recommend this product."
"excellent Good performance, good quality good price"
"Amazing Nightime Moisturizer! I am in my mid-thirties and in the last year I really feel like I started showing signs of aging skin. My skin was thirsty! I decided to try the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment along with the Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer and Triple Power Daytime Moisturizer because my skin was losing its lustre and I haven't been able to find anything that could bring back that fresh skin glow until I tried this product. After only 5 days my skin was starting to feel smoother, hydrated and my overall complexion was starting to even out. I will continue to use this product because I am excited to see what it can do to my skin after 2-3 weeks of use. Also, I love that it has hyaluronic acid in it as I have read that it is a good time in my skins life to add this ingredient to my skincare regimine as our skin starts to lose its elasticity. I definitely recommend this product to those who need a boost in their skin hydration! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"EXCELLENT!!!!!!!! I have been using all the top rated age related creams and anti wrinkles, NOTHING compares to this product!!! I only used a sample out of the magazine but I will be purchasing a full size tonight as I love it."
"so far so good ! I tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment, L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion Spf 20. and I love all three of these products so far so good They come in nice deep red colored adorable container which i adored. To be honest I was a bit worried about trying these products at first due to I have sensitive skin but after using all three product for about two weeks I have to say i truly love these products they smell fresh and clean and go on smooth it didn't leave my skin dry or irritated which is great for someone like me with sensitive skin. I only had to use a small amount of product which went a long way which is awesome! after using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple power products it left my skin feeling smoother and clean, tighter and made my skin feel great . I will continue using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power and hope to see better results then i already have. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I'm truly loving this! First let me start by saying that I'm pretty picky when it comes to moisturizers. For one thing, I have pretty sensitive skin, which limits what kinds of moisturizers I can use anyway. For another, I hate when a moisturizer is so thick that you have to use large amounts of it to cover your whole face. This L'Oreal Deep-Acting Moisturizer is not like that at all. Even with my sensitive skin I was able to use this moisturizer with no issues whatsoever. And trust me when I say that a little bit goes a long way! When I first used it I used too much, and as a result my skin was left kind of oily. However, during subsequent uses I made sure to use much less, and it was perfect. No oily skin but perfectly soft skin instead. It truly feels amazing going on, and the scent, while still subtle, is very nice and pleasant. My regular moisturizer has no scent to it, and I'm surprised to say that I actually prefer this moisturizer to my regular one, which I've been using for 15 years. Best of all, this moisturizer is actually cheaper! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great product. I have been using Olay Regenerist for 2 months with no improvement in my skin. After using L'Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer for 2 weeks, there was a noticeable difference in the appearance and feel of my facial skin. I use it morning and night and use a sun screen in the day time daily. Great product."
"Saw improvement real fast I received at five day sample of RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer (which I stretched into 10 days)! I've been searching for a good drugstore product for my skin that would help with moisturizing and some deep lines that are starting to form between my eyebrows. I'm 40, but have been put into early menopause because of breast cancer treatments. This product was amazing! After only 10 days, the lines between my eyebrows were significantly diminished!"
Great buy! I always use this taner. It works great and gives a really nice natural tan with no streaks.
Outstanding I use this product on my chest and my legs. This has helped tone my upper legs. I wish they would make body lotion. Recommend this product!
"Love this! What can I say This stuff is amazing. If you are wanting to hydrate your skin, especially during the winter season, this is the stuff right here, It has the creamiest texture and feels like soft butter. I may or may not have warmed it up in a bowl of warm water before applying ( I totally did). It has a fresh clean scent so when I am applying it to my face, there is no overpowering perfume or chemical smell. I have been using it for 5 days now and my face has never been so soft and dewy from actually absorbing the moisturizer. I use it both morning and night and am probably adding it to my skin care regimen permanently. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Silky smooth I have always had a hard time finding a good moisturizer that doesn't leave my face feeling like I just played in an oil vat. The L'Oral Paris revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer is so far one off the best. It smells heavenly and feels heavenly. It leaves my skin so smooth and soft without the oily feel! I've only been using this product for a few days and I can see using it for even longer. I ran out of my lotion for my feet so I decided to use a little bit on my feet even though it's not meant for that, and it even helped my cracked, dry feet! I absolutely love this product!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"High quality moisturizer! I tried the Loreal Revitalift Triple Power deep acting moisturizer and I was very pleased. It comes in a large 1.7 ounce glass jar with a screw on/off lid. It has a very pleasant scent and a creamy texture. It has a slight yellowish color to it, but it doesn't make your skin yellow at all. It is creamy but thick at the same time and easily rubs into my skin. It almost instantly makes my face smoother after it is applied. It reminds me of more expensive and luxurious creams, but without the hefty price tag. This jar will last me a long time and I will definitely recommend this to other women. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great, lightweight moisturizer The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is a great, lightweight moisturizer for aging skin. I have oily skin and was concerned the moisturizer would cause breakouts or excessively shiny skin. After two weeks, I have not had any blemishes. It does make my skin really shiny, so I only use it in the evening. It is a very lightweight moisturizer that doesn't feel heavy or greasy. I saw immediate results in the texture and color of my skin, it looked smoother and more even. I would highly recommend this moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Heavy Duty Moisturizer I am in my early 30's with combo skin and very few issues other than the early wrinkles an occasional dry spots. I have been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks and I really love it, it seems like a heavy duty moisturizer so I only use it at night, it can feel a bit heavy if you apply too much but I can see this working for someone with dry skin. The packaging is very luxurious and the scent is strong but it disappears within a few seconds after applying. Overall I'd recommend this product, I think it works better than other more expensive brands. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Soft silky skin Was not expecting the loreal revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer to be so wonderful! I was so impressed with the the results of the first time use. Soft silky skin, absorbs quickly, not greasy. Love the uplifted look and feel in the tone and texture of my skin. Highly recommend that you try for yourself , after all YOUR WORTH IT!!! Love the new product line that targets the loss of collagen in the facial skin. The moisturizer is great non greas9,feels like a luxurious spa quality cream. I'mWorthington!

Love the feeling I've used a lot of different moisturizers in the past. With prior experiences I've had numerous problems with skin irritation after uses. To my surprise I didn't have that issue with this one. It's a thicker cream that rubbed in nicely. The smell wasn't one that annoyed me like some do. I liked the fact that I immediately felt a difference and could still feel it working as the day went on. I didn't have an issue with it making make face more oily. I also didn't have an issue with my face becoming irritated after a few hours. To me that was a big plus! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Final Report OMG...I've fallen in love with my L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment, and Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20! Just look at the decrease in my bags under my eyes and my wrinkles are disappearing. It's only been a few weeks and I'm seeing some dramatic positive results. I can't begin to recommend these products enough to anyone who wants to bring back a youthful complexion! Thanks L'Oreal for the confidence boost! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Thick and Rich This jar of facial moisturizer may appear small in size, but is so powerful I only need a small amount on my fingertip to make a noticeable difference. I apply this in the morning and night to my entire face and neck. After just two weeks of use, I see my neck showing fewer signs of aging. Less lines, less saggy looking. I have fewer lines around my mouth and eyes, too. Plus, the moisturizer absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves me with a beautiful smooth, radiant glow that gives me confidence. Thanks L'Oreal! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Reliable I've used this product on my legs, in the summer, for years. A quick even tan, no heavy fragrance. My experience is, if applied after a shower (on dry, un-lotioned skin), and then forego scrubbing skin when showering in daily showers after that (I let the soapy water sluice over to dry and pat dry) your nice tan will fade away evenly and you'll be ready for an re-application in 5-7 days. On the day of re-applicatoin, I will go ahead and scrub my legs with a bath sponge to prepare for an even application. Can you over-apply and end up with splotchiness Yes. But what I described above generally guarantees a natural looking, non-splotchy, evenly fading tan you can rely on, all summer."
"Deep Acting Facial Mositurizer I stated using the products 3 days ago. The Deep Acting Moisturizer is a great product for everyday use. Does not feel heavy or oily on my face. I am also using this product on my neck and check where I am showing visual aging and crepy skin. After the product soaks in, I feel the tightening effect. The smell of the product is pleasant and not overpowering. Cant wait to review this product again in a couple of weeks as I already see and feel the positive effects of the product with the 3 days I have been using it.

"Spa quality moisturizing! I am in love with the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer!! I used to dread my skin care routine because my face always felt either greasy or irritated, BUT this moisturizer changed that for me. First, the texture is amazing. Its a thick cream that feels very luxurious and silky. It feels luxurious and silky on the face as well, and depite the thickness of the cream, it feels lightweight. It is not greasy at all. My skin looks evenly toned, full, and smooth even immediately after applying. My previously flaky,dry zones are now soft and smooth. I have also noticed my wrinkles lessening in just a week. Another thing I love about it is the scent. It smells just as luxurious as it feels! It smells like the spa! I love to apply at bedtime so that I'm smelling the spa as I relax off to dreamland. I will definitely be buying more. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Amazing product that made a huge difference in my skin I recently turned 36 and am looking for ways to keep my skin looking younger as long as possible. I definitely don't have any huge wrinkles yet, but am starting to see fine lines around my eyes and want to ensure that I don't add to that collection! This serum worked wonders for my skin and kept it hydrated without feeling greasy. Any areas where I was starting to see dryness was immediately corrected with the serum and I feel that it's going to be an instrumental product at keeping my skin hydrated and youthful. Now that we're getting into the cooler months I feel that this will be my go to product throughout the fall and winter to keep my skin healthy. I have very oily skin that is blemish prone and didn't notice any increase in oil production or acne with the use of this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Got to Love it!! This triple power deep acting facial moisturizer is a very fast working product. I could feel it starting to work with the very first application. My skin feels smooth yet tight at the same time. I noticed the fine lines around my eyes starting to diminish after the first use and more and more every day. My crows feet are almost gone. My laugh lines are a little more stubborn. They are starting to be less bold now after a few uses of this serum and I am positive they will completely disappear with regular use of L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer and my skin is now so very soft. It reminds me of what my skin was like when I was in my late teens and early 20's. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Love this product!!! It really works on wrinkles. I reccommend that customers by this product from Pharmapack.
"Best cream ever I think this is the best cream I have used. I use it over the serum and its not greasy or sticky. I use the lotion in the day with the serum, but sometimes I use the cream.Its so good that it does not make my foundation gross.Sometimes creams are to tacky and thick.I will tell you this is perfect. There is not one bad thing to say about this product. I will be running out soon, but a little goes a long way. I noticed my husband using it. And he say he really likes it.So I will be getting us more soon so we don't run out.Way to go Loreal...I use many of their products and I am never disappointed, I have already told my friends and family about it and they are going to buy it.Love it!!!!!!!!

"Best Moisturizer on the Market! I have struggled for many years to find a moisturizing product for my combination skin and have been unsuccessful. That is until i received a sample of the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Deep Acting Moisturizer and Serum! These products are simply amazing. After just one application of both products, I noticed a major difference from the products i normally use. Although the moisturizer has a thick and creamy texture, it is very light after applying to the face. And also the fact that a little dab goes a long way, is a MAJOR plus for me! The combination of both products left my skin smooth, firm and moisturized all day. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. Great job L'Oreal! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Totally surprised I must honestly say i was a a doubting thomas. Most products of this sort make all these claims and fall short of their promises. This product however does what is says it will do . I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for the past three days am and pm like it tells you to do. I must say i'm surprised , I have noticed my skin tone evening out , my skin is smoother. I would recommend this product to anyone, proudly i might add. It's always nice to come across a product that does what it says it will do. I have included an before and after photo to show the difference . I hope you all can see it . I'm afraid my photo skills need work This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great Product Wife has used this for years and swears by it. Walmart has best price by far!
Wonderful moisturizer Love this moisturizer for mature skin!
"I'm shocked at how much I love this product! I have very oily and acne prone skin. Moisturizers scare me! The first thing I noticed is how pretty the tub of moisturizer is, my favorite color is purple, the second is how nice it smells. I was really surprised at how quickly my skin seemed to drink the moisturizer in which is very uncommon for my skin. I applied the moisturizer after the serum from the same line from L'Oreal and go to bed with lovely scented soft skin. To top it all off, not only did my skin not break out it cleared up! I will continue to use this every night. I have always loved L'Oreal and had just run out of my Youth Code night cream and now I'll be using the RevitaLift.

"Facial moisturizer I really enjoyed the moisturizer application to my face. My skin really, really felt more refreshed. When your skin feels good I think your face kinds of glows. I know I do. I really feel little sample packets that folks could try at the cosmetic counter would feel what I felt on their face. Your face just feels good. I hope you do this. This would really help. I know when I go to the counter I'm really overwhelmed by the abundance of products. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great moisturizer I have been using this product for about a year. I haven't experienced an outbreaks, it absorbs quickly and I have seen a visible improvement in the look of my skin. It appears brighter and more youthful. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Best Self Tanner Available Where can i start This is my second self-tanner, the other was Kroger Brand. It smelled great, but did absolutely nothing. THIS brand is by far the best! You never get streaks, unless you use too little of the product and try to spread too little around your legs. By the way, this can be used anywhere on your body, even your face, and it didn't break me out. I'm very pale naturally, and this is the only one that makes me look NATURALLY tan. The only small flaw is that since you use a good amount of the product, so you don't streak, you go through it rather quickly. But that's just me. So, buy in bulk, as it doesn't get sold in every walmart near me, at least. Overall, the best for your buck for ANY need to look NATURALLY TAN."
"Excellent product This is my first time trying the moisturizer by L'Oreal and I love it. I love that it does just moisturizes my face and not leave it greasy and oily after I put it on or even later in the day. Before using this I was using the old fashion moisturizer...Vaseline, it would moisturize but it would leave my face very greasy. I think I found the moisturizer that I been looking for. it makes my skin very soft and smooth, I have noticed the difference since using it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Fantastic Products!! I'm loving this facial moisturizer! I was in the market for a new facial regimen and using this moisturizer along with the serum is doing wonders for my skin! My skin in visibly smother and more hydrated. Living in dry weather, I need a product that can nourish my skin in the driest of conditions. I will be using these products from now on! So happy to have gotten the opportunity to try them. Try these products, you will not be disappointed!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Wonderful Product! I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer every night for two weeks. I love the way my 58 year old skin looks. No more dry patches and my makeup goes on smooth. My skin actually looks firmer and more dewey. The moisturizer is just the right consistency. It absorbs fully, but is not greasy. I have tried a lot of products over the years, and this one is by far the best! No exaggeration here! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"i just turned 55 and this was a godsend. my face feels smooth, looks brighter and smells great. i will be using these products from now on. THANK YOU! I've tried many many products in my lifetime, but as I age my skin changed and products i used to use no longer work. I never used Loreal products before, but since using these i'm never going to use another different product again. easy to use face looks and feels really wonderful and i look and feel younger This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"LOVE this product! I've been using this moisturizer for about a week now, and I have to say I LOVE IT! It makes my skin silky smooth and it absorbs quickly without being greasy. My skin looks and feels hydrated, while usually this time of year my skin is dry! I haven't noticed much in the way of fine lines disappearing, but it's only been a week! I will continue to use this product and would recommend it to anyone! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The amazing results of L'Oreal Paris Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer My skin is so soft now!!! I have lost a lot of the redness in my cheeks. I would recommend this product to every one. I used the L'Oreal Paris Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer in the morning and in the evening. Even applying over L'Oreal Concentrated Facial Serum the product was still light weight, and non greasy. Works perfectly under my make-up too. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great moisturizer! I am really enjoying using the L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer! It is a thick cream that works easily into my skin. I feel softer after. It does not leave my face feeling heavy or greasy though which is a plus. I have only been using it for two weeks but I can see a decrease in the depth of my forehead wrinkles.

Works well for me I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer in I could honestly say it has been doing a great deal for my face and neck area. I suffer from dryness in this moisturizer came in handy. Plus I've been enjoying the complements of looking younger then what I am. BzzzAgent you guys rock!!!!

EXCELLENT PRODUCT I was super excited to get these L'Oreal products and they did not disappoint one bit. I feel like i prefer I serum that is see through. But that's just my preference. This does really prepare my skin for my makeup products. It makes my skin look and feel very soft and super smooth. It smells of soft flowers but it's not offensive. As far as repairing...I haven't used it long enough. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Another Great Product I have been using all three of the products for over a week. I like to use the products together because I think they make my face healthy. The moisturizer is nice and not too thick. The scent is nice too. I feel these three products from L'Oreal are worth the money. The amount that we get for the cost is reasonable. I like the deep acting moisture in this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great Product I think this product is great. It goes on easy and the color lasts a long time. It does get dirty looking around your knees and ankles, however if you apply regular body lotion after the tanning lotion and rub those area's it smooths it right out and matches the color. I also apply less tanning lotion to those areas and it seems to not give you the dirty look. This is great product for someone who cannot go out in the sun and get a normal tan. It does not make your skin look orange either..... I highly recommend."
"Light and airy. I received this product for free in return for an honest review. Bottom line, I really like this product. Let me tell you why. First, the jar it comes in is glass, not plastic, very, very nice. Easy to open and replace the cap. Light, airy, not greasy and blends in very easily. Even on hot days (I used this for 2 weeks in late June/early July), my face never felt weighed down or greasy or oily. Very little scent, but what scent there is, it is nice and light. A little goes a long way so I believe this jar will last a long time. I am 90 sure I will buy L'oreal Revitalift when I need a new jar."
Loved this product I got this product for free to try out and I was skeptical about how much it could do in 14 days. While I don't have a lot of deep wrinkles it did minimize them and made my skin feel so hydrated! But the biggest surprise was how smooth my neck and chest looked and felt! I loved this product and will definitely keep using it and recommend it!
"Super Wow!!! I started with a sample from a magazine which lasted for 4 days. I knew then how little product would be needed to be effective and immediately could see the difference in the hydration of my skin. I have purchased other moisturizers that would not really absorb into my skin and left it greasy and increased my adult acne problem. I am almost 46 and have never been told I was over 35, but my hands started giving me away. The skin was thinning and starting to look really aged. This product was working so well on my face, and it took such a small amount, two nights ago I gave it a shot on my hands. I must say that was one of the best decisions I have ever made. After just 2 treatments, my hands were no longer dry and withered looking, the skin felt and appeared to be plumper and my hands have not felt this soft since I was a young child. I also wash my hands a lot throughout the day and the effect stayed with me the entire day. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to maintain or improve their youthful appearance."
I love this moisturizer It isn't heavy feeling or sticky yet it is doing what it says it does. I haven't used it very long but I can already see an improvement in my skin.
"Awesome Deep Acting Moisturizer!! I have been using L'Oral Paris Revitalift Deep Acting Moisturizer for 15 days and I honestly can't say enough great things about it! I have very sensitive skin and I have a hard time find moisturizer that doesn't irritate my skin, but I haven't had one issue with this product. It has a light airy fragrance that absorbs quickly and doesn't linger. The moisturizer is thick and creamy but is very light weight when applied. A little bit of this goes a long way! I literally dip my finger tip in the moisturizer and it covers my entire face. I've used this product two times a day for 15 days and you can barely tell I have used any of it. After I apply this in the morning, and let it dry, I apply my makeup on over top and it makes my face look flawless! It tightens my skin and smooths out the lines around my eyes and mouth. My husband has notice a huge improvement in my skin complexion and smoothness since using this product. I high recommend this product to anyone, no matter your skin top. I promise you won't regret it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
It works! Noticeable difference within the first week of use! I only use it at night though to avoid oily skin during the day. I would recommend this to everyone!
REALLY GOOD I have been using this for about three weeks in the morning and evening and it has greatly helped my dry skin. It is very concentrated and you only need a small amount for the entire face so it is also cost efficient. I think it is a great product and will definitely be purchasing it again.
"The PERFECT Moisturizer I had been using Cerave moisturizer and THOUGHT I was happy with the results of that product until I tried this product! WOW! What a difference! This product goes on so smoothly and is so light, yet makes my skin incredibly soft and smooth. It is not greasy or oily upon application, and does not cause me to shine a few hours later. In fact, my skin has never looked better! I received this as a sample in the Walmart Beauty Box. I have thrown away my Cerave and now only use this moisturizer"
"The Triple Power is even better for Revitalift I loved the quality and effectiveness of Revitalift. This version of Triple Power works even better! It is super-creamy and smells great,too! I already received compliments on how I look!"
L'oreal Paris Revtialift Triple Power Deep Acting facial moisturiser I think the revitalift triple power deep facial moisturiser is awesome! Since using this product I've noticed that my skin is alot smoother and softer it also gives your face a pretty soft look love how it feels! I also tried the l'oreal Paris triple power concentrated facial serum treatment along with L'oreal Paris Revtialift Triple Power facial day lotion these three all togather will give you very soft pretty skin minus the Sun spots and wrinkles! I've noticed that the wrinkles that were on my forhead are definitely disappearing so it makes my skin look and feel alot younger soft and pretty! Ontop of that I had alot of Sun spots espically around my mouth and the darkness is gradually fading! I wish I knew about these products along time ago! Just a reminder when using it you only need a tiny bit of each product! Also make sure you keep using it I started seeing results after about a week I couldn't believe how well it works! Over all I'm very satisfied my face looks so much fuller healthier and soft before using these I couldn't say anything nice about my face and skin! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Perfect I am so pleased with this product, especially the value! You get quick results, it's a nice dark (but natural) color and it doesn't streak! Best self-tanner I've ever used."

Revitalift Works Great. Had great results with the moisturer. Love the product. Would recommend women to buy it.
"Received Today Day 1(PM): Triple concentrated serum had a smooth feeling on my face, absorbed thoroughly and left a non-greasy feel, has a pleasant scent. Followed by deep-acting moisturizer which had a thicker consistency than the serum but also very smooth and absorbed well into my skin. My skin feels Uber moisturized and non greasy, so far I really like the product!! I will update after 1 week of daily use and at 2 weeks. What I would like to know before buying: the size of the products is awesome, not the tiny jars most companies sell for lots of . The scent is not over powering and it's totally NOT greasy:) This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I Love This! So I may not be the target age for this product (I'm 24) but I love it! My skin feels so soft and moisturized. It also didn't break out my acne prone skin.
"New Favorite I'll be real honest, I was super skeptical when using this product and seeing changes as in little as three days. I am so excited to see what the results will be in in 30 days. My skin has never been smoother softer Or younger looking. I am s believer now!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"The best self-tanner. And I have tried them all! I have been using this self-tanner for years. For a while, I had a difficult time finding it and in that time I have tried every brand available...from high end to low. Without question, Banana Boat is the best. It does not streak at all. I get a compliment everyday (no lie) on my beautiful tan. (I am fair skinned with blonde hair). No one ever can believe that it is from a product."
"This Works My face is softer, less lines, and fresher looking. I love the way my face is feeling. It does not cause skin problems for me."
"Really Rehydrated My Skin I tried RevitaLift Triple Power Moisturizer for 5 days, and it really helped to make my skin look and feel more youthful. I am definitely planning to buy. Thank you for the sample."
Lovely I requested a 5 day sample of Triple Power and was so impressed that I went right out and purchased a jar. It absorbs into my skin so nicely and does seem to lift. I saved one of the day smaples for my mom to try. I think she will really like to too.
Love This Moisturizer! This moisturizer was a pleasure to use! It was a light cream-my face loved it! My skin looked and felt smoother and firmer!
I Feel Younger Already! Left my skin soft and smooth and I feel younger with just a few uses. Love this product!
"Actually Works! I was fortunate to be able to try a sample of the product and with how frugal I am, I have to say that I will actually be looking for and buying this product. I am in my mid-40's and I live in Texas. The weather is insane and I am very fair skinned with sensitive combination skin...so I always need a moisturizer and one that won't make me break out or look like an oil spill. I was pleasantly surprised that it absorbed well, no horrid scent, and my face looked refreshed-not greasy. Happy me!"
"My Face Feels Wonderful!! After using this product the first day I felt a very positive change! My face has been smoother and soft to touch. More imporvements were made with every day of use. I have had no braeak outs, redness, or dryness!! I would highly recommend this product!"
I Feel The Difference I have been looking for a great mositurizer that wasn't heavy or oily and would leave my skin feeling soft and looking radiant. I'm very impressed by the quality of this product and the results have been amazing! My skin is feeling/looking noticeable smoother and supple.
"Truly Deep-acting! I tried this product for the first time, and have been using it daily. I believe I have seen a visible difference in my skin - the thin areas seem plumper, and my face actually looks better hydrated. I intend to purchase it, switching from my present moisturizer."
Love It! This is a great product. The texture is so smooth and makes your skin feel great.
So much easier than the one-time sunless tanners Banana Boat sunless gradual tanning lotion goes on easily and looks great. This is a great alternative to tanning beds.
"Great Results My skin looked and felt fantastic, results were better than I thought they would be."
Great Lifting Cream The new Tripel Power Lift is great for the neck and throat. Was using the Double lift before and really like the results of the Triple Lift. I can feel it working as soon as I put it on.
"Smooth my skin looked smooth and i looked like i took off a couple of years,i want some for every day"
Love This Very good and quality product. I will use them again.
Enlightened Expressions I have used your products for 4 years. I am delighted with my personal results. Thank you.
Wonderful I really like the way RevitaLift made my skin look and feel. I seen results in the first two days and I like the results a lot. I have told my friends all about it. Thanks
Very Smooth Nice scent! Makes skin feel smooth. I have very sensitive skin and it was not irritating. A little goes a long way. Moisturizer is very light...never know it's been applied.
Incredible Moisturizer! I am very impressed with this product. My facial skin has never seen felt better. RevitaLift feels like a silky coating when applied. I would definitely recommend it!
Smooth And Hydrating Loved the feel of the product on my skin. it was satiny smooth and didn't tighten my skin nor imbalance the oils in my T zone.
Love This Lotion This lotion was lightweight and non-greasy. It felt wonderful.
"BB Sunless Tanning Lotion, YES, YES, YES !!! I have tried dozens of self tanner's, BB self tanner is simply the best, tan's evenly looks natural and is priced very well."

"Deffinetly Love It !!! with in days results where shown ,gave my skin that fresh glow"
"My Skin Looks Much Healthier I have used MANY products that claim to make wrinkles look dimished, to make skin look brighter but NEVER do any of that. This product DOES! I call it my Fountain of youth in a bottle."
Makes Face Feel Tight I love the way revitalift triple power makes your face feel. Tighter and soft.
"Love This tried it, loved it, bought it !"
"Revitallift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer I live in the West it is extremely Dry, along with the climate the dryness from the furnace to heat our home, I have very dry skin. I had to let others in my age group know that Loreal RevitalLift Moisturizer is AMAZING! I have noticed that my skin is so much more nourished. The flakiness is sloughed off and my skin is smooth and nourished. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!"
"My Skin Looks And Feels Amazing! To be honest, I thought this was just going to be a sample I put in the emergency outta moisterizer drawer, however, I used it right away on a whim and I LOVED it! It seemed to effortlessy glide right into my skin and, after using it twice a day, I was amazed at how much better my skin looked and felt. My makeup stayed fresher and the few wrinkles I have tightened up. No dry patchs in December!! Only con....it has a very strong fragrance."
"Excellent I am very pale and had skin cancer, this product provides a nice tan look that starts instantly and darkens with each application, allowing me to have a tan look through summer so I can wear capris and shorts"
Nothing Makes My Skin Feel Better I love this product as it makes my skin feel wonderful!
Love This Moisturizer this is a great product that truly moistens my skin!!
Softer Skin Like Never Before This Moisturizer is so awesome. My skin felt so soft and moisturized like never before and felt soft for a longer period. With regular application even the fine lines disappear.
"Great Skincare Even though I only tried a sample of it, I noticed a difference. I used it at night right before I went to sleep. When I woke up in the morning, my face still felt really soft and smooth and I didn't have any new breakouts."
"65th Birthday Gift! I will be 65 in a few days..and I received the best gift from Revitalift! I have bought very expensive creams with just minor results. I received the 5 day test and what a change! It's hard to correct 65 years of damage, but This did just great. I'm out today to buy my supply."
"Face Felt So Smooth And Looked Sooooooooooooo Good Loved it,will be buying this product my face so smooth and lines fading my four daughters are also buying this product."
"Gave Me A Dewy Complexion Now that I'm in my mid 40s I'm always looking for products that make my skin look younger. RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer glided on my skin. After using it every night for a week, I'm waking up to a lovely dewy soft complexion. I love it."
I Loved Revitalift!! I was really impressed with the results I got from RevitaLift. I started using it the first day and was amazed at the really thick and creamy texture. It melted right into my skin. My face felt great right away and throughout the rest of the day. I was looking forward to putting it on the second day and was not disappointed. My skin looks much more even toned and tight after the 14 days. I'm hooked for life!!
"Great Product!! I loved the immediate feeling of moisturized, soft skin. I haven't used it for very long..just a week or so, but I plan on purchasing this and see if I can get some of the fine wrinkles/lines back to the past!"
"Let It Do The Rest I have tried this for a week now and all I can saw is wow! I have extremely dry skin that is very sensitive as well. Not only do I wake up with soft, moisturized skin that feels supple, I love the fact that I have had absolutely no sensitivy problems. Such a relief to know that I can put this on, and let it do it's thing while I sleep! Life having little elves on my face! And a little goes a long way. PS: my husband has used it 3 times during this time at night, seasonal dry skin."
"Realistic Tan I love this Product! Please do not change a thing, as far as, performance. It could use a little scent upgrade, maybe more of a summery tropical or coconut smell, but either way I will continue to use this product. It has a great selling price point considering the quality of tan you get from using this product. I get many complements on my tan and when I tell people I use a self-tanning lotion and its a Banana Boat product rather than a high dollar, can only order from the internet product, they are floored. Thank you for this wonderful product and my skin thanks you too. I believe most people, including myself, feel good when they have that summery, non-orange, glow, but feel guilty when getting it from the sun or a tanning booth. I can now enjoy that glow without the orange, without the guilt, and without hurting my skin. :-)"
"Love The Lift! I found the RevitaLift Triple Power Moisturizer absolutely fantastic! I am 58 and am often told I look 46! I could see a noticeable difference after just 2 usages. I will be a loyal user. Love, love, LOVE this product!"
Nourishes Thirsty Skin I have always used Loreal eye and face creams. The triple power moisturizer seemed more potent and I know my skin was softer. It is a good value and coupons make it an affordable daily necessity.
Smooth I love this product because it leaves your skin very smooth and moisturised. You can really feel the hydration is going deep in you skin. It really works. Thank you.
Awesome Smooth Skin I use the product morning
Deep Acting Moisturizzer very light and seems to be effective
"Great Fragance And Moisturizer! Product is smooth and creamy. Goes on easily and soaks in properly. Provides moisturizer relief deep into the skin. Has a wonderful fragrance, not overpowering. Highly recommend."
Al You Need In One Jar This product is amazing! You will see results in 2 days. It goes on smoothly and is not greasy. My husband complemented me on how my face looks more youthful and bright. The fine lines around my eyes are less visibile. It does what it says it will.
"Revitalift Magic This stuff totally blew me away. I wasn't expecting it to work as well as it did in just a few short days. I am a new true fan, Thanks Loreal"
Revitalift I have been using Revitalift products for about 10 months now and I really like it. This RevitaLift Triple Power is very nice. Feels good and adds more moisture than the non triple power. Would definitely recommend to anyone
"This Is As Soft As It Gets I really liked how soft my face felt, not for just a while but for the entire day."
"best natural looking color... I love it!! I've tried so many others and they are no match. This goes on natural looking. Just use a dry cloth to wipe knees, toes, around ankles and the back of legs behind knees after you rub it in. I have got alot of compliments with this... most people can't beleive its not real. It blends in with my natural skin tone. I get so aggravated when I go to a store and they have every brand but this one. And btw: the lotion is much better than the spray. Don't stop selling. The best!! thus far!!"
"Started Working Right Away I live in a very dry climate, and my skin feels dry much of the time. Just after using RevitaLife Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer for the first couple of days, I could feel a huge difference in my facial skin. It felt revitalized and refreshed. Great product!"
"Ultimate Moisturizung This moisturizer was light yet very moisturizing, and I didn't have to use as much!"
From 71 Yrs To 60 Or Lower Skin is revitalized and healthy looking
"Skin Feels Sooooo Good! THis prodauct is wonderful for the price! I don't believe you could ever find a product that works as well as this for this price! I love the way it made my skin feel, so soft and smooth. If you try this peoduct I believe you will love it as much as I do!"
"Smooth Skin I started with a sample, I knew then how this product is amazing!!! Immediately could see the difference in the hydration of my skin. My skin feels so smooth avery day. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to maintain or improve their youthful appearance. Best product e ever had!!!!"
Revitalift Triple My face started looking and feeling much smoother after first couple of days. I will definitely keep using it
"I Was Really Surprised I'm 56 and have worked in the cosmetic business and have used some of the most expensive products out there. I was really surprised to actually SEE a difference within 2 days. Like the other review here, I sleep on my side"
"My Face Feels Fantastic! This product is great ! It smells wonderful and makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated. It does not feel heavy or greasy . Also, my makeup goes on smoothly. Thank you Loreal."
"Great Product; Love It I have mature skin and the Loreal Revita lift Triple Power moisturizer is a nice moisturizer, its not too heavy, smells great and feels good on my skin. I use it in morning under my makeup. There is no sunscreen in this product just remember to add some type of SPF to the skin to prevent sun damage. I also use a little at night just after using the Revita lift serum. After using over a period of time I could see a slight change in the texture of my skin."
"Loved! I am a moisturizing fanatic and have used many different mositurizers in the past. Loreal sent me five days worth of their RevitaLift Triple Power samples. First off, it was thick which I loved. It went on smoothly and gave off a slight cooling sensation. Throughout the morning I could smell the fresh clean scent of the moisturizer. It was not overpowering but just strong enough that I would get a pleasant whiff of it every now and then. Even after a few days, I felt my skin was tighter."
"Best self tanner! This is by far the best self tanner I've ever used...and I've used A LOT. Smells great, easy to apply, and natural looking color. Only thing is I can't find in any stores this year, I really hope it's not discontinued. I was so excited to see it on Walmart.com that I ordered 4 bottles! Banana Boat please continue making this product, it's amazing!!"
Skin Looks Younger Moisturizes and makes my skin look and feel younger
"Mamaw User I could instantly feel the skin firming up. You have sold me, keep doing what you are doing"
"Satisfying Results Within A Few Days I rarely take the time to write a review, but I feel so satisfied with this product I just had to write to say Thank you! I was so pleased to have received enough samples of this product to give me a chance to really see if I like it or not. After several days I knew it was the moisturizer I've been looking for. I have purchased my first jar. At 61 yrs old and I can look in the mirror and smile."
Amazing amazing revitalift triple power...it works and makes me younger..
Very Soft Skin I so enjoyed using Revitalift Triple Power Moisturizer. It was so silky smooth to the touch. I liked how it made my skin so soft but not oily feeling. My skin stayed soft all day!!! I will be buying this in the future. You don't have to use alot of the moisturizer either so this makes it worth the extra money to get.
"Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Moisturizer This product was easy to apply, felt wonderful, and I believe I could actual see a difference in the look of fine wrinkles after use of this product for one week. This product was gentle to my skin, and felt very expensive."
"Smooth Feeling Skin I just love the way this product makes my skin feel.It has a great scent too not over powering.I love the creamy feel of the lotion.I use it every night before I go to bed,and when I get up.It's a great product!"
"The Best Moisturizer I have been having problems with dry patches on my face. I have been trying everything. The RevitaLift Triple Power not only took care of these dry patches but gives my face a smooth, firmer looking skin. I loved this moisturizer so well I went out and purchased the eye and serum as well. I am hoping the results will be amazing."
Triple Power Deep-acting Moisturizer Free Samples I absolutely loved this product and plan to keep using it. I love the way that it glides on and is absorbed without the heavy feel or alcohol burn of some moisturizers. The texture of my face feels like velvet and my skin feels nourished instead of dry and tight. Thank you for 5 days of this product so that I could get a comprehensive understanding of the difference between the good stuff and what I had been using.
Love The Moisture! 1. Love the moisturizer that kept my make-up from creasing in my wrinkles.
"Not greasy I finally found a moisturizing product that will absorb completely and not leave my skin feeling like it's suffocating. I apply it, and it feels like there is nothing there but my skin looks smoother. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great product worked as stated Just the right color, not too dark for my light skin! The key is to use a little at a time and follow directions. The sad thing is I ordered several different items from the same department. What a shame you didn't mail more products at one time! Several products came one at a time! WHAT a waste of money!"
"Loreal Revitalift Triple Power I just want to say that this is a great moisturizer i just loved it ,I defenitely will be recommending to friends and family I saw great improved in the texture of my skin and firmness"
Revitalift® Triple Power the best product ive ever used....definitely recommend this product...good moisturizing effect with deep acting formula..
I Love This Stuff I'm 43 and slowly losing elasticity in my skin and my face looks tired. I used the moisturizer for 7 days to see if this one was any different than any of the others I've tried. I saw results within 3 days. The moisturizer itself is great and the firmness of my skin had shown visable signs of improvement. I will continue to use this product and recommend it to anyone my age who is tired of all the next best products.
Love It! Kept my face so soft.
"Excellent Moisturizer! The results of Revitalift Triple Power were noticable very quickly after I began using it. Using in the morning and evening my skin was much softer and refined.Revitalift also has a very plesant scent that is not over powering, I will continue using for my moisturizing needs."
Great Product! This felt so good on my face. I love the way it made my skin feel so soft. It was smooth and easy to apply. I loved it! I went right out and bought myself a bottle
I Love It! I have always loved Loreal products and this one is no different. This is probably the best moisurizer that I have ever used. I will definitely be buying this again.
Nothing Works Better This is the greatest.. smells wonderful..too.
"Love This. Feels light going on, but leaves my skin feeling softer and smoother immediately."
"A Redhead's Fair Skin Looks Like A Million Bucks! Being a Redhead with fair skin, it has a tendency to dry out. I've tried other products, even Oil of Olay, it made my skin drier. Not L'Oreal's RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer, it made my dry skin dewy and soft!"
"Only self-tanner worth buying. I have tried multiple self-tanners (being extremely pale yet at extra high risk for skin cancer because of my family background) and this is the absolute ONLY one I've found worth blinking about! Be cautious around knees, elbows, and heels, etc. but besides that it is GREAT!"
Fabulous Moisturizer I had the opportunity to try the RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and just want to say this is a wonderful product. I loved it and I especially loved the results. I'm 43 and starting to worry about wrinkles and fine-lines. There was a noticeable difference... I should say improvement... after using this product. I'm sold.
I Feel And Look Younger I love it! And the complaments are great I look younger and refreshed!
Revitalift Works Great! I recieved a sample of revitalift which i was happy to try. I loved the somewhat thicker texture of the cream. It was not greasy at all and absorbed quickly which i love! Smell was nice but not too overpowering and didn't linger for long. I love to have a light non greasy and clean feeling after using a face cream and this did it! Now time will tell on the softening of wrinkles and tightning of the skin but im willing to try.
"Moisturizing I love it! Very moisturizing, makes my face feel clean"
Great Product It made my skin feel so soft and smooth. I would definitely recommend this product!
Great Moisterizer! I loved this product! It's not too greasy for my face and my skin is so soft now.
"One Of The Best Moisturizers Well,it is winter here in Maine and I deffinately needed a better moisturizer! I got my 5 day sample at just the right tiime!I have to use a really good moisturizer in the winter and this worked EXTREMELY well!!I loved the way it made my face and neck feel soooo good ALL through the day and didn't make it feel like an oil slick!!!It even made my makeup look alot more natural!!"
Great Product Revitalift truly works and helps with wrinkles. It felt great and I noticed a difference on my face.
What A Great Moisturizer Revitalist Moisturizer is a wonderful product. It worked on my skin without feeling heavy or greasy. Did a great job under my liquid foundation.
"Best Ever I used my 5 day free trial cream and loved it. Now I have 2 jars of cream. I don't want to be without it, it works great. I can already see the difference in my skin. Wrinkles have lessened and my skin seems tighter. You should try this at least once to form your own opinion. You won't be disappointed."
Great natural color I love this stuff. I get such a natural looking tan that will last about a week. I highly recomend!!
Not All Moisturizers Are The Same A few weeks ago I received a sample of RevitaLift. I've used it every day since then and there is a noticable improvement in my complextion. My skin is tighter and smoother. Now I know not all moisturizers are the same and I will only buy RevitaLift in the future.
"It's So Creamy! I really like the RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and will be purchasing it. It seems to be making my aging skin a little firmer and I love the scent! And it feels good on my sensitive skin. A little goes a long way, too. Thank you for making such a wonderful product."
Revitallift Triple Power This stuff was amazing! Truly a product that lives up to its expectations.
Wow!!! This stuff is awesome. My skin is smoother and firmer.
"Never Too Early To Start I'm in my early 30's but I would recommend this moisturizer to ANYONE of any age group who wants a top notch product. I use this daily in the morning after a normal cleansing routine. It goes on light and smooth with a pleasant scent. I have somewhat sensitive skin and can break out easily but I've yet to do so with this moisturizer. I also tend to suffer from redness/ruddiness during the dry, colder months and haven't since using this product. My skin has never felt softer."
"Just Love This Moisturizer! I have used other moisturizers in the past. But, I just love this moisturizer within weeks of using this product. My wrinkles had softened and I could notice visible firmness to my face. I will be purchasing this product from this day forward."
Works Amost Like Magic I'm amazed how well it started to soften the wrinkles and in such a short time. I think I've finally found the best moisturizer for me!!!
"Excellent Product I loved this product! Went on very smoothly, my skin felt wonderful after each use and throughout the day. I would highly recommend this to everyone!"
Love It! This is a fabulous product! I started seeing results within the first week. You need to go out and snag this today!
Revitalift Triple Power love this product' my skin has never felt better!!
"The best!! I cannot express how much I love this product. I used to be a heavy tanning bed user, but I stopped for my skins sake and have struggled to find a product that gives me a deep natural looking tan. This self tanner is amazing, it gets me darker than using the tanning bed ever did and with no sun damage or worrying about aging! The color is so deep and natural looking that people actually ask me if I've started using the tanning bed again when I use this. It doesn't streak and isn't orange and isn't greasy or sticky. I absolutely adore this self tanner and I always recommend it to my friends."
Up Lifting this a great product. works great only thing you need.it is all i use. seen a difference in just a few weeks
Great Product I was very impressed with this product by day 3. love it.
Excellent Product! Great Results Fast! I love the smooth texture of ReviatLift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer. In one week my skin looked noticeably better.
Deep Acting Moisturizer it really works great and it does not make your skin feel greasy like others do. I love it
Fantastic Product Fountain of youth for a 63 year old. You can see the difference in less than a week. Fewer wrinkles and more toned skin. Definitely a keeper!
"Saw Improvement Real Fast I received at five day sample of RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer (which I stretched into 10 days)! I've been searching for a good drugstore product for my skin that would help with moisturizing and some deep lines that are starting to form between my eyebrows. I'm 40, but have been put into early menopause because of breast cancer treatments. This product was amazing! After only 10 days, the lines between my eyebrows were significantly diminished!"
Love This Moisturiser I was looking for a penetrating moisturiser and L'Oreal came up with this deep-acting moisturiser..I liked the way it made my skin feel and the light scent. I like the results I acheived also.
"Great Product! I received samples of this in the mail and have been using it for about two weeks and love it! I have always taken really good care of my skin and tried alot of different products. I use this at night with one of the L'Oreal Eye treatments. It's not too heavy, not greasy.....just right!! I would highly recommend trying it!"
"Silky Smooth Skin I really enjoyed using this moisturizer. I live in AZ so I really need a good product for dry skin. This left my skin silky, smooth but was not heavy on my skin."
Love This Product I love how this makes my skin feel and it smells nice too.
"Great Product I did some research before settling on this particular brand and I am so happy that I did. The reviews placed Banana Boat tanner on a top ten list. It doesn't turn orange on my skin and does a great job at moisturizing. I couldn't find the product at my store, so I just ordered on line and had it in 2 days! Love it."
Revitalift Wonder! What is not to like in this product. I saw results as soon as I used it! It really moisturizes my skin without leaving any residue. I will absolutely continue to use it.
"Wonderful Moisturizer So glad I had the chance to try this product. I'm starting to get some fine lines under the corners of my mouth...probably from smiling so much LOL. Anyway, this product seems to help and minimizes the lines."
"Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer OMG. This product is amazing. It went on so smooth. It wasn't too thick or runny. As soon as I put it on, it worked. It lasted the whole day. It didn't leave my face greasy or sticky. My makeup went right on top of it. Moisturizer lasted all day, right up til I took my makeup off, then I reapplied it before bed. It lasted the whole night. Finally,something that works. It is definitely a little pricey for just a moisturizer but it is well worth it."
"Visible Improvement In Skin Elasticity I hardly ever take time to write reviews but since this product worked so well, here I am. I'm in my early 40's and starting to notice a loss of elasticity in my neck area. Before using this cream I could pinch my neck skin and instead of popping back into place like it used to, it would stay like that for a few seconds. Within 2 days of using this cream am"
Best Moisturizer Ever!!!! I am 63 years old have never found a moisturizer i love more. Am so glad this product came out and I will buy it for the rest of my life!
"Amazing Results The First 2 Days!!! I'm a side sleeper and I had a deep groove on my right cheek. Nothing has helped it. I'm 54 and really looking for products that work. In less than 2 days, I was looking in the mirror and there was not a sign of this deep groove that was 3 inches long in a weird spot on my right cheek. i wish I would have taken before and after pictures. I'm buying all 3 products in this line. ladies, IT WORKS!!!"
Fantastic Moisturizer!! I think this is a wonderful product. It completely transformed my skin so it is no longer dry. You do not have to use a lot since it absorbs well and does not leave your skin feeling greasy. I look forward to buying the Triple Power Eye Cream to use with it.

Great Moisturizer I recently turned thirty and have been trying to find the product that works for me. I have tried several different products that have made my skin break out. The jar is very high end looking and a great color. A little of the moisturizer goes a long way. I have tried different products that made my skin look greasy this product made my skin look very dewy. This product superseded my expectations. My skin tone and texture has changed. This product has helped me used less foundation because my skin looks great. My blemishes are almost gone and I am so in love! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Awesome Product With A Good Price! I started using this product two weeks ago because I am trying to find a good moisturizer with a fair price. I am 48 years old with dry skin. My face gets chapped very easily. My skin just loves this product! I use it morning and night. It is easy to use, not greasy and calmed my skin immediately. This is definitely a keeper! I like the smell, but I found if you use it with the other Loreal Paris moisturizer line, it can be too strong. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"A Very Rich Face Moisturizer! I'm in my late 30's and really looking for a good moisturizer. This L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Active Facial Moisturizer definitely did the job. I really loved the consistency of the cream, it is rich and goes on very smoothly. A little does go a long way, so resist the urge to be heavy-handed with the product. It feels very rich on my face, without being heavy or 'too thick'. I like using this product at night as my nighttime moisturizer. I wake up the next morning and my skin feels incredibly supple and soft. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"All Around Great Self-Tanning Lotion! I have very fair skin so one application takes that paleness out of my skin and looks natural. This works great for build-up color too. Every new application brings added color. In the summer I will mix the Dark and Medium to obtain a deeper darker tan. If you're shopping around, definitely buy this. If you're not sure about the color buy both the Medium and Dark. You can't go wrong! I have tried almost everything on the market and this by far is the best! The scent is nice for a self-tanning lotion too."
Best Moisturizer Ever!! I have been using this product for over a week and I can already see and feel a difference! I really love the facial moisturizer! I have been applying this product at night before I go to bed and when I wake up my face still feels as soft as it did when I first put on the product the night before!

"L'oréal Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer Love the silky feeling, along with serum this has actually made a great difference in a weeks time, I am 60 and now been getting compliments on my skin, without a peel, good stuff people This review was collected as part of a promotion."
L'oreal Paris Revtialift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturiser I think the revitalift triple power deep facial moisturiser is awesome! Since using this product I've noticed that my skin is alot smoother and softer it also gives your face a pretty soft look love how it feels! I also tried the l'oreal Paris triple power concentrated facial serum treatment along with L'oreal Paris Revtialift Triple Power facial day lotion these three all togather will give you very soft pretty skin minus the Sun spots and wrinkles! I've noticed that the wrinkles that were on my forhead are definitely disappearing so it makes my skin look and feel alot younger soft and pretty! Ontop of that I had alot of Sun spots espically around my mouth and the darkness is gradually fading! I wish I knew about these products along time ago! Just a reminder when using it you only need a tiny bit of each product! Also make sure you keep using it I started seeing results after about a week I couldn't believe how well it works! Over all I'm very satisfied my face looks so much fuller healthier and soft before using these I couldn't say anything nice about my face and skin! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Moisturizing Magic This is by far my favorite Loreal Revitalift product. It is super thick and creamy but soaks in deep, does not leave your skin greasy or wet at all. I've been using this as an overnight treatment for 2 weeks and my skin appears smoother and healthy. The jar is huge so go ahead and lather it on and watch for the magic. I love this and can't wait to see what happens in the next 2 weeks! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love The New L'oreal Products! The moisturizer has improved the look and feel of my facial skin after using it along with the serum and lotion. I've been faithfully applying it morning and night and love how little product it takes to cover the entire face and neck areas I was a little apprehensive at first since it is a more expensive product but I can see now it will last quite awhile because of the absorption qualities of the product. Definitely will continue using these L'Oreal products in the future!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Totally Surprised I must honestly say i was a a doubting thomas. Most products of this sort make all these claims and fall short of their promises. This product however does what is says it will do . I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for the past three days am and pm like it tells you to do. I must say i'm surprised , I have noticed my skin tone evening out , my skin is smoother. I would recommend this product to anyone, proudly i might add. It's always nice to come across a product that does what it says it will do. I have included an before and after photo to show the difference . I hope you all can see it . I'm afraid my photo skills need work This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Skin So Soft This moisturizer has done wonders in the 2 weeks that I have used it. My skin feels softer, smoother and refreshed since using this product. After applying, I usually wait 5 minutes before putting on make-up. It has helped a lot to keep those dry spots under control. Quick tip: You don't need a lot when applying, a little will go a long way. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Deep Acting Wrinkle Magic Eraser... , I can't get over how amazing these products are, I've been using this product along with the concentrated serum treatment , I have to say I'm extremely satisfied with the results , I've been using this product about 2 and a half weeks. My face feels great, looks great and my skin feels night and tight! I would highly recommend these products to all... give it a try! I promise you won't be let down..... This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice Moisturizer I use the L'Oreal Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer every evening before going to bed. A little goes a long way, and it applies easily. My face feels moisturized as soon as I put it on, without that sticky feeling. What really impresses me is how my skin looks and feels in the morning. I wake up to really smooth, soft skin. This moisturizer works well on my slightly sensitive skin. When I don't need a sunscreen product, I'll be using this in the morning too to keep my skin looking good. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Amazing How Much I Glow I have been nervous to use any kind of moisturizer on my face because my skin on my face has always been very clear. I am so happy that I did. This stuff is truely amazing. Its even more amazing how much it made my skin glow. It just seemed more healthier. My face has never felt this great. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love this product! I purchased the deep dark color since the store I was shopping was out of the light/medium, but I was so happy that I did! The color looks great and gives a nice, natural tan (not orange). It goes on like a lotion so it doesn't leave streaks. I have tried other products like L'oral and Clinique, but I prefer Banana Boat for the price, pleasant smell, and quality!"
L'real Spf 20 This is a nice finishing touch product. Love the creamy texture and smell of the product. Non oily and non drying product. I've used some spf products that have left my face feeling dry and cracked this product didn't. My face is soft and is not left with a shine. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

Great Product I love this lotion! it is a thicker cream you put on after the serum in the morning and at night after you cleaned your face. my face is sometimes affected with acne and it is just amazing how it cleaned it up! my skin feels so fresh and moisturized!

Another Great Product I have been using all three of the products for over a week. I like to use the products together because I think they make my face healthy. The moisturizer is nice and not too thick. The scent is nice too. I feel these three products from L'Oreal are worth the money. The amount that we get for the cost is reasonable. I like the deep acting moisture in this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Great Moisturizer I think this moisturizer is a great product. I've been using it twice daily. I use it in the morning and at night before bedtime. My skin feels very hydrated and appears to have a glow. The appearance of my skin is definitely healthier after using this product. My skin feels very soft to the touch. I absolutely recommend this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love This Stuff I absolutely love this moisturizer! Being that I have sensitive skin and get dry spots in the winter months due to hot showers and weather, this product is GREAT!! It makes my face super soft and a little goes a long way. It does what its suppose to do, my face hasn't been dry in weeks and looks great. My breakouts have even stopped! Yay!

"Great Moisturizer I use this one in the evening after cleaning my face and applying the facial treatment serum. I let the two work overnight and wake up to a soft feeling skin. At first I was reticent, but after using it for almost two weeks, I think I can see some results. I plan on using it for a while and compare results after a month or two.

"L'oréal Paris Revitalif Triple Power I wanted to thank bzzagent and L'Oral for sending me this product. I wanted to waite 2 weeks befor I did this review...can I say amazing!. I tired the Revitalift triple power day lotion moisturizer spf 20,Deep-Acting moisturizer and concentrated serum treatment. The serum is the first step when you apply the concentrated serum which is used for a day and evening second step is using the concentrated serum treatment which that is for day and evening as well and third is the day lotion which is only use for in the morning time. This product is very different from any moisturizer that I use before it is non-greasy and absorb to my face very well. I can see the difference once I apply it to my face and brightens it up. Just a few dab on the face to smooth out every morning and evening. It feels like that I don't have anything on my face and the finish is very smooth and a light fresh smell. I have notice a difference after using this for two weeks and I seen a difference in the reduce of fine lines that started to appear under my eyes. this will definitely reduce overtime and my skin looks great. I recommend and to try these products out. Being a woman specially over 30 you always want to look your best and feeling younger so I recommend any women to try this out. You will not be disappointed. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Worth Buying! I have tried several moisturizers over the years, but I have finally tried the last one! I will not buy another brand! I feel my skin's softness all day long.

It only takes a little bit for my skin, and so I know it will last a while! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Day - Night Lotion I don't usually use products available in stores but decided to.give this a go because of the product name and reputation.

"L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer Triple Power. Yeah you can say that again! First the moisturizer sinks into my skin and became invisible(showing no white lines). Second, The Hyaluronic Acid did not sting or cause redness on my face, which i have had trouble in the past with other products like this. Third, my face felt good, smooth, refreshed like it use to. Can't wait to see more results with further use. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love this stuff Nothing works like this. Have problem finding it.
"Perfect Night Cream! I think the thick, creamy feel of this moisturizer is luxurious. It glides on smoothly, absorbs into my skin well. After using this for only a week, my skin definitely feels softer, smoother, and more hydrated. I think the deep-acting name fits this product because I feel like it really penetrates my skin to repair and moisturize. I haven't noticed a lift yet, but I will continue to use it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Amazing Moisturizer I have been searching for a facial moisturizer for quite some time. My search is over. I have been using the L,Oreal Paris revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer for a little over a week and am very impressed at how hydrated/moisturizer my face is. A little went a long way and it was not greasy. This is now part of my daily routine. I have and will continue to recommend this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Excellent Product I was super excited to get these L'Oreal products and they did not disappoint one bit. I feel like i prefer I serum that is see through. But that's just my preference. This does really prepare my skin for my makeup products. It makes my skin look and feel very soft and super smooth. It smells of soft flowers but it's not offensive. As far as repairing...I haven't used it long enough. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Facial Moisturizer I really enjoyed the moisturizer application to my face. My skin really, really felt more refreshed. When your skin feels good I think your face kinds of glows. I know I do. I really feel little sample packets that folks could try at the cosmetic counter would feel what I felt on their face. Your face just feels good. I hope you do this. This would really help. I know when I go to the counter I'm really overwhelmed by the abundance of products. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"I Love This Product! I tried the RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer and loved how it felt on my face. It felt very light, almost as if I had not put on anything at all. My skin did not get greasy after the moisturizer had been on for a while like it did with my other moisturizer. I also love the smell of this moisturizer. I really enjoy using this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"New Favorite Moisturizer! I have tried many moisturizers over the years, and Loreal Paris Triple Power ranks among the highest for me. There is no need to reapply throughout the day, as the initial application leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day long. I have been using the product for 1 week in conjunction with Loreal Paris revitalift serum, and both products have been just as described. As the packaging claims to see younger looking skin and increased elasticity after 4 weeks, I cannot attest to the results. I can say that in my 1 week of use, the overall texture of my face is indeed smoother! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My Skin Hs Never Been Better. I have to admit, I've never been one to mess with my skin. That being said, I'm overjoyed that this product/s has surpassed my expectation.

"Love That Added Sunscreen! I just started using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer last week. I am 36, and I am just starting to see some fine lines around my eyes. I can't speak to whether it improves fine lines or wrinkles yet, because I have only been using it for about a week now. But I'll tell you about what I've noticed about the product so far. Pros: -It goes on light and absorbs well into my skin. I hate heavy, greasy products. This is not greasy or thick. -It has added SPF 30 sunscreen. This is SO important in a daily moisturizer, and definitely will help prevent wrinkles. -I had some acne spots on my face when I started using this product. I did not have any additional breakouts as a result of using this product. -Although the 1.7 oz bottle seems small, you only need a very small amount to cover your whole face. I think this one bottle would last me a couple months. -The packaging is very cute! I love the deep red and purple colors. Cons: -The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power system involves using at least three different products. It can be expensive to buy all three products, and it's a bit of a hassle to use all three over the course of a day. If you like using multiple products, it's not a big deal, but for me, I think I'd prefer a more simple routine. -It is a scented product, which may not be appropriate for sensitive skin. The scent is nice, though--a light, clean scent, and it is less overpowering than some other products I have tried. Overall: I liked this product a lot. I think it worked well for my skin, and I would recommend it to others. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Surprisingly Lightweight I believe that L'Oral triple power DeepActing Moisturizer is true to it's name. I used this moisturizer in conjunction with L'Oral triple power serum and together they made magic on my face. I chose to use it at bed time because I truly wanted to test the product and give my honest opinion with the effects of makeup. I was mostly impressed at the non greasy and lightness of the moisturizer. My face looked and felt hydrated in the morning, so I know the product worked. This is a definite win for L'Oral.

"Excellent Moisturizer As in my other reviews, I should start off by telling you my skin type, I think that is very important in understanding if my review will be helpful to you. I have fair skin but tan very easily, more oily than dry and have occasional breakouts and am in my mid-30's. Using a heavy moisturizer has always been a terrible adjustment for my skin because of the oily sensitive nature of it. But I wanted to give this moisturizer a fair chance. It was very thick compared to what I normally use and comes in a jar (which is convenient for getting every last drop of the product). I was amazed for how thick this was (it is definitely more a cream than a lotion), that it blended in quickly to my skin and the only thing that was left was soft skin. There is no oily residue or even any trace that I put it on (except for the softness of course). The scent is the same as the other produces in the Triple Power line, pleasant and not overpowering. I use this in the pm and the first few mornings I woke up with more than normal oily skin. That was expected because my body needs a chance to get used to the chance and to figure out it's oil balance...the more moisture your skin gets the less oil it needs to produce so when you start using a cream or lotion your body will learn to produce less overtime. Now I have no problem and my skin is very soft and visually looking better. And no breakouts! Yay! Its been several weeks since I've started using this and 2 other L'Oreal products in the RevitalLift Triple Power line (Concentrated Facial Serum and the Day lotion moisturizer SPF 20 which I have also reviewed) and absolutely love all three. I would definitely recommend this and the other products in this line! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"2 Birds - One Stone! This facial moisturizer is amazing :) It has a thick, luxurious feel as it goes on and leaves my skin feeling hydrated AND looking younger and more vibrant. It is non-greasy so no need to cover my face in powder after I use it. The fine lines around my eyes are significantly less visable. I will be purchasing this product regularly in the future.

Leaves Skin Smooth I have been using this product for a week. I apply it before I go to bed and it really does make my skin feel smooth. It is so creamy and easy to apply. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"My New Moisturizer This is something I can use every day. I like to use it before and after bed. The feel of it is great. It dries quickly, so I'm able to put my make-up on fairly quickly after I put it on. It makes my face feel smooth. The best part is that it doesn't feel heavy, and that it isn't hard to spread. I think this is my new must-have moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
How Can You Not Love This?! I think I am in love! I have been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for a couple weeks and my face is so much softer than when I started. It smells amazing and I have been getting compliments on how great my face looks. I have pretty sensitive skin and I've been able to use this with no problems. I have convinced my sisters and mom to purchase it and try it themselves. This is such an amazing product! I'll definitely buy more when this runs out! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Skin Feels Great! I am shocked at how much better my skin looks and feels already! The lotion is very thick and creamy so I was a little worried it would break my face out but it hasn't at all! It does not feel heavy on the skin and dries quickly. I like to light smell, does not smell chemically. I have been using it in the morning and at night and within a week my skin felt completely different and I could see a difference around 2 weeks. It takes a very small amount so it should last a long time! It is definitely something I will add to my daily routine from now on along with the concentrated serum and SPF lotion. They definitely work great in combination. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer I loved trying this. Smells good and it goes on smooth. There's nothing about this that I didn't not like. I'm not big on using more than one thing when I'm cleaning my face. But using this with the concentrated serum works great together. I was skeptical at first, but the more I use it the more I like it. I'm definitely sticking with these. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Thick And Rich This jar of facial moisturizer may appear small in size, but is so powerful I only need a small amount on my fingertip to make a noticeable difference. I apply this in the morning and night to my entire face and neck. After just two weeks of use, I see my neck showing fewer signs of aging. Less lines, less saggy looking. I have fewer lines around my mouth and eyes, too. Plus, the moisturizer absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves me with a beautiful smooth, radiant glow that gives me confidence. Thanks L'Oreal!

L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer (1.7 Oz) I've been using Avon products for about a 3 months. I barely started noticing a difference.

"Don't Spend $ On Department Store Moisturizers Please! I have tired dozens of brands of moisturizers -- Lancome, Estee Lauder, Elizabeth Arden, L'Occitane Devine and L'oreal products. The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer has the same effect or even better results for me. The moisturizer is rich and thick but doesn't feel sticky at all. I love the fact that it feels rich and expensive. I also love the way it goes on my neck and chin. I've been using it everyday since I've gotten the product and I have noticed a smoother texture to my neck and chin. I also use it as a moisturizer in the morning. I put it on after I wash my wash then I have my breakfast. I then put my makeup on and go to work. It can also act like a makeup base because it makes my foundation go on smoother and my skin looks very polished and professional. I don't think I'll use anything else.

"Triple Protection I basically restarted my daily routine and added in a seem which I've never used before. Initially, I was very excited to try them all and got myself back into the routine. I liked the cream and moisturizer because they were not oily or slimy, very easy to apply and had almost instant results. My skin feels softer and smoother after using them and I feel like my skin is getting extra care and protection. I don't have bad wrinkles or age spots yet, but I like the idea of preventing them and I have confidence in this product. The serum was new for me but I feel like it did it's job and helped to really clear up and heal my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Worksgreat My aging skin is very dry in some areas. I also have some brown spots which are normally very dry. after the first day, I could tell a difference in my skin. It was softer and smoother.

It only takes a little each time you use it so it will last longer than you think. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"My Thoughts On L'oreal I used the facial moisturizer and I must admit that I didn't like it at first but that is because clearly I used too much. A lot goes a long way with this and when I put less on, my skin felt fantastic! I love this as it moisturized and didn't make my skin feel oily. I will definitely purchase this product.

L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer Is Unbeleivable I have been using this moisturizer for about a week everyday and love it. After the very first use my skin felt amazing. You only need a small amount to moisturize your entire face and neck. I am a former smoker and have been looking for a product that will bring that youthful glow back to my skin and this product does the job. I can not wait to see the results after further use of this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Sunscreen Is My Life I actually love this sunscreen! It smells great and it works. It doesn't hurt that the bottle was lovely. I used this product in conjunction with the Serum and My skin felt smooth and never dry. I do have very sensitive skin and other than a slight tingle that went away after a day or two, I had no problems! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This Is A Must Try I am always a skeptic when it comes to moisturizers. Will it leave me with red skin Will I be greasy Even worse will it cause breakouts Well I can definitively saw the L'Oreal Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer doesn't causes any of those worries. This cream is gentle and light and leaves my skin refreshed and glowing. I couldn't be more in love with the Triple Power Products!! Run out and try them for your self.

Loreal Does It Again I love this product and the brand as well. The moisturizer is wonderful and I could feel and see a difference after just a short bit of using it. I would definitely recommend this product and most any of their products. I have never been disappointed. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great Moisturizer I've always been a fan of L'Oreal skincare products and this is no exception. I love finding a moisturizer that is great for both day and night and moiturizes well without being greasy, this fits the bill! The scent is light but pleasant and it's very comfortable on the skin. I put on a bit more at night for extra moisture, but it works great day or night! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Marlea Bowser I love this Facial serum. Gives me soft smooth skin. I've used it for 10 days now and my skin feels great and looks younger ! I will continue to use this. I am a tennis coach and get a lot of sun on my face . This product is taking away that weathered looking skin. Thank You This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Hip Hip Hooray!!! What can I say, I am in love with this Moisturizer!!! It's silky when you put it on, it makes my skin feel dewy and soft. I love the way my dry face feels smooth and supple. I can see a huge difference after using this moisturizer for a short amount of time, already. I do use this twice a day. Living in the harsh heat of Arizona really dries my skin out and this product is working like a miracle. Yep, I'm a fan for life!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Two Thumbs Up! I love this product! I instantly noticed softer, more hydrated skin. I just love it. No greasy feeling and no heaviness. I am thrilled with the results this far and plan on continuing to use it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Silky Smooth This L'Oreal Triple Power Deep Acting Day/Night Moisturizer with hyaluronic acid is awesome! It's thick and rich, a very creamy moisturizer that brings to mind deep-penetrating body creams. It goes on smoothly right after using the L'Oreal serum, and feels silky and luxurious. It absorbs quickly, and I wait a few minutes before putting on foundation, but makeup goes on wonderfully with no,clumping or smearing after the morning use. I put it on before bed as well, after cleaning the old makeup off of my face. By morning my skin looks plump and refreshed. Used as a system with other L'Oreal products, so far I've had excellent results. My wrinkles are diminishing and my skin looks far more clear. This formula may also work well for those with sensitive skin, as I normally break out from many products, but have not had a single issue with this L'Oreal line. My one suggestion for improvement would be to put an interior thin plastic lid on the cream under the twist-off lid. My cream was delivered upside down, and all the cream had pooled into the top of the twist off lid, making for a bit of a challenge getting it back into the container. It also appeared to only be about half fullL'Oreal might want to consider filling the container more completely. Otherwise, this product has been perfect and I'm looking forward to seeing results at the end of 8 weeks or so. I've also been finishing up,with L'Oreal Triple Power facial Day lotion with SPF 20, so my review on that will be coming up, but so fat that is great as well.

"Smells And Feels Great I was impressed by this product. It is not to oily, not sticky and the smell is soft and nice. After a week of use my skin feels a bit softer than before and the product does not feel heavy. On a bad cold day I used twice because my skin was super dry and I like how it feels after used This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Moisturizer I have been using this product for over 10 years. It started as a quick-fix tanning solution. I loved the way the smooth texture glided over my face. Ten years later and I am still using it daily and year round. I am 57 years old and have been told I look like I'm in my mid 40's!!! Thank you Banana Boat, for keeping it simple... Who'd of thought!! )"
"L'oreal Paris Revitallift Triple Power Deep-acting I received this product a little late due to travel, but have been using it for the past couple of days. Here are some of the things that I really like about it so far: 1. Goes on smooth 2. No Stickiness 3. Nice smell to it. 4 . A little goes a long way I can't wait to see if I continue to using it will it really improve my aging. It does seem like my skin has a nice glow to it. More to report back on after more use.

"Better Than A Spa Day I will and am going to continue this L'Oral facial regimen. I have been looking for this type of combination for a while without success. The L'Oral Paris Revitalift Trio. Two day creams , two nightcreams , and a sunscreen I use over my make up. My skin feels and looks better and is just more comfortable. I think this is a wonderful product and have been using it just a short while. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Thick And Creamy The Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer was followed by the serum and was equally smooth in texture and was pleasant in smell. It was a thick consistency and I felt it truly moisturized my skin throughout the day without leaving it greasy. I was especially pleased with the way my make-up applied after I allowed the moisturizer to soak into my skin. My foundation glided on without caking up, which I have not found to be the case with other moisturizers. I cant really speak to the anti-aging component, since it was used along with the serum, but I believe the two products together made my complexion more balanced. I have a normal skin type, not dry or oily. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
My New Favorite Facial Moisturizer Only used product one week and love every step of it. All 3 work well together and gentle on skin. Usually this time of year my skin gets extremely dry and burns. Will not have to worry using this product. Smells and feels good on my skin! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Finally A Product That Works! I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for a little over a week now and I am so impressed! I used it after i washed and cleansed my face before bed and when I wake up in the morning my face is so smooth. This makes for an easier makeup application in the morning. This product goes on smooth and absorbs fast into your skin with no sticky after effects. My skin felt so moisturized! I definitely recommend this product for people looking to smooth out their skin and moisture their face. Plus it smells great! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Love This! What can I say This stuff is amazing. If you are wanting to hydrate your skin, especially during the winter season, this is the stuff right here, It has the creamiest texture and feels like soft butter. I may or may not have warmed it up in a bowl of warm water before applying ( I totally did). It has a fresh clean scent so when I am applying it to my face, there is no overpowering perfume or chemical smell. I have been using it for 5 days now and my face has never been so soft and dewy from actually absorbing the moisturizer. I use it both morning and night and am probably adding it to my skin care regimen permanently. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Good So Far! I have been using the facial moisturizer for a few days now. I really like the smell and makes my skin feel good. I can't wait for another 4 weeks to see the results. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great Nightime Moisturizer I really enjoyed using this moisturizer. I'm a bit of a skincare and makeup snob and usually stick to mid to high end brands. I think this is a really great product, especially for something that you can get at the drugstore. This consistency is a little thick and very moisturizing but didn't leave me greasy. It sank into my skin very quickly and my skin was soft to the touch. I haven't had any breakouts from it either. I've only been using for a little while so it's hard to judge the different it's made in my skin but I do think it's on par with many higher end moisturizers. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Clean Non Greasy Feeling I think that this is an amazing product. L'Oral Paris Revita lift facial moisturizer is great, I have very sensitive skin and actual avoid trying new products for fear of a strange reaction. I am so glad I tried this my skin feels better and even my husband noticed a difference, he's a truck driver so he's gone most of the time. I am very happy with the product. I will definitely purchace this regularly thank you BzzAgent for the opportunity to try before I buy. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
L'oreal Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer I have been using this moisturizer daily in combination with the L'Oreal Revitalift serum and I am very happy with them so far! The product goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. It does not leave any greasy residue. So far I feel like my skin looks more bright and healthy! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"A good buy This product is amazing. I had a ridiculously white belly and the rest of my body was tan! I was going to the beach and 2 days and just the sun alone couldn't help me get a tan that fast. So, I went online and read about this product. I went to wal-mart and decided to try it out for myself. And truthfully, this product works wonders! It adjusted to my skin tone and it didn't make me look orange. My belly actually matched the rest of my body for once. It took one application to notice a difference. It's so simple and easy to use too! Seriously folks, if you need a tan on one part of your body then use this. It works best if you apply it more then one time, but you can notice a difference immediately. It works wonders. Buy this is you need a good tan!"
"Amazing Moisturizer I love this moisturizer! It's light, not super heavy feeling. Makes my skin feel so soft and moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great Moisturizer! This moisturizer worked really well. I loved to pair it with the serum to really give a good one-two punch for my skin. It felt light and not sticky or greasy at all. Highly recommend this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Pleasantly Surprised! I have tried all kinds of serums, mainly high end deluxe samples from subscription boxes. I have to say that I'm loving the L'Oral Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. I am 40, and though luckily I don't have any visible wrinkles yet, I want to keep it that way. I have very dry skin, especially in the winter time. I also have something called sebaceous hyperplasia, which is tiny little bumps on my forehead and on my cheeks right next to my nose. Nothing seems to make them disappear totally. This serum, in combination with the other L'Oral RevitaLift products, seems to take care of both of those issues for me. My face feels so soft and smooth and I have noticed a reduction in the bumps. My one issue with this line of products is the scent. While the scent is pleasant, I would have preferred it to be unscented. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Excellent Moisturizer I think this is the best product for those with dry skin. I have used this product daily and will continue to use this product in place of another moisturizer that I have used.

I don't have anything but pros about this product: absorbs quickly, goes on smoothly, moisturizes well, not greasy, and lasts long. I would strongly recommend this product to a friend This review was collected as part of a promotion."

This Is Amazing Moisturizer! I love this moisturizer! It goes on easy and smooth. It doesn't make my skin feel oily or greasy. The fragrance isn't overwhelming and is just right.

great!! i got this product and it went on really well...i got the deep dark color....after applying 3 hours later i was dark..but in a good way it looked like ive been on the beach and got a good tan....
"So Surprised. I think this is one of the best moisturizers I've ever tried. I have dry skin year round,and this really surprised me. I've tried a lot of moisturizers before,and they usually made my skin feel somewhat oily. They just didn't really feel great at all. This product went on smooth,never felt oily or sticky. And it made my skin feel great,so soft and refreshed. I feel like even when I wear this everyday,it never feels oily,and my skin isn't flaky at all anymore. I highly recommend it to anyone who has really dry skin and wants an overnight change. That's how fast it worked for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Like The Product I love the way my face feels and looks clean and healthy after using the cream thank you LOreal for the free sample I will continue to use the product to see more change to my skin This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Found My Favorite Night Time Moisturizer! I absolutely love the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer! It's worked wonders for me, especially combined with the serum. I use this at night after I wash my face. I wake up with soft and glowing skin. I've searched high and low for the perfect night cream/moisturizer with the benefits I need and so far, this it it. It's not too heavy of a cream, which is important to me. It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy at all like some products. Which is also important to me since I'm prone to breakouts. It's very moisturizing and my skin looks very healthy since adding this to my routine. I'm very excited about using this with winter coming up, I get dry patches in areas of my face and I think this will end that. My skin looks more youthful and fine lines are less noticeable. My eyes, my forehead, and around my mouth look much better, you can really tell a difference. I highly recommend adding this to your routine. You can probably do away with a lot of other products you use to achieve the same result with just this and tell serum! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Sharing The News Had some neighbors over for lunch yesterday. Always looking for and learning about new products we have tried. I told my neighbors how amazing this deep acting moisturizer is. Yes, they have tried many before. I showed them how good it felt on my face and let them try for themselves. There is nothing better than feeling a product before you buy. I feel this is a superior moisturizer with great results. I love that it absorbs immediately and is not greasy. I am looking forward to hearing from my neighbors how much they see a difference after buying LOreal This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer I have tried the moisturizer for 2 weeks now, and I really like it. The cream spreads very easily and a little goes a long way. It leaves skin feeling very soft and smooth without feeling thick or heavy on the face. Already my skin looks brighter and feels hydrated all day. It has a very pleasant smell but it may be a little strong for some people. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Works Great No greasy feeling, rubs in nicely with out having to reapplying. Noticed a difference with in a few days in the problem spots on me forehead. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Super Soft I think that the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is AMAZING! I have been using it at bedtime for about 2 weeks and I love it. I'm prone to dry spots on my face. Since using this moisturizer, I haven't battled those dry spots! I was a bit skeptical at first because it is a heavier moisturizer. In the past, my skin has become greasy and has even broken out when using a thicker cream. Not so this time! It is quickly absorbed but not in a way that I feel like I need more on right away. It also has a pleasant scent that is not overpowering. As for the product's claim to diminish dark spots, I haven't noticed a difference yet. But, I do love the texture of my skin after starting to use this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My New Favorite! This L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is my new favorite face cream of all time. I am 75 and I used to use L'Oreal skincare products all of the time and loved them in fact they were all I ever used but at some point I stopped using them. Obviously at 75 I am going to have some issues with my skin, personally I think that I have pretty good skin for my age but this cream really did tighten my face up really well and I think that my wrinkles and fine lines look so much better! I love every single one of the products that I was sent but this one is definitely my favorite and I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for some tightening and filling on the skin with lots of moisture! This for sure compares to my high end products. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Light And Felt Great Love this product and I think other women would too. Very light. Not oily like other lotions. Also I have very sensitive skin and I didn't break out. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"L'oreal Rocks I love L'Oreal products and have my entire life. When I found out I got this mission I was ecstatic. Each product is wonderful. When I first opened this product the smell was the first thing I noticed. It smells rich and it smells effective. But wait until it goes on your face. Your skin just laps it up and thanks you by looking fresh and relaxed and younger. I just know that this product works for my skin and face, and I love it. Anti aging is what it is all about these days. The population of baby boomers is huge, and we all want to look younger. I am constantly seeking products to give me a boost. To get rid of wrinkles and sagging skin. L'Oreal Revitalift is the product for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I LOVE IT!!! After reading many positive reviews, I decided to give this product a go. I had an extremely pale belly and legs. After only one application, my skin has a tan. I absolutely love it and will continue to use."
"Face Felt Smoother Than In A Long Time This moisturizer is amazing! I can't remember when my face felt this smooth. I kept feeling the smoothness of it during the day in disbelief. My biggest surprise was that it felt this way from the first day! Talk about fast-acting! Here in Florida the sun and salty air can play havoc on your skin, but this product seems to counteract that. I spend a lot of time outdoors and am glad to have this in my life now. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer Still loving this moisturizer. I have been using this daily for a few weeks now and I love the results. I am 46 years old and have dry skin. This is helping me get through the day without feeling so tight and dry. It really works as it should and keeps my face feeling soft and less wrinkles.

"Triple The Power! This moisturizer does back up its' claim as being three times the product! Immediately after applying, my skin does feel hydrated...as if the moisture is going right into the area, giving it a healthy glow. Also, the feeling, or texture, of the skin feels somehow smoother and softer. I will continue using this and am sure the other promised attributes will follow...younger and firmer facial skin is a great goal at my age....or any age for that matter!!

"Absolute Hydration If you are looking for a product that hydrates your skin all day, doesn't irritate you skin and also helps your makeup go on smooth and flawless then this is it. L'Oreal's Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer goes the distance This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer! L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is a god-send! I LOVE this moisturizer! I have used it for the past 3 weeks every night as my last facial product. I am a 3xs a week Retin-A user (for anti-aging) and my skin really needs a lot of moisture to balance out the drying effects of Retin-A. I like to use products that are a little heavier at night because my skin soaks them up throughout the night pretty well. Sometimes I feel like I need to use a moisturizer first thing in the morning as well because my skin usually feels pretty dry. I used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer on my face, neck and decollete. Sometimes I would treat my hands too. When using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer at night, my skin was surprisigly still pretty fabulously moisturized in the morning (versus other products I have tried). It is easily absorbed by my face without leaving any greasy traces. I love the light, fresh, floral scent too. The added bonus is the anti-aging ingredients that are added to this moisturizer: Pro-Xylane and Hyaluronic Acid. Together, these ingredients help my skin to be more radiant in the morning and nice and soft- a big win win in my book, especially since I am combatting dry Retin-A skin all the time! I felt like my skin looked more rested and therefore, more youthful. I did not use this moisturizer in my morning routine, but after these great nighttime results, I am going to try it out. The only thing I would change would be the packaging. The jar is beautiful, however, I would really like it to come with a pump so the active ingredients are not exposed to the air and the amount used could be more controlled. Lastly, I would definitely recommend L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer to a friend and will most definitely be using it on myself in the future!

"This Is A Winner I love this moisturizer . It leaves the skin feeling so soft and it still feels that way after all night. It states that it is deep acting and I can attest to that. My skin is so much smoother and more hydrated. I have used moisturizers forever and I must say this is one of my favorites as it works very quickly to soften and each time I apply, it continues to improve my skin's texture. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
I Love The Serum I think the serum is my favorite. It is night and absorbs in my skin quickly leaving no greasy or wet sensation. I have noticed a reduction in creases since beginning to use the product 2 weeks ago. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Like Putting Silk On My Face I've been using Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for a few weeks and I love the way it makes my face feel. I love the subtle scent and that it doesn't leave my face feeling sticky. I've always had dry skin which leads to breakouts but since using Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I've had almost zero breakouts. (I had one but that was due to falling asleep with my makeup on) I'll definitely be buying more when I run out but because you only need a small dab for your whole face, I doubt that will be anytime soon. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Treasure in a Tube I have been a sun worshiper for hears. Nothing makes you feel better or more self-confident than a natural tan. I purchased this product, and I have tried several thru the years. I have never gotten a more natural result. More compliments, or more questions as to where I went on vacation to get that tan! Don't change one blessed thing. With a busy professional work schedule, no time for the salon or beach per say, this is by far, the best product I have ever used in my years of self tanning. Keep up the GREAT and AWESOME work!!"
Loved This Product I loved the smell and my skin feels amazing after using the creme. I have extreme sensitive skin but I don't have any bad reactions to it. I live in Alaska and my face gets so dry during the winter time. This product has made it happened a lot less this year :-) This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Deep Moisture This goes on very smooth and I wake up to the softest skin in the morning. I love the thicker, whipped consistency of this moisturizer. It does not cause my pores to clog thus no breakouts for me. Just very soft, glowing skin. I look forward to doing my new facial regime. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Wonderful As A Night Cream And No Breakouts I love this product. It has a really nice light citrus/floral fragrance and does not feel oily. This moisturizer absorbs quickly into my skin and immediately leaves my face and neck looking younger. My face and neck feel very moisturized and soft after applying. I use this as a night cream and my face feel wonderful when I wake up. I haven't had any breakouts, which is sometimes an issue with moisturizers. I love the Loreal Paris brand and would recomend the Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"L'oreal Paris Rivitalift Triple Power Deep- Acting Facial Moisturizer Perfect with my combination skin! Leaves my skin smooth and breathable. No heavy or filmy feel, which I love!

L'oreal Revitalize Triple Power Cream This product is absolutely amazing. It is very light weight and doesn't clog your pores.

Hydration To My Skin Since trying out the Deep-Acting Moisturizer my skin is now really hydrated. I have some really dry spots on my facial area normally around my cheeks and jaw line. Those areas are now looking firm and radiant. I also noticed less of a wrinkle in between my brow areas. This product I recommend and is now going to be part of my beauty facial line.

"Worked Great On My Super Dry Skin. Although I didn't have very high expectations, I have to say that I was very pleasantly suprised at how well it worked. It has a very light pleasant scent and it left my skin feeling quenched and soft. It did not feel at all heavy or greasy. I would recommend. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I Really Like This One I have only used this in combination with the facial serum, however, so far I like it. I feel like it rubs in evenly and well with out too much work. It leaves my face feeling super soft and it doesn't feel heavy at all. The first couple days my face felt more oily to me, but after almost a week of wearing it now morning and night, that seems to have went away. I really like it a lot, and even though it is part of a set this is the one I would most likely keep using daily, or at least every night. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great product I have used this product for more than 4 years now. Its hydrated and causes no breakout on my face. I really like this product and will continue to buy and use it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Best sunless tanning lotion I've ever used I have used this product year around to keep a nice summer glow for 10 years, often i have people ask if I've been some where warm to get a tan and after they find out it's a lotion tan they're suprised. As long as you follow a few tips this it works great. I mostly use it on my face, When I use it on my face but i use a qtip to wipe excess around just the outside of my nostrils, on my eyebrows and along my hairline. When i use it on my body i apply it where you would normally get sun (ex the top of your arm) and blend it with plain lotion around dry areas of skin, especially the hands, feet and elbows. If you're applying to your arms and hands wash just your palms and inside of your fingers after applying with soap and lightly dry the tops of your hands and knuckles with a towel then use plain lotion on your palms and underside of wrist and blend for best effect."
"Clean-feeling Moisturizer I have always had dry skin and have needed to moisturize my face multiple times throughout the day so I wouldn't feel so crunchy. I've struggled for years to find something that does the job well and doesn't make me break out though. Within the first day of using the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, I could tell I was going to love it. It kept my face moisturized all day, break-out free, and didn't leave me feeling like there was a residue on my face like so many others have. To top it off, there is also a slight sheen to my face as well so even when I'm make-up free, I still feel like I can go out and feel good about how I look. I'm definitely a believer!

"L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer This cream can be used day or night, and it's sufficiently thick to be moisturizing, yet it absorbs very quickly. And my skin was left very smooth afterwards. The packaging is gorgeous a high-end looking glass jar in a rich red color, bronzed lid. All shaping up to be a very good choice for a moisturizer. It is easily absorbed by my face without leaving any greasy traces. As this is such a rich cream, I have only been applying it in the evenings, about half an hour before going to bed to give it a chance to get totally absorbed. My face feels soft and hydrated in the mornings. I find it a bit too rich for my skin for day use This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Awesome Sauce!!!!! I usually have big problems with moisturizers adding this oily/shine to my face that is absolutely not wanted. This moisturizer doesn't do that. It really sinks into your skin and doesn't disturb your make-up application. And, it is also amazing when I use it at night without make-up. I have combo skin (oily/dry) and I will continue to use this product after this campaign. It's awesome!!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

It stayed on all day and really helped my skin! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
The Best! I will never another self tanner unless I cannot find BB . I use the light medium and it is perfect for my fair skin. Just enough color for a natural look. Sometimes it's hard to find though. The very best on the market!
"Great Stuff After just two weeks of using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I can see noticeable changes. My skin is looking much healthier, younger, smoother and it feels great. Prior to using this product I was using a more expensive brand and I can tell you this one is working better.

"Great Product This facial moisturizer like others from the L'Oreal line works very good. I like it because is not greasy and you can use it alone or with other treatments. Not strong fragrance. You can see the difference, your skin will look smooth almost instantly. I have acne and this cream does not make it worse. I recommend it as well as all of these line products.

Great Moisturizer I will admit I am a face care product hoarder. This moisturizer isn't my favorite but it is up there. I've been using Loreal Deep Acting Moisturizer for about 2 weeks at night along with the other two loreal revitalift products in the package. This moisturizer is so rich creamy and yet blends and sinks right into my skin. With winter colder Temps coming up I'm looking forward to keeping ahead of dry winter skin. This has made the complexion of my skin much more even. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Great Product! I have been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for a few weeks. I use it in the morning before I start my day and at night after my long day. I must say this is the BEST facial moisturizer I have tried. It doesn't feel greasy at all, and the 'hydrated' skin feeling lasts all day for me! I use it once, and the fresh feeling lasts for HOURS! I don't need to reapply an hour or two later. My skin feels and looks smoother already! The scent is light and fresh also, that is a huge plus! I have already recommended this product to a friend of mine dealing with dry skin due to the cooler weather. The price is a little higher than other facial moisturizers, but you are getting what you pay for. A little of this stuff goes a LONG WAY! It's worth every penny! I give this product 5 out of 5 stars! It's awesome! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Lightweight But Works Loved the feel of this moisturizer, it didn't feel weighty but it worked wonderfully on my skin without causing any irritation or breakouts (I have very sensitive skin). I was hesitant given all the various products and recommendations in the marketplace but I trusted the L'Oreal name and loved that I could buy it anywhere! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Best Moisturizer On The Market! I have struggled for many years to find a moisturizing product for my combination skin and have been unsuccessful. That is until i received a sample of the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Deep Acting Moisturizer and Serum! These products are simply amazing. After just one application of both products, I noticed a major difference from the products i normally use. Although the moisturizer has a thick and creamy texture, it is very light after applying to the face. And also the fact that a little dab goes a long way, is a MAJOR plus for me! The combination of both products left my skin smooth, firm and moisturized all day. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. Great job L'Oreal!

You Gotta Try This I recently received this buzz kit. I got it in the mail and couldn't wait to try it. I've just turned 41 and beginning to see the first signs of aging.

"My New Go-to Night Cream I'm in love with this lotion that I can use day or night. I use it primarily as a night cream but when I'm feeling the day needs some super hydration I can put it on for day use as well. It goes on smooth and absorbs nicely. I appreciate the dewy complexion it gives me before I go to bed. I have not noticed any new break outs while trying this, in fact, it definitely has a calming affect on my skin that can be break-out prone. I had some acne scars above my eyebrow and they are WAY less noticeable. I believe it has also improved my skin texture. I am pairing it with other RevitaLift products and I really am enjoying the entire line up, they work nicely together and I am excited to see what the long term affects will be! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Natural color Goes on great and streak free. Natural color without baking in the sun. Not greasy and skin feels smooth . Nice summer color.
"Excellent And Rich Moisturizer I have combination skin and most moisturizers either are too heavy, leading to breakouts or too light, leading to dry patches. For me, L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer is just right. I've been using it for two weeks as my night time face cream with great results. The product comes in a jar and has a deliciously creamy and rich texture that feels luxurious on my skin and absorbs quickly. I had a small laser burn right on top of my lip that had been peeling and red for a few weeks so I was a bit worried to try the product. I am happy to report that not only did the cream not affect the burn it immediately helped it. Right after the first application the burn stopped peeling and became less red. I was convinced then and there that the active ingredients in this moisturizer truly moisturize. I have also noticed that my skin is softer and more supple. Two thumbs up for this cream! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I Love This Facial Moisturizer! This L'Oreal Facial Moisturizer is lightweight, non-greasy and smells great! I use it every night after putting on the L'Oreal Serum. Only a little bit goes a long way. The packaging has a a vibrant red color and the bottle fits perfectly in my medicine cabinet. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Smooth Skin! I've been using the moisturizer for a few weeks now. I hadn't noticed a difference in my skin but my 7 year old was on my lap the other day and snuggled up to my cheek.

"So Far So Good ! I tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment, L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion Spf 20. and I love all three of these products so far so good They come in nice deep red colored adorable container which i adored. To be honest I was a bit worried about trying these products at first due to I have sensitive skin but after using all three product for about two weeks I have to say i truly love these products they smell fresh and clean and go on smooth it didn't leave my skin dry or irritated which is great for someone like me with sensitive skin. I only had to use a small amount of product which went a long way which is awesome! after using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple power products it left my skin feeling smoother and clean, tighter and made my skin feel great . I will continue using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power and hope to see better results then i already have. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Silky Smooth I have always had a hard time finding a good moisturizer that doesn't leave my face feeling like I just played in an oil vat. The L'Oral Paris revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer is so far one off the best. It smells heavenly and feels heavenly. It leaves my skin so smooth and soft without the oily feel! I've only been using this product for a few days and I can see using it for even longer. I ran out of my lotion for my feet so I decided to use a little bit on my feet even though it's not meant for that, and it even helped my cracked, dry feet! I absolutely love this product!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Wonderful Little Tub Of Silky Smooth Goodness I think I'm in love. I have used the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer every night since I got my kit. I use it after I wash my face (with soap and baking soda) and use astringent. The astrigent dries up all the oil and breakouts but the Deep-Acting moisturizer makes everything smooth. My face is so soft after putting this one. It sets in and drys completely, quickly. It doesn't crumble off or peel. It doesn't make my skin itch or burn. It smells wonderful and did I mention how soft it is It's really really ridiculously soft. I find myself rubbing my cheeks after. It comes in a 1.7oz tub that will last a while. You don't need much it goes a long way. You can use it morning and night! I love this stuff. Really love it. I have not noticed an improvement in skin complexion or tightness yet but I've only been using this product roughly a week. Change takes time. But I can most definite see myself using this product for a long time. It is absolutely worth a try. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Rich Moisturizer I really love this luxurious facial moisturizer! I use it in the morning and before bedtime. I really like that my face feels so hydrated and very soft. I apply it on my face, neck, jawline and on the back of my hands. I am 57 years young and truly value the ingredients in this product. I like that one of the main ingredient is ( Pro-Xylane to stimulate collagen that we loose while aging and that this wonderful facial moisturizer replenish facial volume and has Hyaluronic acid to help fight wrinkles . I love the wonderful scent it has. I will continue to use because so far I really like how it feels and how it keeps my face hydrated and radiant. I have noticed that the first time I used this product my facial skin had flaked a bit but that happens because of clearing off the dry skin and beganing to repair. Love it!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Moisturizing Cream I was very surprised that this cream did not make my skin oily with so much moisturizer in it but is softened and lifted my skin. Great for a night cream after using the serum! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Amazing Results! I tried this out at the beginning of last summer because I was working alot and didn't really have the time to get tan-ready. The first time I used it, I used too much on my ankles and knees, so they looked kind of dirty. But the dirty effect wears off in a day or two. I absolutely love this product and it gives me an amazing tan color! I only use it about once week, (twice if i want to look a little darker) and it has lasted me quiet a long time! So I think it is a great deal and you really get a natural looking tan everytime!"
"I Don't Have To Moisturize All Day Anymore! I have extremely dry skin and I have always had to moisturize my face multiple times a day because the moisturizer I have been using wears off. I also have sensitive skin, so I have to be very selective about what I buy to use on my face. This product is like nothing I have tried before! For about two weeks before I started using this moisturizer, I had really dry patches starting to come up on my face. Within three days of using the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, they were gone! I will never use anything else on my face. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My Skin Feels Like I'm A Teen Again! This stuff is amazing. Thick, creamy, almost velvety. Within minutes I could see a glow about my face, as if I'd put on makeup. My husband even noticed. Just in the past week I've started seeing the fine lines around my eyes disappear. Will definitely recommend to friends. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Heavy Duty Moisturizer I am in my early 30's with combo skin and very few issues other than the early wrinkles an occasional dry spots. I have been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks and I really love it, it seems like a heavy duty moisturizer so I only use it at night, it can feel a bit heavy if you apply too much but I can see this working for someone with dry skin. The packaging is very luxurious and the scent is strong but it disappears within a few seconds after applying. Overall I'd recommend this product, I think it works better than other more expensive brands. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My Cranky Combination Skin Looks Happy! I've always had problem skin, with hormonal acne and combination areas. For some reason, moisturizer has never been on my radar. A few years ago I went to a dermatologist who told me that my skin would balance out if it had more moisture. I tried this product with the hopes that she was right and it looks like she was! I still have the hormonal acne, but my face looks calmer and definitely more hydrated. I love the creamy texture of the moisturizer and I feel like I'm pampering myself before bedtime and then again in the morning. On days when I was going to be outside I alternated using the Day Lotion instead of the Deep Moisturizer before my makeup in the morning. The glass jar is sleek and sophisticated. I will definitely repurchase this collection when I've used it all up. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Smooth & Creamy The Deep acting Facial moisturizer is a great product. I have been using it nightly for 2 weeks now. You can feel the moisture in your skin after using it. My skin looks 80 times better then it did.

"Best Cream Ever I think this is the best cream I have used. I use it over the serum and its not greasy or sticky. I use the lotion in the day with the serum, but sometimes I use the cream.Its so good that it does not make my foundation gross.Sometimes creams are to tacky and thick.I will tell you this is perfect. There is not one bad thing to say about this product. I will be running out soon, but a little goes a long way. I noticed my husband using it. And he say he really likes it.So I will be getting us more soon so we don't run out.Way to go Loreal...I use many of their products and I am never disappointed, I have already told my friends and family about it and they are going to buy it.Love it!!!!!!!!

Just a touch of color I have used this product year-round for a couple of years. I use it on my face/neck only and it adds just a touch of color. Perfect!
"Great Product I absolutely love this. I never tried it before I'll be loyal to this product. My skin is smoother than ever before. It's also like a primer, my make-up stays on perfect throughout the entire day! Now onto wrinkles, they've diminished a little, but then again, it's only been about 17 days, but it's more progress than with any other brand! All-in-all, very happy and would recommend this product to anyone! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"L'oréal Face I need to say that I'm 35 and live in Illinois. It's the beginning of cold weather, does alot of damage to my skin. I also am a waitress which then my skin can get greasy! This product couldn't be more spectacular. THe picture is of me with no makeup! The product itself is smooth and just thick enough that it has an everlasting feeling of hydration. The scent is an inviting and calming effect on me. MY skin is losing redness and becoming a beautiful tone as if I'm in my early 20's again! I believe this is a miracle cream! HANDS DOWN, the best I've ever put on my skin. IT will not leave your skin greasy but yet a soulful feeling. It won't leave your skin begging for more hydration either! Every morning and after I wash my face and I love my skin thanks to L'Oral products even their makeup! Bravo and thank you for the chance to be one that gets this and gets to promote it!

"Goes On Smoothly And Not Sticky At All It is lighter than the night cream or the serum I use. Also the smell is not as strong. I use it with the serum and it goes on smoothly over it. It does't leave a sticky feeling on your skin. After you put it on, you can see the shine on your face which makes the appearance of your lines or imperfection less noticeable. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer I used the L'Oreal facial moisturizer each day and my skin is so soft and silky.

I loved not having the greasy feeling after application. I was expecting to be greasy like other products. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"L'oréal Is Brilliant With This Triple Action Moisturizer! I have been using this product for a little over a week now, and it's simply brilliant. My skin is bright , less makeup being used, fine lines are lighter and harder to find. The smell of this product is light but wonderful. Moisturizer looks thick in jar, but is thin when applied and doesn't leave a greasy after look or feel. Simply leaves skin hydrated and brings great comments from people on how natural and un-flawed it makes my skin. Out of many jars of moisturizer I have tryed, this product is rated 1 for my skin.

"I Love It! This is one of my favorite facial creams. I love the texture. It's thick and smooth. I have a very dry and sensitive skin. So I have to be very careful with the products I use. L'Oreal RevitaLift Moisturizer feels very nice on my skin. It provides the desired moisture and calms my skin down in addition to smoothing wrinkles out. My skin feel very fresh and tight. I also like a lot the fact that it doesn't tighten the skin too much. In my opinion this is an excellent cream for women in the 30s. I apply the cream after my evening shower, and after the RevitaLift Serum Treatment. Results are amazing! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Gorgeous Skin 3 I would continue using the Loreal products such as the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer After only a couple of days using the product I woke up to smoother, softer skin. I have mature skin and started to notice a rough feel to my skin which was upsetting however the Deep Acting Facial moisturizer used nightly has started to completely reverse the dry rough feel to my face.

"Awesome Deep Acting Moisturizer!! I have been using L'Oral Paris Revitalift Deep Acting Moisturizer for 15 days and I honestly can't say enough great things about it! I have very sensitive skin and I have a hard time find moisturizer that doesn't irritate my skin, but I haven't had one issue with this product. It has a light airy fragrance that absorbs quickly and doesn't linger. The moisturizer is thick and creamy but is very light weight when applied. A little bit of this goes a long way! I literally dip my finger tip in the moisturizer and it covers my entire face. I've used this product two times a day for 15 days and you can barely tell I have used any of it. After I apply this in the morning, and let it dry, I apply my makeup on over top and it makes my face look flawless! It tightens my skin and smooths out the lines around my eyes and mouth. My husband has notice a huge improvement in my skin complexion and smoothness since using this product. I high recommend this product to anyone, no matter your skin top. I promise you won't regret it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Really Works! I've had issues with sensitive skin and acne for as long as I can remember. I was worried it would burn, or make my acne worse, or even make my face feel really greasy. It didn't do any of those things! After using this product, my face feels so hydrated, smooth and soft, and it feels tighter than before. While my face doesn't feel much less smooth, I definitely notice a difference if I forget to put this on. I haven't worn makeup for about 5 years now, and my face has always looked slightly red to me. Since using this product, I've noticed that my face no longer looks red, and my skin tone actually looks even for once! I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants their face to look and feel younger, softer, and wants an even skin tone, even those with sensitive skin! You won't regret it!

I will be trying more of this line and adding it to my daily routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My New Favorite Moisturizer I appreciated this moisturizer so much! It was light-weight and non-greasy. Once applied, my face felt rejuvenated and moisturized. My face did not feel dry after I applied the cream and continued to stay that way for the entire day. Some days I wore this underneath my makeup and felt that it did not interfere in anyway. I can easily see myself adding this moisturizer to my beauty routine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Sweet (Face)dreams I used the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer only at night and all by itself. I tested this as part of L'Oral's beauty trifecta -- three amazing RevitaLift products. My morning routine consisted of two of the others products (Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment Facial Day Lotion SPF 20). Those were really enough for each day, but I wanted something a little heavier at night. My wish was granted with the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. I apply the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer at night before bedtime and in the morning, my skin looks great. Gone are the dry eyes and blah skin. My face looks and feel well-hydrated and fresher each day. This lotion is just a little bit heavier than the other two, which is why it is perfect for nighttime use. It applies smoothly and easily and is not at all greasy or messy. This is really a jar of magic. I won't go to sleep without it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Softest Skin Ever!! This moisturizer leaves my skin silky soft and smooth ! Not only did my skin look more fresh and youthful , but it also seemed to stop the pores from being plugged up which has been a major problem as I age. I highly recommend this moisturizer !! By the way, I just turned 56 !! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Cleanse Fresh and clean face
"Loreal Is Now My Only Skin Care Before I started using this lotion, my skin had blotches and fine lines. You could not help to see my pores. Within days of starting to use this lotion, my pores looked smaller. The red blotches and wrinkles started fading. After several weeks my skin is evenly toned. Wrinkles are less defined. My face looks fuller and smoother. I have tried other brands before from department stores, and none have worked as well as Loreal. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Amazing Product For Dry Skin I think the L'Oral Paris recitalist triple power DEEP acting facial moisturizer is an amazing product! I have been using it consistently for the past two weeks and have seen amazing results! I like that you only have to use a little and it goes a long way! The texture glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly so it does not leave an oily or sticky residue. Although it may be a little expensive I think it may be worth it since it seems to last a long time even with daily use. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Loved The Moisturizer I shared the L'Oral Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer with my Mother. She liked it a lot and so did I. It replenishes our skin with the moisture before putting on our make-up. We enjoy using it for our faces. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Still Smooth The Next Morning I loved getting a chance to try this product! My skin felt unbelievably smooth with the first application, and that feeling lasted all day. I woke-up the next morning to skin that was still smooth even though I'd used a rough facial cleanser before going to bed it took 2 days of not applying the moisturizer before it felt like I needed to moisturize again. A little goes a long way when applying. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Will Buy Again!! I am 38 yrs old and have noticed a loss of firmness in my skin on both my face and neck. I also have always had a lifetime problem with oily skin and breakouts. I was concerned how my skin would react to this product considering what a heavy, and fragranced lotion it is. I'm very pleased with the results I've seen, especially on my neck, as it does appear more firm. Even though the cream is thick, it has not caused my skin to break out or have any negative reaction. The fragrance, however, can be a bit overwhelming and some people may be sensitive to it in those regards. I would have preferred a lighter, more absorbable formula in this line but will definitely will still repurchase as to maintain the increased firmness I've noticed in my neck! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Favorite Product Since I received the triple power deep-acting I haven't stopped using it day and night. I love it! It is light scented, easy and thin going on and doesn't irritate my skin AT ALL. On top of that, I've been using the product for a few weeks now and I've noticed my skin feeling and looking healthier, fine lines diminishing and my face feeling moisturized.

Nice Thick Moisturizer I was picked to try L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. Truly I'm impressed. This is my favorite part of my night time routine. After washing my face and applying serum to problem areas. This moisturizer is super thick. it only takes a very small amount. my skin loves it and soaks it all up. Makes it very soft. I will buy this forever. I love how smooth and hydrated my skin feels This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This Was A Moisturizing Experience I gotta say I was impressed with this moisturizer! This cream was a whipped cream for your face. It was not oily at all. Nor did it have a strong scent. After washing and a serum my skin feels pretty dry and when I applied this I could feel my face absorbing the cream. It's a really nice night cream but I must admit I used it in the morning as well under foundation and my face felt hydrated all day. Not greasy just soft plumper skin! After approx a week of using my skin felt softer and less dry after washing . I must say I will purchase this on a regular basis. I really have enjoyed using it and actually noticed a difference in my skin after a short period of time. LOVE!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"The Amazing Results Of L'oreal Paris Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer My skin is so soft now!!! I have lost a lot of the redness in my cheeks. I would recommend this product to every one. I used the L'Oreal Paris Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer in the morning and in the evening. Even applying over L'Oreal Concentrated Facial Serum the product was still light weight, and non greasy. Works perfectly under my make-up too. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Great Moisturizer! I am really enjoying using the L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer! It is a thick cream that works easily into my skin. I feel softer after. It does not leave my face feeling heavy or greasy though which is a plus. I have only been using it for two weeks but I can see a decrease in the depth of my forehead wrinkles.

"Surprised! I live in a very dry climate and I thought it was just something I had to live with, but I have found a product that really really helps. I like the feel of theL'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. It goes on smooth and does not feel to heavy to me. I don't like to feel covered up in lotion and this product fits the bill. I probably would have never bought this product without being able to try it first, but L'Oreal you have scored a new customer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Amazing Skin I have been using this product for 3 weeks and my face feels amazing. I love the smell and the non-greasy feel. I will definitely be buying this product in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
The best I was recommended this by my dermatologist when my skin was breaking out and I was on two different topical treatments that dried out my skin and made it peel. This is probably the most gentle cleanser you can find on the whole market and it leaves your skin feeling super soft and no residue left behind. Whenever my skin starts getting dried out and sensitive to other products I always use this until it's back to normal and makes the uncomfortable healing process much more pleasant. This in conjunction with the lotion is a miracle. Highly recommend if in need for something gentle and effective
"Love This Product My skin seems to get really dry during this time and year, and this product has been a godsend. I apply a light application after cleansing my face in evening and it absorbs quickly into the skin without residue. It leaves my skin feeling so hydrated and actually a lot firmer. The overall appearance of my skin has improved greatly. The slight scent is clean and refreshing. I would buy this product over and over again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"My New Favorite Night Time Product I have found my new favorite night time product. This stuff is amazing. My skin has never felt better. I wake up with soft skin whereas before I would have dry patches or an excess of oil. Not with this stuff. It is the perfect balance for my skin. I haven't been using it long enough to notice any real big changes, but I am noticing that my skin does appear a little softer, and maybe a little more even in tone and texture. I can't wait to see what it will have done after a month or two of use! Good job, L'Oreal! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I will most DEFINITELY buy again This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Life Changing This hydrates my skin perfectly, so much so that I don't need my face cream. If you have oily skin, it might be too much for you. After two weeks my wrinkles are smoothed out, my skin is more even and my makeup goes on super smooth on my former rough patches. The smell is nice, clean and crisp. I highly recommend this, especially for those looking for a good product on the cheap. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Really Like It! I started using L'Oreal's Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer about two weeks ago. At age 68, I'm lucky not to have too many wrinkles, but I do notice sagging skin on my face, so I've been looking for something that can make my facial skin firmer. I'm pretty sure I've found it in this product. I've been using it twice daily, once in the morning after my shower, and I apply it again before I go to sleep. The great thing about it is that it's not greasy, and it absorbs right away. After two weeks of constant use, I'm beginning to notice firmer skin and my face doesn't feel as dry as it was. Great product, and I'll continue to use it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"L'oreal Paris Revitalift Moisturizer I like it! After putting this on my face in the morning and evening, I started noticing a difference within a couple of weeks.

"Goes On Smoothly, Non-greasy I tried Loreal Paris Revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer for free through a bzzagent campaign. So what did I think of it Well, I've tried many moisturizers over the years, and I pretty much know what I like and dislike pretty quickly when trying a new brand of moisturizer. I like that this product smooths onto my skin easily, and doesn't leave me with a greasy feel to my face. I can't stand products that feel greasy, so it passed that test. Next, it works well to moisturize my face. We're heading into dry skin season where I live, and my face gets very dry. I've tried many products that just don't seem to leave my face feeling moisturized over the course of the day. This product really did, though. It soaks in really well, and just leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I Am Loving This Product! I've been stuck in a wholesale warehouse sized packaging rut of facial care. Then this campain came along and made me take a break. I am so glad it did. I don't wear make up and fall/winter can be harsh on my skin - dry, flaky red patches on my face. While using the serum and deep acting cream, I've noticed a huge difference. No dry patches, even skin tone, no redness and even less wrinkles ( or just maybe not as deep). I am loving this product and will continue to use it, even after this sample is all gone! Now what do I do with my leftover other brand moisturizer Any takers This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"Such Soft Skin!! This is my mom. She is going through chemo 2. Her skin is very dry. Before the chemo she talked about wrinkles, but not so much anymore. So when I had the chance to try these products I knew she'd be perfect for it!! She said her skin hasn't felt this soft in she can't remember how long. It looks and feels smoother and she has noticed a change for the better! She has used it for just over two weeksthis is her before (left) and after (right) pics so far. I can't wait to see how she feels as she continues her treatments! The regiment is morning and night and I know that was hard for her because she gets very tired these days. But she did it. Once she realized how much it helped with her dryness she didn't want to miss any days at all! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Got To Love It!! This triple power deep acting facial moisturizer is a very fast working product. I could feel it starting to work with the very first application. My skin feels smooth yet tight at the same time. I noticed the fine lines around my eyes starting to diminish after the first use and more and more every day. My crows feet are almost gone. My laugh lines are a little more stubborn. They are starting to be less bold now after a few uses of this serum and I am positive they will completely disappear with regular use of L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer and my skin is now so very soft. It reminds me of what my skin was like when I was in my late teens and early 20's. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Rich Soothing Cream I have been using 3 products together. The serum, the day moisturizer and this Triple power deep acting Facial moisturizer as directed on the boxes. I really like that you only need to use a small amount of the facial Moisturizer. I feel this product covers very well and absorbs quickly without out leaving a tacky feeling on the face. My skin feels great and even using all 2 of the products, I don't feel like there is too much on my face. They seem to work together very well. Now that this campaign is over, I will probably continue to use the facial cream at night only. It will replace another product that just didn't feel that good.

"Soft To The Touch My sensitive skin loves this night time moisturizer. It is gentle, softly fragranced, blends in quickly, yet works hard to keep my older skin soft, supple, and looking younger than its years.

"Review Of Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer I love this product. I have been using this moisturizer at night after using your cleanser.

"Moisture, Moisture, Moisture! I don't have that many wrinkles as yet but I don't want to wait for more to show up to begin working on them. If you are like me and is looking for a daily moisturizer that has the benefit of younger looking skin, then the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is for you. This product should be used in conjunction with the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment but alone, it is still awesome. If feels think and creamy between my fingers but goes on smooth and light. It leaves my skin looking and feeling well moisturized. The moisture last all day so I don't have to reapply. I live in a warm climate so I spend a lot of time outside and I thought this product would make my face oily but it does not. Overall, I really enjoy this product and will continue using it.

"This Is Sweet! This facial moisturizer rocks! At first the scent was a bit strong but has now dissipated with use. It is rich and creamy, not greasy and simply easy to apply.

"Makes You Feel Beautiful I loved this moisturizer. It was so creamy and silky going on then it took no time for it to absorb into my facial skin. Like all the L'Oreal products, it has a nice, clean scent. My skin felt beautiful and moisturized. I plan on using this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Favorite Product In The Revitalift Line! In my opinion, this is the best product in the RevitaLift line! This is an excellent moisturizer! A little goes a long way, which is always great when you're on a budget. I felt that this is the deepest moisturizer in this line and it's great as part of either your morning or bedtime routine. It is great base for women that have normal to dry skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Spa Quality Moisturizer I used the moisturizer after letting the serum soak in a bit. The product was so creamy and spread so smooth. I believe the product would last a fair length of time because a little goes a long way. The moisturizer made my skin feel so smooth and hydrated. I also believe that the wrinkles on my face are not as deep and it seems the small wrinkles are smoothing out. I would absolutely recommend Loreal revitalift. It is a high quality facial product.

"L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Regimen Step Two I used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer as the second step in RevitaLift Triple Power regimen. I apply the moisturizer around my eyes first then spread out evenly over my face. After 4 weeks of using the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer along with the Facial Serum I have noticed that the wrinkles around my eyes are very faint and seem to be disappearing the more I use it. My face looks so hydrated and revitalized. My face is soft, smooth, and silky to the touch. I am very pleased and will continue to use L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Power regimen.

"Product Review: L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer This product is my new-found favorite facial cleansing system regiment. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth, which is something that my facial skin was lacking prior to the start of my using this product.

"I'm Addicted To This The L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple power deep -acting facial moisturizer is a cream that I never want to be without again. The little jar it comes in looks and feels like luxury, and the product within is much better than anything I expected. The cream is rich and smells good, it's moisturizing without making my feel oily and gunky. I love using it in the mornings, and again at night before I go to bed. My skin just drinks it up and loves me more for it. My partner who barely notices any changes in my beauty routines cannot stop complimenting in how nice my skin looks and how good I smell when he comes to kiss me minutes after I've applied this. My skin definitely is getting more youthful I'm so happy to continue using it. I have recommend it to my mother who is in her early sixties. And after trying it out for a couple of weeks, she has only positive things to say! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Loving The Results I never realized how much I needed to start using anti aging products until now. Each day and night I have been applying the Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and the difference is very impressive. This product has made such an improvement of the elasticity of my skin and not only is my skin extremely moisturized but I have noticed a lot less wrinkles and fine lines. Even the daily dark circles have lighgtened. I have used other facial products in the past but never had the dramatic and amazing results as using Revitalift. This product comes in a classy glass holder and with just pea sized amounts used on my face, jawline and neck this product is bound to last quite awhile. The feeling of it is amazing without the greasy uncomfortable feeling I have had with other products. The scent is very pleasant and light. I really love the benefits of this product and intend on continuing to use it. Without the risks of plastic surgery or other procedures I am quite happy to continue to use Revitalift instead. Not only is it affordable but it is also a great product that will allow me to age gracefully and confidently without the dreaded aging signs. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I Love L'oreal's Revitalift Product Line! I was given the opportunity to try 3 of L'Oreal's Triple Power face products: the Facial Serum Treatment, the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer and the Facial Day Lotion. I am so excited that I tried these products. Before trying them my face was so dry. Nothing I had tried really worked, yes other products added a little moisture to my face, but you could still see the dryness through my makeup! I tried all 3 of these L'Oreal products together. First the serum, then the moisturizer and then the day lotion. The first day I used these products my makeup looked amazing!! The next couple of days I wore no makeup and my face felt so soft and moisturized all day, not oily and definitely not dry. I continued using these products together every morning for a week, then I skipped a few days and didn't use any of them and guess what My face was still very soft and moisturized! I love these products so much that I bought 2 more L'Oreal products, a cleanser and an eye treatment, to use daily with the other 3 L'Oreal products. I know that these products are also intended to help with wrinkles, but I don't really have any yet. Hopefully, these products will continue to keep my face wrinkle free as well as soft and moisturized! Thank you L'Oreal for making some amazing products!!!

"Great, Lightweight Moisturizer The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is a great, lightweight moisturizer for aging skin. I have oily skin and was concerned the moisturizer would cause breakouts or excessively shiny skin. After two weeks, I have not had any blemishes. It does make my skin really shiny, so I only use it in the evening. It is a very lightweight moisturizer that doesn't feel heavy or greasy. I saw immediate results in the texture and color of my skin, it looked smoother and more even. I would highly recommend this moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Normally my face stays dry especially this time of the year but after applying the moisturizer my face stayed soft and hydrated all day and night. Even fine lines seemed to fade. I will keep using this product and will be recommending it to friends and family. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Triple Power Action Revitalift I think this product is nice on its own but all 3 products together make a bigger difference. I love the way it goes onto my skin and makes it feel softer. I can see a difference in the fine lines and what few wrinkles I had have diminished. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"Loved It ♡♡♡♡♡ I LOVE this product! It made my skin look and feel amazing! I could see a visable difference in skin tone within about 7-10 days! Also loved that it is very mild, pleasant smelling. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Moisturizer Using this product for 3 weeks and I see the diference, I can feel when I have the moisturizer on my skin ,the skin feel soft, smooth, I really like it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"This Was My Favorite Moisturizer I have normal skin, but I was able to use this moisturizer morning and night! I love how although the suggested use was nighttime, it was light enough to use as a daytime moisturizer after applying the Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum. This product also replaced my primer. I use a stick foundation and this non-greasy moisturizer worked great and did not cause my make up to run. It also delivered results as the package stated it improved my skin texture and minimized fine lines after one week. It smelled nice and was not too heavy throughout the day. I live in Southern CA and the weather has been very warm lately, but I had no problems with this product even after sweating. I can use this product year round. I will purchase in the future.

"Couldn't Ask For More! I don't usually wear a lot of makeup because every time I have used a moisturizer, it makes my skin feel oily. And without a moisturizer, my skin is very dry. It's been very hard for me to find that perfect balance. I have finally found it in the RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. At first, was a little suspicious because it doesn't look or feel different form any other brand I've tried when first putting it on, but within an hour, I knew I had found my match! It perfectly moisturized my face without making me feel oily, and it lasted long enough to keep my feeling moisturized all day. It the perfect balance for me!

Luxurious And Soft This was super soft and smelled amazing. I used it for a week and thought my complex was softer already. Can't wait to continue using it. I wore this at night and it did not make my face hot at all! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Fresh Scent And Skin Feels Smooth, Soft, Yet Not Greasy Really loving all of the products but I would say this is my favorite! My face and wrinkles (LOL) are softer and less defined. It absorbs into the skin without feeling greasy! It has a clean fresh scent which a woman can appreciate! I definitely recommend L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Facial Moisturizer as you will see a more softer, not shiney look to your whole face!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Very Luxorious! The Loreal Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer is very luxorious. The cream itself is rich and velvety. After the first use, I found my skin was so much softer. I use this at night and my skin is so smooth I the morning. After continued use I notice my skin stays hydrated and it appears brighter. I will definitely continue using this product. I do wish it came without a scent, though. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Easily The Best Lotion I've Used. Love how light this feels! It doesn't leave a greasy feel like some lotions do. I use this morning and night now, and cannot imagine my daily routine without it. Smells great too! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love This! I really like the feel of this moisturizer. It almost feels like it dries instantly with a powder smooth feel. I love the scent as well. I've noticed that the bags under my eyes are gone and my crows feet have lightened. I have even received a compliment on my skin and I have only been using the moisturizer for a little over a week. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Really Like This Moisturizer! I use this cream in the morning as a daily moisturizer for three weeks and I really like it. I have slightly dry skin and am at the age where I am starting to see very fine lines that don't always go away after a good night's sleep. This moisturizer makes my skin look very smooth and dewy. The consistency is light and it goes on nicely. My skin almost seems to drink it in. A small amount gives very good coverage. It has a light cosmetic scent that is not overpowering. Once I apply it in the morning, it feels like it last most of the day unless I wash my face again. I wear light daily makeup and haven't noticed and problems with wearing this product underneath. I also like the packaging. It is attractive and looks nice on my dressing table. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"My Dry Skin Thanks You, L'oreal. This is a great moisturizer. I've used this product twice a day for the past 3 weeks along with L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Day Lotion Moisturizer (Broad Spectrum SPF 20). It has a very subtle, pleasant fragrance and I can already see and feel an improvement.

"My New Best Friend ❤ I think that the L'Oral Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer is nothing short of AMAZING! I live in Iowa with lots of weather changes..sun, wind and COLD! I have never had a facial moisturizer that doesnt feel like you have a mud pack on! This L'Oral Deep Acting Moisturizer is light and just disappears as you put it on. Not greasy and feels so good on your skin! I ride my motorcycle ALOT and windburn is a frequent issue, this has been the only thing that has helped! Not to mention I'm 40 and fine lines and wrinkles are starting to fade :) This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"I Love This Cream! I am honest in my Bzz reviews, and I'm going to be totally honest here: This is wonderful cream! It's smooth and non-greasy. I put it on before bed and I wake up with softer skin. I have very dry skin and many lotions and creams don't penetrate my skin or they feel greasy or heavy. This cream is light but powerful. I buy expensive face creams and this less expensive, easier-to-find cream is actually better than the expensive ones. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Wonderfully Smooth! After only 3 days of using this product, I'm seeing a dramatic improvement in my skin. It's gentle enough for my sensitive skin and leaves it soft and smoothe with no greasy residue or obnoxious scent. Very pleasant, light, and can't wait to see what one week, two weeks, and beyond, this product will bring to improving my skin! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love This Product I am so grateful to be added to this campaign for the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Acting FAcial Moisturizer. I used it for the first time last night and loved how it made my face feel. I can't wait to notice the difference after a week or so. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Perfect To Use Under Makeup L'Oral does it again. I'm obsessed with their skin products. Mainly their anti aging facial creams and serum. Revitalift Triple Power is awesome! It is so rich and luxurious and akin to high end skin care products. A little dab covers so much and leaves your face feeling very moisturized. I always feel like I have a youthful glow when I wear L'Oral facial moisturizers. I think I know why! If you open the container it looks like the standard cream colored cream. I rubbed a little bit on my hand and it dried down to a very subtle sheer iridescent color. The glow! It looks amazing under my foundation. That dewy, highlighted look is in now. Score that I'm following a trend and also fighting wrinkles! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer The moisturizer was so smooth when I put it on my face and neck and not greasy at all. I loved the feel of it on my skin. I have only used it for 3 days at night and in the morning before I put my make up on but already see a difference in my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Serum And Deep Acting Moisturizer I am just starting to try the loreal triple power products so I can only review the fragrance which is light and the immediate way it makes my skin feel. My skin felt very cool and dewy right after using. When I woke up in the morning it still felt very soft. I am really curious if my skin tone will improve or wrinkles will lessen over time. I will write again after a week and also three weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Just Received This I'm in my 40's and thought that I would never use anything to help take away my wrinkles but after having a grandchild I figured why not try something . I love the way it makes my face feel after applying it . I would recommend trying it . I'm sure you'll love it to. It's not greedy or anything like I had expected it to be.

"Great Used As A Night/day Cream I'm in LOVE! Not too many things excite me more than a great moisturizer! L'oreal Paris Triple Power DEEP-ACTING MOISTURIZER has done just that for me! I'm clearing out my vanity drawer of unusable, non effective, so called moisturuzers and keeping my vanity stocked with L'oreal Paris Triple Power DEEP-ACTING MOISTURIZER. I've used it for both day AND night moisturizing but, becausd of the rich creamy formula, I've decided to use it specifically for night. The formula is so rich and creamy, absorbs into my skin effortlessly and leaves my skin feeling richly hydrated and healthy! I'm an ingredient reader! Hands down, the boxes are always turned and rolled around until every word iz read. I did just that with this L'oreal Paris Triple Power DEEP-ACTING MOISTURUZER. The formula repairs wrinkles, re-firms skin, and redensify your skin. Thats everything my aging skin needs. This formula has hyaluronic acid which helps hydrate your skin to make your skin plump with moisture and help retain water under your skins layers preventing a dehydrated, dry look and feel. Also, this rich creamy formula contains PRO-XYLANE. L'oreal Paris laboratories developed this formula to help repair and fight the appearance of age spots accosiated with sun exposure. Harmful UVA/UVB rays. I cleanse my face and neck each night and apply a generous amount of L'oreal Paris Triple Power DEEP-ACTING MOISTURIZER. Applying a generous amount absorbs 100 into my skin. Making me feel like my skin will stay hydrated, nourished and stay healthy without me feeling like I'm wearing a mask. For this formula to be as thick and rich as it is, and not have a heavy feeling on my face during the night is a PLUS in my book. L'orealParis Triple Power DEEP-ACTING MOISTURIZER is another, I'M SO WORTH IT products that I can recommend this product to women of all ages and skin types. For young skin and maturing skin, you can use it for day and use it for night time moisturizing. L'oreal Paris has made this innovative lightweight formula perfect for using it day AND night. I used it for both day and night at first but, found I prefer using it as a night time moisturizer. You should buy it also because, YOU ARE WORTH IT Thank you L'orealParis for allowing me to try your L'oreal Paris Triple Power DEEP-ACTING MOIZTURIZER. I'm going to continue using this great products as its delivering results I am noticing. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"So Far So Good! I received my kit yesterday afternoon. After washing my face last night I put on the serum and moisturizer. Both had a very nice light fragrance. The serum applied very smooth. The moisturizer is very thick, so a little bit goes a long way. I don't like lotions or creams that feel heavy once I put them on, so thankfully this moisturizer didn't feel that way. My face felt soft and moisturized without the feel of my pores not being able to breath. This morning after showering, I put the day lotion on. Again, it had a nice fragrance. It have my face the moisture it needed without feeling too heavy. I also LOVE that it has added sun screen in it. I will update my review once I use it for at least a week, but as of now, I think I'm really going to like this set. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

This Is Something Wonderful! I was soooooo excited to get my kit in the mail yesterday I couldn't wait to go to bed to try it out! I can't say enough about this moisturizer.

"Wow, Super Moisturizing! I have used this product a few times, and it is very moisturizing, which is perfect for my combination skin. I have a tendency to get flaky on and around my nose, and this has completely cleared that up. It is a slightly heavy moisturizer, but does not feel greasy. I would highly recommend it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Very Moisturizing. I tried this for the first time last night after applying the Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum. This moisturizer has a nice creamy, but not too greasy texture. It absorbs pretty well into my skin, but I do still feel it there throughout the night. This isn't necessarily a bad quality. The only concern is the scent. It doesn't seem strong when applied, but I could continue to smell it for hours. This could be too much for those sensitive to fragrance. Since this cream is thicker than my usual Alba oil-free facial lotion, I am worried about break outs. If that doesn't end up being a problem with my acne prone skin, I would consider purchasing this product . My face continues feels soft and moisturized the morning after using this cream.

Christmas Came Early I think this set is AMAZING. I tried the deep moisturizer first and my face feels like a baby's bottom.

"Finally A Moisturizer That Works! Over the last few years, with the birth of my two children, my face has gone through many changes: combo to dry to oily to dry and back to oily. Oil free moisturizer left my skin dry and face creams made me feel like my makeup was going to slide off. The L'Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Day/Night is light without feeling too greasy. It absorbs well too. SO glad I had the opportunity to try it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

"You Can Feel It Working In Minutes!! So far On day one with in minutes of using both the L'Oral Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment and Triple Power deep acting moisturizer I am pretty impressed. First let me say a little dab of each goes a LONG way!!! Which is great because the product will last you a little bit, which being on a budget is amazing! Second it makes your face and neck incredibly soft, radiant and looking refreshed. And Last but not Least so far I could feel the skin around my eyes starting to lift and tighten. My only complaint I have is it took me a few minutes to figure out where the directions were, I wish they would have put them on the back of the boxes instead of the side! I can't wait to report back in a few days on how it is going! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Soft Smooth Skin I love this rich and thick moisturizer! It keeps my skin soft for 24 hours and it really helps in the cold dry wind to keep your face from getting flaky! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"I'm Truly Loving This! First let me start by saying that I'm pretty picky when it comes to moisturizers. For one thing, I have pretty sensitive skin, which limits what kinds of moisturizers I can use anyway. For another, I hate when a moisturizer is so thick that you have to use large amounts of it to cover your whole face. This L'Oreal Deep-Acting Moisturizer is not like that at all. Even with my sensitive skin I was able to use this moisturizer with no issues whatsoever. And trust me when I say that a little bit goes a long way! When I first used it I used too much, and as a result my skin was left kind of oily. However, during subsequent uses I made sure to use much less, and it was perfect. No oily skin but perfectly soft skin instead. It truly feels amazing going on, and the scent, while still subtle, is very nice and pleasant. My regular moisturizer has no scent to it, and I'm surprised to say that I actually prefer this moisturizer to my regular one, which I've been using for 15 years. Best of all, this moisturizer is actually cheaper! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Awesome Doesn't Even Begin To Cover It!! I think this product far surpasses its claims! I could see results literally within days! L'Oreal definitely hit it out of the ballpark with this anti-aging line! I love it and will definitely recommend it to everybody!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
My Moisturizer Adventure! I think I really love this product! This product is the type of product where a little goes a long way. The product I thought smelled really good and fresh. I haven't tried a lot of different moisturizer and was hesitant because I struggle with oily skin and acne however after using this product for 4 days my skin is not oily but smooth and soft!. I'm definitely going to continue using this and am happy to say it will be awhile before I run out! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Smells Lovely. I don't use a lot of different facial products as their strong perfumy odour bothers me. This skin care regimen has a soft subtle scent that enhances it's use. There was excellent hydration noticable after using just 3 days. I not only used it on my face, but on my forearms so I could actually see the improvement without looking in a mirror. It reduced the crepiness and made my skin taught and younger looking. I will be buying this product in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Skin So Smooth I love the revitalif triple power deep acting moisturizer. My skin feels so smooth and refreshed. I use it once in the morning and once before bed. It's a must do everyday now This review was collected as part of a promotion.

"L'oreal Paris Is Amazingly I am an African American Middle Age women with very oily skin, just recently I start trying a product that my dermatologist prescribed for oily skin and acne prone skin. This new medication left my skin very dry and I have tried multiple moisturizers to help relieve the dryness. The majority of them, I tried left my skin Feeling or Oily all over. Until I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Moisturizer. This moisturizer left my skin feeling clean smooth. My skin didn't appear to be full of greasers or oil. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who is using acne medication-and need to keep their skin hydrated. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Great Hair Gel This is the best hair gel I have used. I especially like that it is clear and leaves no trace of color like so many other gels often do.
Amazing Results I will be 65 tomorrow and my face had begun to sag at my jawline. I've been using Revitalift Triple Power serum and Triple Power Deep Action Moisturizer cream for 4 days and I can testify these L'Oreal products work. My jawline is already tighter and the sag is clearly diminished. I am amazed. Did not really expect much of a difference. I'm trying the eye cream next. These are inexpensive and worth every penny. You won't be disappointed.

"What More Can A Girl Ask For! I'm 49 years old and have lived in the Deep South my entire life. I've always had combination skin with dry patches. RevitaLift Triple Power is WONDERFUL! No more dry patches, no problems with it being to oily, the soft fragrence is a very nice plus! Firmer, smoother, clearer skin, what more can a girl (okay, grown girl) ask for"
Lightweight And Moisturzing Love this moisturizer! It is lightweight and does not leave my skin feeling greasy! Smells clean and very light
"Great Moisturizer I love this moisturizer,i didnt break out in acne.It has a great scent plus when you apply it leaves your skin feeling very soft and silky and its not greasy at all ,a little dab goes a long way. Great product."
"Love It! But If You Have Oily Skin... I love this moisturizer, it's rich and a little dab goes a long way. On my first week it helped with my acne ( as long as I washed my face twice a day and applied the moisturizer) but eventually my skin started to get too oily, so I used it only at night still getting great results. I'm 28, so wrinkles are not much of a problem to me right now but I did see a big improvment on my skin. I would def. recommend this moisturizer but if you have oily skin or combination like mine, go easy with it."
Great Moisturizer I was happy with the results of this moisturizer. It has a great clean scent and my face felt a lot softer and a little tighter.
Love This Moisturizer This moisturizer really does its job. your skin feels very silky and smooth and you can tell it lasts for a long time on your face.
"Got Rid Of Neck Wrinkles!! I was a little sceptical at first, but after using it twice those little wrinkles on my throat under my chin are gone! So exciting! I've tried several other moisturizers, but none got rid of these wrinkles! I love how it feels going on"
Triple Power The best moisturizer I ever had leaves my skin soft looking hydrated and younger looking!! I have gotten so many compliments on my skin. THANK YOU L'OREAL TRIPLE POWER...deep acting moisturizer!!!!
love it firm hold without dandruff
I Love This Product! This is a great moisturizer. Not at all greasy and helps with the fine lines. I use it twice a day and love it!
"People Have Already Said I Look Younger! at first, i wondered if this was jus going to be another moisturizer. i was surprised! i followed directions. went on smooth, not greasy. really seems to enhance my skin more than any other product i've tried. i have cancer (so prob cant afford to buy more ( )"
"Revitalift Triple Power Moisturizer - Loved It I received this moisturizer at the perfect time. I was on the hunt for a new product. I couldn't be happier with ifinding it in my mailbox. It is thick to the touch, glides on beautifully and most noticebaly my skin feels so much softer as well as looking smoother and younger. It has a nice light scent and I've found that a little bit really does go a long way."
Great Moisturizer This cream is very lightweight. Love to use it morning and night. Can also use before foundation. Not heavy at all.
"Triple Power Is Powerful Stuff! I've been using L'Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer twice a day for a few weeks now, and I highly recommend it! It's very thick and rich. It has a light, pleasant scent and is easy to apply. the cream absorbs quickly into the skin leaving it feeling silky smooth! The best part... It erases fine lines as if they were never there!"
Good Effects i loved this product it covered up my tired eyes
My Skin Feels Great! I am always weary of anti-aging moisurizers. This one is exceptional! I saw smoother more hydrated skin in the first 2 days. I also didn't have any kind of breakout as a result. That is usually why I don't use a moisturizer. Also it has a great price retail!!
Works Great It helps with the wrinles and it makes my skin feel smooth
A Lot Of Moisture Have used other products with no real difference. This seems to alow my skin to retain the moisture better.
"Lots Of Moisture As soon as I applied it to my face, I noticed how creamy it was and sliky. What really made me know that it was working, was the fact when i washed my face the next morning, I felt my face feeling different when I applied my face soap it felt like I just moisturized it, I swear my skin felt so moist. I LOVE IT."
"Good base product, hold factor is almost neglible, dry to light wet finish One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No Baxter's Cream Pomade claims to be a light hold/soft finish product. It really doesn't feel like a pomade at all. To me, it's just a thick cream that probably could have been put in a squeeze tube.For me, I find the best way to use hair products is to layer them. So I would 1) work in this soft creme, or a comparable workable pomade 2) add a thickening agent like a hard creme and 3) finish with something that gives a firm hold.Also, not a huge believer in the less is more rule when it comes to hair products. I prefer a good finger full evenly worked throughout. Same for this product. I mean I don't goop it on, but using a dime-size isn't enough.Since all hair is different and the styles desired by people too, hair products can be very subjective in how they are rated. That caveat aside, if your hair is short and you do use product, then I'd bet this soft cream could find a home in your hair product selection. It will put your hair into a workable, flexible mode that is ready for shaping in any way you want. I wouldn't use it on it's own because the hold factor isn't there for the style I wear. It just makes the hair maneuverable enough to style the way I want, and then I use something else to lock that style in place. If you were going for a natural comb to one side look, this might be all you need thought. As a closing note, the glass jar this stuff comes in is really cool. Price is a bit high, but it is good stuff.I would use the product again."
"Wrinkles Are Less Noticeable. I received Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer a couple of weeks ago. I was skeptical, but after using this twice daily, I can definately tell a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes, forehead, and around my lips. In my mid-fifties, I have been looking for something to make my wrinkles less noticeable, and this product has sure done the trick."
"Exceptional Moisturizer In the winter, My skin on my face is so dry and cracked. Using make up everyday only makes the situation worse. My face is so tight and itchy during the winter, It's just down right uncomfortable. Since I recieved the RevitaLift, my skin is less irratated. It feels normal and doesn't look dry at all. In fact I went skiing today with my face exposed all day and it felt smooth and fresh, not dry"
Revivalift Revivalift works wells makes my skin very soft and seem very tone.
Loved This Product I really loved the Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer. I loved the smell
"Smooth And Silky! I have been using it for two weeks. I really like how my skin feels. I also notice that it seems to be minimizing my wrinkles somewhat. The fragrance is nice, and not overpowering like some other brands. It's not greasy and soaks in nicely. Now that I have tried it for free, I plan on purchasing it when I run out of it. Thank you for the opportunity to try it! I am very pleased with your product! I highly recommend it!"
Love This Moisturizer I received this moisturizer and have loved it. It goes on nice and makes my fine lines dissappear. My face is very smooth and soft. The moisturizer seems to stay on all day.
"Love It And Omg Thank You!!!!!! I wasas shocked to receive a huge beautiful jar of revitalift in the mail shortly after new years day 1/2/13. I was out of all my products. I love anything L'oreal makes and also, only use their paris hair dye. This product is thick enough you only need a lil each use, I am 47, 48 in april :( , lol and have no wrinlke's. It's a mystery who sent me this huge beautiful jar, but thank you for awesome products of every kind."
Makes My Skin Soft And Smooth Makes my fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes less noticable soft and light on my skin not greasy or heavy excellent product makes me feel young again!
"Revitalift Triple Power oh my goodness this is a wonderful product, been using about two weeks and i can really see the differance in my lines, skin and dryness."
Finally I LOVE this-what more can words say. I finally found something that actually works as it says it will.
"Not bad Was never a fan of pomade--never really knew how to make it work and still look good on me. I read about this product in an on-line article and thought what the heck, try it. It has not been a bad product. I like it better than other pomades I have purchased in the past from salons."
Makes My Skin Feel Hydrated All Day Before I started using the RevitaLift Triple Power Moisturizer my make up started to crumble on my cheeks and look greasy on my t-zone after a while. Now my face seems to be more evenend out and it seems to retain the moisture in my skin.
"Best Moisturizer I Ever Used, Compares The Best! I really love the thick, and creamy moisturizer! I used many other including olay! I believe I was won over buy this cream! I will buy it and recommend it to my friends! Thank you Loreal! Your team is genious!!"
The Best Deep-acting Moisturizer! I use this product morning and nite. You only need a small amount and it makes you feel like you have done something very important for your skin. I have been using just over a month and I do see a visible differnce in my skin's texture and appearance.
"Love Revitalift - Am Seeing The Difference!! I have been using for about 3 weeks. My face is healthier and less dry, and wrinkles are definitely fading. I use it at night after cleaning and when I wake up, my face feels wonderful. Especially during the cold months, when my skin is especially dry. My makeup goes on so smoothly now, and I am now having acne breakouts either. This moisturizer is working great with my skin! I love it!!!"
"Love It I loved this moisturizer. It is thick, goes on nicely, smells good. I love how smooth my face feels!"
"Feels Great! Smooth skin, less wrinkles!"
"Long-lasting! Great For Dry Skin! You can feel the difference after first application. My skin feels silky soft and hydrated. I use it in the morning before putting my make-up on and the effect can last the whole day. You only need a thin coat otherwise it will tend to clump when combined with foundation or other products. I still love it though and plan of using it as part of my daily skincare routine for a long period of time. I also use it at night as part of my skincare routine. So far, one of the best moisturizers."
"I Love This Stuff! I've been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks now, and I love it! Within the first few days my skin looked more youthful. I have combination skin, and my face feels so soft but not greasy."
"Moisturizing Dream This product truely does a great job on my skin! It's a great moisturizer and keeps my skin soft all day, even on those days when I work out in the cold wind."
"L'oreal Paris Triple Power Moisturizer Triple Fab WOW!!! Really pleased with the NEW L'OREAL PARIS Triple Action, Triple Results, Triple Power deep-acting moisturizer. The lines around my mouth have smoothed out and the skin is more supple. The scent is lovely! Thank you for this fabulous product and will continue to purchase this in the future.."
"Nice and clean One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No Baxter's Cream Pomade is a nice, clean hair product that incorporates well on your strands and keeps things looking soft and natural through the course of a day. I have short-medium mens hair and I prefer to keep my style looking clean-cut, masculine and unfussy and this product manages to keep things in line by providing some added volume and a subtle, moisturized finish.The compact 2 ounce jar is handy when traveling and since a small dab is all I need I expect it to last at least 3 months with near daily use. The cream gets kudos for those who like to keep things low maintenance as it easily applies to your hair, washes out with no hassle and has no perfumed scent worth mention."
Eliminating Peri Menoposal Dry Patches Before I began using RevitaLift Triple Power I was experiencing dry patches around my mouth for the first time in my life. This product has been a great addition to my beauty routine and I recomend it to anyone with maturing skin.
Love This! My skin is definitely way better than before I used it..lots of moisture and lines are smaller
"It Does Lift Your Skin I really didn't expect much, but I was really very pleasantly surprised. I used some on my eyelids, and they tightened up and lifted making me look younger. Thanks. Can't afford plastic surgery, and I'm so glad to find this works for me. No irritation of the skin either."
Great Moisturizer really made a difference in my skin
Great Product Helped with the dryness and added lots of moisture to my face and neck.
Works As Advertised! This product definitely lives up to its promise. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. My skin felt smoother and I also liked that the scent was mild.
"Delivers All Day Moisture From morning till evening this moisturizer delivers long lasting results. With daily use, I have found my skin to be softer and the fine lines have decreased."
"Love The Feel Of This its not greasy , skin absorbes this very fast, and leaves my skin feeling better then it ever has"
Max Moisture! I loved everything abour the Revitalift Triple Power. My skin was hydrated - it smells wonderful and I noticed in the 5 days that sun spots were lightening up!
Wonderful! Received a jar in the mail from Loreal and I absolutely love it! My skin has never been so soft. I don't think I've ever had winter skin this moisturized!
"Great for Taming Longish Hair I started growing out my hair a couple months ago. BoC Clay Pomade used to be my go-to product, but it was making my hair a bit too stiff as it got longer. I tried this cream as a substitute, and it's just what I needed."
Love This Product Very moisturizing. Helped with wrinkles near mouth.
Youth Fountain In A Bottle I just love this product it not only makes my face and neck soft younger looking but one day I had a little more product on my fingers than I needed and didnt want to waste it so I rubbed it onto the top of my hands and wow my hands look fantastic and feeel soft
Excellent! Immediately improved the look of my skin
"revitalift triple power oh my goodness this is a wonderful product, been using about two weeks and i can really see the differance in my lines, skin and dryness."

Makes my skin soft and smooth Makes my fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes less noticable; soft and light on my skin; not greasy or heavy; excellent product; makes me feel young again!
TRIPLE POWER The best moisturizer I ever had leaves my skin soft looking hydrated and younger looking!! I have gotten so many compliments on my skin.THANK YOU L'OREAL TRIPLE POWER...deep acting moisturizer!!!!

"Great hold, leaves little residue One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No Switched from Malin + Goetz's styling cream. This has more hold, and doesn't leave much residue. Keeps my hair in it's styled position, and leaves it soft. If you want a solid product that has a firm hold, but doesn't leave your hair all sticky and gross, this is the one you need. I couldn't recommend it highly enough."
Amazing results I will be 65 tomorrow and my face had begun to sag at my jawline. I've been using Revitalift Triple Power serum and Triple Power Deep Action Moisturizer cream for 4 days and I can testify these L'Oreal products work. My jawline is already tighter and the sag is clearly diminished. I am amazed. Did not really expect much of a difference. I'm trying the eye cream next. These are inexpensive and worth every penny. You won't be disappointed.
"What more can a girl ask for! I'm 49 years old and have lived in the Deep South my entire life. I've always had combination skin with dry patches. RevitaLift Triple Power is WONDERFUL! No more dry patches, no problems with it being to oily, the soft fragrence is a very nice plus! Firmer, smoother, clearer skin, what more can a girl (okay, grown girl) ask for?"

FINALLY I LOVE this-what more can words say. I finally found something that actually works as it says it will.
"Light holding power that leaves my hair soft to touch and not greasy at all I've tried many products to control my hair and many are just terrible... either too greasy, too shiny, too thick or too much fragrance or some combination of these. I had the opportunity to try this Baxter of California Cream Pomade and this may be one hair product that I'll actually use again.It's a very lightweight cream with a consistency similar to a hand cream. Previously I had been using MenScience Hair Styling Pomade (2 oz.) and it is very hard in the container... nearly like hardened wax. It's somewhat of a chore to use it because you literally have to scoop out a dab of it and let it warm up in your hands before you can put it into your hair.This pomade is very creamy and infinitely easier to scoop out and apply than the MenScience Pomade. Although the Baxter of California Pomade is not fragrance free, the amount of fragrance is very minimal and barely discernible.It's a lightweight holding power that lets my curls curl and at the same time leaves my hair soft. It may not provide enough hold for some hair types but for my hair, it works great."
nan
"Love it! but if you have oily skin... I love this moisturizer, it's rich and a little dab goes a long way. On my first week it helped with my acne ( as long as I washed my face twice a day and applied the moisturizer) but eventually my skin started to get too oily, so I used it only at night still getting great results. I'm 28, so wrinkles are not much of a problem to me right now but I did see a big improvment on my skin.I would def. recommend this moisturizer but if you have oily skin or combination like mine, go easy with it."

"This Stuff Is Amazing!! I used this moisturizer along with the serum and SPF 20 daily face lotion and I have to say this this deep-acting moisturizer is fantastic!! I've been using the product every morning and evening for a week now and I have to say that I can already see the difference in my skin. This moisturizer is so thick yet when I apply it, it feels very light weight. When they say this moisturizer is deep-acting, they mean it. My skin has never been softer and smoother!! The scent is also very nice!! My skin looks amazing...soft, smooth, glowing, fine lines are fading. I can't wait to see my results after 4 weeks. This product is a game changer!!! Highly recommend! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
New Formula I just tried a new bottle of Suave Ocean Breeze Body Wash and noticed a lot of floating white soap scum in my bath. I use this product BECAUSE it didn't leave a scummy residue in the water. I looked at the empty bottle I'd just thrown away and noticed the old bottle said Suave Naturals and the new bottle was labeled Suave Essentials. I much prefer the Naturals formula. Will you still make it because I hate this new stuff.
Ambi Skincare It makes my face feel nice and fresh. After about 3 days i did get slight acne but it cleared right back up! Will deff use this every day from now on!
Nice Feels amazing made my skin feel great and not dry anymore .
"Wonderful Pomade! One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No I have been using this for a month now and I love it! I have short fly away hair and this pomade has just enough hold to keep my aid in place during the day without making my hair look greasy or like it has a lot of product in it. The smell is also wonderful! My wife, who also has short hair, has been using it as well and she loves it and how the smell is there, but not overpowering like many of the products out there.This is a great pomade and wonderful for some light hold styling!"
Good Good stuff
Satisfied Really like the way this product lathers! Love it!
Use to love this product I fell in love with this product in 2015 when I purchased it In Las Vegas. Once I got home in North Carolina I see they have a new look and the fragrance is not the same. Need to go back to the way it was before.
"Great for hair too! Although I bought this as a body wash, I tried it on my hair. I desperately wanted a super-clean feel, since all shampoos seem to leave gunk on my hair. WOW. This is great! It is a little drying because obviously, there are no conditioners added but I live in Vegas--I need to feel clean after being in 100+ temperatures. I love the fragrance too earthy, crisp, and really light. If you want to clarify hair or just be incredibly clean, this is for you."
Ocean Breeze Body Wash Love this product! Lathers well. Cleans gently. smells great
"Wonderful product I love everything about this product. The scent, the color, the way it cleans and the price. I used to spend a LOT of money on shower gels at one of those speciality stores but no more. This leaves you feeling clean and energized and the scent lingers lightly on your skin."
use it all the time My sons like this kind of body wash and the price is perfect.
"Great clean feeling and fragrance. Cleans great, smells great and does not break your bank account."
"the best This is the best body wash I have used ever, I. have spend thousands of dollars over the years hands down the best"
Smells Great I like the smell of this product. Like how it lathers up and washes off. Just the right size. I would buy this again
"Great for a natural look and natural hold great product. i've tried a few other pomades, but prefer Baxter cream pomade as my go-to everyday one. I find it gives off a more natural look (not the pomade to get if you want a slickback) and a natural hold.For a greasy look, i usually use Anchors Teddy Boy original."
"Body Wash I very much like the scent, which I have to be careful of because of sinus problems. The price was very economical."
Suave Essentials Ocean Breeze Body Wash Very great product...cleans smell great and price is right
Best ocean scent I have ever smelled Love love love the scent...need a body spray to go with it for scent layering!!!
Great I love the smell how it gets u so clean
"So FRESH This Body Wash has such a soft, fresh scent. I feel totally refreshed after showering with it. My Husband even comments on how nice is smells!"
"Clean Feel This product just makes me smile every time I use it. The aroma itself just makes you want to smile. The way I feel after I use it is an indescribable feeling, clean this product is insane go get it NOW This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Reminds me of my childhood I really love this body wash especially because i love ocean fragrances and would get them in just about anything and this stuff definitely reminds me of when i was first introduced to ocean fragrances when i was about 8 or 9 and this stuff makes me feel clean and fresh.
"Missing our suave! love suave naturals shampoo, only trouble is, I'm in Canada and also wheelchair bound, cannot drive and cannot get my favourite shampoo. Please unilever. Please bring Suave back to Canada... thank you a family who uses it daily.."
"Beautiful Smell! I was definitely expectant of a great smell. I was still blown away by the scent it left on me. My skin felt clean but not dried out. Lathered well, and was a piece of cake to apply. My only complaint is that I wish there was more!"
Great Scent I love this scent and have used it several times. I love the invigorating and eye-opening scent in the morning and at night. It leaves the skin feeling clean and fresh not feeling residue like other competitors.
"Great cream! Love this product as it is not greasy and heavy feeling. The brown bottles seem to have a better scent than the white, waterproof bottles. For me, still the best product."
Relaxing The smell gives you a refreshing and relaxing feeling after any strenuous day you might have had. It also could be the way to start off a great day feeling of joy!!
"MADE IN THE USA First off, it's made in the USA and I support that. It also smells great, is hypoallergenic, and has a low and reasonable pricetag. Thanks Suave."
Great for sensitive skin! Having sensitive skin means not a lot of variety to choose from. suave products are fantastic and don't break me out!!
Smells Great!!!! Great lather and smells so Good!!! Enjoy using the different variety that you carry! This is one of my favorite!!!
smells great. Suave definetly is the only body wash I will spend my money on for my family.. Thank you for a great product.
Smell and feel The bottom line is that this stuff not only works great I love the scent afterwords.
"Great body wash!! I buy it all the time ,love the body wash,and it smell wonderful!!"
I love suave! Suave is the only body wash I buy. It is inexpensive and smells wonderful.
"It cleans my hair well. It's a fine shampoo for a good price, and it smells nice."
Love The Products Love Them Definatley will keep using All The Products
"Wonderful I've looked and looked, so glad I finally found this product, it is awesome."

Bring back shea butter version!!! old version is better than the new version.........
Bring back shea butter version!!! Me and my husband used the shea butter version for years and loved it. Our hands were moisturized and eczema free. Not so with the new version. Neither one of us can use this.
Complete downgrade! This used to be the moisturizing cream with shea butter which was superb. Now the shea butter has been replaced with meadowfoam oil and it is absolutely horrible. Why do I need meadowfoam oil on my skin Does that even work These days they are just putting any kind of oil in any cream to cut corners and save money. But nothing moisturizes as good as Shea Butter :(
"Bring back the original version! The original product was amazing, this new one is not even comparable! I've searched high and low and have ordered what shows a BLUE cap and SHEA BUTTER, only to get this new Meadowfoam Oil version. Such a waste of money, shipping and time. Whay change a great product"
Why mess with success I bought the new meadowfoam oil moisturizer and it is thin and extremely greasy. Not a fan. Why would they get rid of the moisturizer with Shea butter On the hunt for the old kind...
Why did you change the shea butter version I do not like the new version. It is too greasy and oily. Bring back the old version!!
"Cetaphil therapeutic hand cream Very disappointed with reformulation of product. Shea butter version outstanding. Meadowfoam oil version is greasy. Too bad, finding another product"

Old Product Was Better Please bring back the shea butter blue cap product. The ingredients in the replacement are not nearly as nourishing.
Disappointed! I love the old version with shea butter. The new formulation isn't near as good as the old version. Please pay attention to these reviews Cetaphil. Bring back the old product.

Disappointed! I love the old version with shea butter. The new formulation isn't near as good as the old version. Please pay attention to these reviews Cetaphil. Bring back the old product.
Not The Same Product As Previous Reviews I was hoping they would improve upon the previous formula which I loved but was a little thick. It was made with Shea Butter. This is a new formula and packaging with the same old SKU number. It is thinner and oilyer more like a body lotion not good for hands at all. Way overpriced and a disappointment. Any review prior to mine pertain to the old formula and should be disregarded.
"Very Effective, But Not Big Enough I was lucky enough to receive a free sample of this product in order to review it in return. I am a person with very fair and dry skin so I am constantly trying to find a product that will provide continually long lasting moisture to my skin. PROS: When it says intensive moisturizing cream it is not lying! After just three days of applying the lotion to my feet, cracks and roughness were almost completely eliminated. I also found it was great for applying to my legs right after I shaved as it left them feeling soft and smooth for hours at a time. CONS: The main issue I have with the lotion is the size. While it would be a good travel size, I want one that can also be kept at home for everyday use. Unfortunately there does not seem to be a larger size offered for the intensive moisturizing line, which I found to be very disappointing. PRICE: I found the price to be a little more then I would want to pay for only a 3oz bottle of lotion. Especially because it is a product that I would like to use on a daily basis, which would mean I would need to purchase a new one almost once a week. However, considering it's effectiveness, and the prices of similar products it is not too unreasonable. Overall I really enjoyed using the product but would be much more willingly to recommend it to others if it were either offered in larger quantities, or offered at a slightly lowered price"
love the feel and smell I use this product all season long. Keeps my skin moistured This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Not Very Moisturizing Not nearly as thick or moisturizing as expected. Save your money and get the cream in the tub instead.

"Moisturizing Cream I received a free sample of Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream. I really enjoyed this cream because I have dry skin along with a sensitivity to fragrance lotions and creams. This cream is fragrance free and is designed to moisturize the driest parts of the skin. For me I used the cream for my dry hands and elbows. The cream was gentle on my skin and over a weeks time I could notice the cream working for my skin. I do recommend this product to those who need a good moisturizing cream. However, the cream states that it is not greasy does leave the applied skin feeling greasy for awhile afterwards."
"The scent I love the face cleanser and the scent!! My problem is, none of your moisturizers or creams have a scent at all. I really wish all of your products would have the same fresh scent."
good cost i bought this a year ago and it works so good for my skin. im totally in love.
works great! I bought this a few weeks ago and it worked after just a few days and I work with my hands in harsh chemicals and my hands often hurt nothing ever really works that well that fast so I give thums up

"Moisturizes skin helps it rebuild itself. I have bad eczema on my knuckles, wrists, and the backs of my hands. My dermatologist gave me a strong topical steroid for it. The steroid tends to reduce the inflammation, but leaves my skin fragile and brittle so it gets broken and damaged again extremely easily, which tends to bring on another eczema outbreak. I can't use a lot of creams, even the ones that say they're for eczema because even they irritated my skin, especially any broken places. I started using this cream in addition to the steroid, and my skin started healing better and feels thicker, stronger, and more elastic, the way normal skin should. I like the combination of the heavier moisurizers, like glycerin and petrolatum, along with the lighter meadowfoam oil. It gives the cream a nice consistency, not too heavy and not too light. The moisture barrier lasts a long time, but it doesn't feel heavy or greasy. I will keep buying this for sure."
"I like it! Updated review. Initially I was very, very disappointed that this was not last years version with shea butter that I loved. However, once I tried the new version with Meadowfoam oil cream I loved it even more than the shea butter version. I use it as a hand and body moisturizer (after shower) in the winter months. I felt the consistency was better and easily absorbed into the skin. It did not leave a greasy residue. I love it! Give it a try. I am sure you will Love it too. It is perfect for dry and Sensitive skin."
"Love this product!! A friend recommended Austrailian Gold to me 4 years ago because my other lotion was causing rashes. No rashes with AG, and I will never use another tan lotion product."
"Excellent! LOVE this product. SO glad Cetaphil is producing lotions now without parabens and an overall higher quality, much more natural product that match EU standards. I will keep buying!!!"
"Best ever hand cream! I have a serious problem with cracked hands and cuticles that intensifies in winter. I have to wash my hands 10+ times daily. I am also allergic to many fragrances. This cream is the best thing I've ever found to help. It's not greasy, so I can go on with work immediately after applying. THANKS"
Great Product! I received this product as a free sample. I have very dry skin and have had poor luck with other creams. I recently gave birth and a side effect was even more dry skin on my hands. Within three application of this cream I noticed a difference and have continued to use it. It works wonderfully. Not greasy at all but you can feel it on your skin. I highly recommend this product. I will be getting one for the diaper bag and my purse!
"Fantastic Moisturizing Cream I received a free sample of Cetaphil Intensive Moisturizing Cream to review. Having used other Cetaphil products in the past, I was happy to give this cream a shot. I am happy with the results of using it. My hands are extremely dry - they crack and bleed at times. I have tried many other creams/lotions and could not seem to find one that worked well. This one does! I keep it by my bathroom sink and try to put it on several times throughout the day. I have noticed my dry hands have improved. I will continue to use this product even after this sample one is empty."
New Favorite Moisturizing Cream This product is my new holy grail moisturizer! It feels so nice on the skin and leaves my skin feeling moisturized throughout the day. It also has a pleasant scent that is good for both men and woman. My boyfriend is also a huge fan of this lotion because his hands always get really tough and dry and this works perfectly!
"Moisturizing Cream I received a free sample of this moisturizing cream and I LOVE it! It works really well on dry skin. I wear sandals daily and my feet are really dry, so I used this product on my feet every night before bed and I can say that my feet are so much softer now. This cream doesn't leave you feeling oily. The scent of the cream is very very mild, which I really like. I also liked that the lotion was in a tube form. I plan on purchasing another tube to keep it in my purse/diaper bag. I absolutely love cetaphil products because they are made for sensitive skin. I have recently begun using this product on my hands every morning and my hands are very soft! This was a great product and I would recommend you to purchase it!"
"Great Moisturizing Cream, Especially For Extremely Dry Skin This cream is fantastic! I have very dry skin, and I have two children with eczema. So finding a good quality moisturizer is very important here! I am very impressed at how well it moisturizes my skin and my girls'. It keeps our skin feeling hydrated for a long time, too. I was unsure about the size of the tube since we go through so much lotion here, but since it is an intense cream a little does go a long way. I would buy a bigger size, if it was available. With our extrememly dry skin, on top of other sensitive skin issues, we have been recommended Cetaphil brand products by my dermatologist and our pediatrician. So I trust the brand. I did recieve this product as a sample to try in exchange for a review, however I can say with all honesty that I am very impressed and will be purchansing this regularly in the future."
"Great Cream Without The Greasy Residue! I received a free sample of the Cetaphil Intensive Moisturizing Cream to review. I have a toddler, am a bit of a germophobe, and wash my hands on a consistent basis, so my hands can get very dry (especially in the winter). The cream is scent free and has a nice consistency - not too thick, so it can be used on elbows, knees, feet, etc. The cream contains shea butter which is super moisturizing, but doesnt leave a greasy residue. Love that Cetaphil has made a lotion with shea butter!"
"Moisturizes Skin & Helps It Rebuild Itself. I have bad eczema on my knuckles, wrists, and the backs of my hands. My dermatologist gave me a strong topical steroid for it. The steroid tends to reduce the inflammation, but leaves my skin fragile and brittle so it gets broken and damaged again extremely easily, which tends to bring on another eczema outbreak. I can't use a lot of creams, even the ones that say they're for eczema because even they irritated my skin, especially any broken places.

I love the smell! I have used this for years but can't find the SPF 4 on the shelves unless it has bronzer in it. The bronzer is messy and stains. This one doesn't make a mess or stain.
"Best Ever Hand Cream! I have a serious problem with cracked hands and cuticles that intensifies in winter. I have to wash my hands 10+ times daily. I am also allergic to many fragrances. This cream is the best thing I've ever found to help. It's not greasy, so I can go on with work immediately after applying. THANKS"
Wonderphil one of the best lotions I have ever used. Will definitely be buying again.
Please Bring Back The Shea Butter Version. Please bring back the shea butter version. It had a New label on it. New one with oil is greasy and not as effective.
"Best Moisturizing Cream Wish this was available in stores. I have never found a better cream for my hands. I live in Arizona and the air is very, very dry and my hands were just awful. Since using this they are much better. I have previously purchased many other products, but this is the best and it isn't greasy!"

"Very heavily fragranced I bought this last week to use on my infant son and have to return it due to the very heavy fragrance - a major irritant for sensitive skin/eczema. I am disappointed as the other ingredients sounded promising, but nothing that is marketed for use for babies or eczema should be so scented. I dabbed just a bit on my own hands (where I have eczema breakouts) and it stung, was very greasy, and the smell clung for hours afterwards even after washing/wiping off. Would not recommend. I cannot comment on the quality or effectiveness as we will not be using it."
Love it!!! I have been using this lotion for several years. So glad I can buy it online as it is not in stores.
"Grain-lik particles take forever to rub in Is this product suppose to have a grainy texture It takes forever to rub in. Other shea products are not this way. Is this normal I would have inquired through email rather than a review, but there is not Contact Us on the site."
Made it worse I'm 22 years old with eczema so I thought for sure a butter made for babies should be good for me. My first impression was that it was the perfect texture with a pleasant scent. But after multiple uses I'm sure this product is making my skin worse. Currently writing this review at 3 in the morning because I'm up itching after using this butter. Please don't use if you/your child has extremely sensitive skin. I know in theory Chamomile should help soothe the skin but I must be allergic to something in this product. Keep in mind I've used plain raw Shea butter before and didn't have this problem.
"A little disappointed I love Sheamoisture products, but this new formula is something I'm very disappointed with! The color is different, the smells off and I wondering if it still has the same healing properties! Every time I fall in love with a product, you all up n change something about it."
Texture not for me I used numerous Shea Moisture hair and skin care products so when I saw the eczema line I thought I'd try it. The consistency was too gritty and I didn't feel it helped much to continue using it after a few weeks.
Sandy texture I bought this for my little boys dry skin and the texture is like a sugar scrub. I can't get it all to melt into their skin. We live in MN and I'm wondering if the lotion froze in transport. I'm going to try warming it up next time.
"product is not uniformly mixed I think it is inherently a great product with quality ingredients, but the container arrived to me in a state ... hmm .... kinda like previously melted chocolate ... you know, how it it gets that white stuff that separates out and makes it seem not as good as it might've been before it got over-heated? Yeah .... that .... :("
great product smells great and is a moisturizing agent. it's helping with baby's cradle cap on her forehead. however it's NOT helping the eczema on my toddler. at all. :'(
Changed a bit Loved the first purchase- this one was gritty but still worked.

"Won't give up My grandson is 3 and was born with Ezema..bad around his mouth. This product works wonders however I purchased 3 more to have at every location for him and can't use them on his mouth due to it being chunky . I tried anyhow and just too greasy around his Lil mouth. This is the only product he will let you use . I still have some from the first container and will use the other 3 on myself. Love tis product , what keeps happening concerned"
Face Lotion SPF4 I Love this product cannot find it anywhere so I decided to go directly to the website.. It was delivered in a timely fashion as well.. I'm very happy!
nan
Like it.. Have been using and tried every type of eczema product for my DS and not as effective as i would like.. but this product loved it.. him being a boy he doesnt often let me moisturize his skin daily.. this helped.. started about everyday.. then every other and now twice a week.. no more rough patches.. itchiness and he loves putting it on himself.. fragrance a bit strong..
Good for eczema It's doesn't cure eczema (because there is no cure) but it's one of the few things that doesn't sting my daughter's moderate eczema. We go through about one container a week as we use it twice daily all over. She actually loves the grainy texture because it 'scratches' her itchy skin as I'm applying it.
"Love it! This, in combination with the Eczema Therapy soap bar, has improved my psoriasis and keratosis pillaris. It smells delightful! However, it is rather greasy in texture. This doesn't bother me, as I put it on before bed, and it moisturizes my sensitive skin very well!"
"Only thing that's has worked! After going to at least 5 dermatologists, trying every cream/lotion recommended (usually petroleum based) and submitting my 3 yr old to several different strengths of topical steroids for over a year I've finally found something that works! It hasn't cured him but has improved his condition drastically. We apply it in the morning before dressing, in the evening before bed and under those heavy footed pjs (really keeps the moisture in). I always keep his nails trimmed to prevent the scratching. For his condition its key to keep him moisturizer at all times so we sometimes spot treat thoughout the day if I catch him itching, and as a last resort I use Benedryl topical to control the itching. No more steroid creams for us! One day of slacking on this regimen and we have issues! Good luck, I know it's frustrating!"
"I'm hooked I have definitely taken this company for granted, I wasn't so sure it would work but I did more research and found that this is a phenomenal company and their products are amazing! My 2 month old son developed baby eczema and I was prescribed by his doctor hydrocortisone which smelled weird and also left my baby's skin looking patchy so I stopped using that and was just using greasy Aquaphor, I then discovered this product and just after one use my sons neck (where most of the patchiness was) was cleared up over night! The smell is amazing! It smells to me like lemon cake I love that the products are 100 natural, non gmo, and organic! A little trick for the customers upset about the quality of the product just pop it in the microwave for 20 seconds stir until grittiness is gone then place it in the fridge until it hard again and boom just like new. Remember it's a natural product so there will be some separation but it's an easy fix."
"Totally cleared in 1 week! I never write reviews but it was because of the reviews that I tried this product for my daughter...so I felt an obligation to give back! My daughter has ....or had I should say eczema behind her knees and she could not wear shorts all summer!! Until we started using this 'liquid gold'! I will never be without this cream, customer for life!!!"
"Love this!!! My baby had very dry spots on his body (mainly his buttocks) and the Johnsons lotion and petroleum jelly wasn't working at all, it was actually making it worse. So I visited my local CVS and saw this and decided I'd try it out bexcuse the dry places couldn't possibly get any worse as it was scaly. When I opened it, I was very pleased with the smell it's not too loud and it smells alot like Burts bees lip balm. So the next day after I put it on his skin, I immediately noticed a big change. His skin was very soft, not completely resolved but very close. The next day, it was almost completely gone and now it is the third day and the dryness is very faint, I believe it will be back to noemail tomorrow. I saw some reviews that complained about heating it up, but I just rub it between my fingers before applying and it does fine. I have nothing was positive things to say about this product and I will be looking into other Shea moisture products!! Also the price is very reasonable as I payed 11 for a 6 oz and you only need a small amount."
"Highly recommend! I discovered my son had eczema the first bath he received on the day of his birth at the hospital. The skin on his back and chest immediately reacted to the horrible Johnson Johnson body wash they were using. I was already a Shea moisture and Nubian Heritage fanatic, so when I saw the bumps on his skin I applied my lotion to calm his irritated skin. When my husband and brought little man home, we began to search for baby eczema products, not realizing we were already supporting a company that supported the very product we were seeking, LOL!!! It took about 4 weeks of research (we were using Burt's Bees Baby Wash Baby Lotion during that time-it wasn't working) and we finally discovered Raw Shea Butter Chamomile Argan Oil Baby Eczema Therapy by Shea Moisture. Our handsome son has never had an eczema outbreak since we began using this product and we don't plan on buying anything else. We bathe him with Shea Moistures Raw Shea Chamomile Argan Oil Baby Wash. All the other body washes we have tried by SM (trying to explore different fragrances) actually DID irritate his sensitive skin, so we immediately threw those out and went back to the Raw Shea... Argan."
"great product LOVE your product for 3 reasons: I use it on my spinning wheel when making yarn. I use it on my face to moisturize, take off makeup and minimize wrinkles. And it is natural!!! I'm allergic to preservatives..Thank You! Buying more soon. Bonnie"
Refreshing I have enjoyed using a variety of the Olay products for more than 30 years and consider them to be part of my life routine-wherever I am. As an international traveler they always make me feel like I am being cared for regardless of where I am. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"amazing! My family and I use this so much! It has great coverage, along with a tan, and smells great every spring break we stock up, but it never lasts!"
"Heat it up It's winter here, so when my jar arrived for my 3 month old son with eczema it was frozen. I put it in front of the heater while I gave him his bath, and by the time we were ready to apply the product it was nice and warm and melted. I dipped in and rubbed it between my palms until the white chunks were dissolved, then massaged it into my baby's dry and flaky rough skin. results were immediate! He was softer than ever before and he smelled absolutely amazing. 10/10 would recommend to anyone suffering from dry skin or eczema! Going to try it on his red/irritated cheeks tomorrow, will update review if it doesn't help. If it does help I'll just leave this as is lol"
Very Nice Product. Its a Very good Product to use. I will recommend this strongly.
"Bye Bye Eczema I purchased this product along with their eczema bar soap when my son was 6 months after many trails with other eczema products that failed to minimize his outbreaks. This product is the only one that delivered drastic results of improvement. My son is now 13 months. This product has lasted my son for a few months. The smell is lovely, the texture is great, the results are nearest to a cure, and the price is reasonable. I will be reordering my sons products since we are just now running low. Highly recommended!!! Thanks SheaMoisture!"
Love this for the whole family! I use this on my 9 and 11 year and for myself. It makes our skin so soft and the fragrance is wonderful. Just rub a bit in your palms and it melts instantly! I would definitely recommend it...especially in the winter.
"Love it! Awesome product, I use it for my baby, for me and basically my whole family uses it."
"Review We use this cream on our kids everyday especially in the winter sometimes twice/day. We don't use any other lotions anymore especially since most have alcohol in them it was burning their skin and they would cry but not with this one! The only part is the consistency is a bit well less than easily spreadable but, we put a small dab of coconut oil with each application and rub it in your hands first and it goes on perfectly smooth! Plus it smells great!"
"DIG Luxurious Moisture! We live in Syracuse, NY region, where snowfall is immense winters are brutal. Hair skin are subject to dryness from indoor heating outdoor sub-zero temps: -25F past winter. Each September, as soon as temps drop from 80's/90's to 70's, my skin seems to sense the oncoming winter, instantly/overnight goes into 9 solid months of winter shock- Eczema flares on 1 elbow, hands immediately become bone-dry, chap, crack, have sharp edges of dried, peeling skin, bleed, become beet-red/raw, appear OLD. I've tried everything, from pure Vaseline (petroleum), to cortisone creams. This Baby Eczema Cream is a miracle! My hands are young again after just a few days of using this cream. (It protects my skin to allow healing, while preventing further damage, keeping skin soft, supple, young.) It's so rich! After 1/2 hour or so, it absorbs into skin- but keeps my skin moisturized protected all day- without that artificial, greasy feel of aquaphor (Vaseline). I once shook my Dr's hand upon greeting, after I'd applied aquaphor 5 hours earlier... I was so embarrassed that my hand felt greasy gross (to him). This miracle cream sinks in moisturizes much better, without that greasy/grimy/gross skin feel. I apply every am, re-apply after soap-washing my hands, again before bed. I smooth this cream onto my forearms lower legs, too. The fragrance is delicate- but unisex- the oils in this cream hold onto my perfume all day, too. DIG IT !!!"

"I LOVE IT I bought this for my LO yesterday because she have dry skin and its the first baby product i like it smells so good and melts on skin,would recommend to any moms out there."
Great Product !! This Product is amazing!! I bought it for my kiddos and fell in love with it for myself also. I have very dry skin and this works wonderfully. I personally enjoy the fragrance also. It is a very thick cream so if you are looking for something of a shear moisture this not your product. But if you are like me and need something stronger this is wonderful. The big plus is that it last all day and gave me baby soft skin. The only draw back that I have found is that it is never in stock at the store and Target won't sell it on line.
Best sun tan lotion I have used this since I was in 8th grade and still continue to. It is the best smelling lotion out there!
"Love it! This stuff is great on little arms, knees, elbows, and chapped cheeks - basically everywhere! I love that it seems to melt in my hands as I apply it to my girls warm little bodies! It is so wonderful and smells great too."

"The best! This cream is thick and heavy so it is already better for dryness than the other natural baby moisturizing creams at Target, which are thick and light. I can't be sure but it also seems to soothe redness just as good as the baby calendula creams. I've got a dresser covered in baby creams but this is the only one I need to heal my daughter's dry skin, rashes, bug bites, and pimples. I also use it after her bath. Even though It is thick, it is really easy to rub in. The only thing I don't like is the strong vanilla scent. However, it is a natural scent and since there is nothing that comes near this cream as far as effectiveness, I tolerate it."
"LOVE IT!!! I just purchased this product today and I am in love! It smells so good and I love that it doesn't have anything bad in the ingredients. Just natural, organic, goodness. This stuff is SUPER thick. Really have to squeeze the bottle to get it out, but as soon as you start applying it to the skin it softens, almost a melting effect and allows you to spread it easily. I will post another rating after I have some time to evaluate its effectiveness but so far I really like it. Used it as a balm on my baby's diaper area, some on his red, dry cheeks, and on my daughters eczema patches. We will see!"
"Amazing! This cream is amazing! My daughter has had severe eczema since she was a baby (she's 5 now). I have tried everything from oatmeal baths to wet wrap therapy, not to mention a long list of creams. This cleared up her eczema within a week. I guess I'm in the minority here, but I love the sandy texture. It melts as soon as it touches my daughter's skin. She calls it her 'sand therapy'. We both love this product!"
"Can't live without this product This shea butter product is simply heavenly. While I don't have Eczema, I do have dry skin, especially in the winter. The combination of shea and argan oil provide enough moisture to keep my skin soft and supple. The Frank and Myrrh scent is actually very light and smells more like a baby soft scent. My only criticism is that often the jars will have a lumpy product which makes it hard to use because it is grainy and hard to melt. I have figured out that if I stick it in the microwave for about 30-45 seconds then let it cool in the fridge it will smooth it out and make it creamy and smooths on easier."
"Magic! This is a little difficult to use at first but, if you have dry patches any where (especially the heels of your feet) this stuff is fantastic. You do have to melt it in your hands and then apply. It WILL soak in very quickly so don't panic when you first put it on and you are shiny! Natural and smells great! I use it about 3 times a week and have received so many compliments on how soft my skin is!"

"The best treatment for baby ezcema! My 3 month old bb suffered from a moderate case of ezcema on this belly, back, and elbows. He even has skin discoloration on his tummy and back associated with the dry patches. I purchased this moisturizer on Sunday night from Target (in store), and I put it on him before bed. My husband then put it on him Monday morning. By the time I went to put it on him Monday night before bed (8pm) the dry skin and bumps were completely gone! The skin discoloration is fading too:) It truly is the best moisturizer ever. I am thinking about using it for myself!"
this product is awesome I've finally found what I was searching for for my baby this product is wonderful! Its not greasy at all it has a awesome cent ! I just simply love it!! I have to tell my family and friends that have children to definitely try this product!!! Don't normally leave reviews but I had too for this product!! The oil is fabulous as well!!
"australian gold I love this product, but disappointed that I can't find it any place but on your website. keep this product!!!"
"Amazing! My newborn daughter had a severe case of eczema, her pediatrician had referred us to a dermatologist. In between the 2 weeks of her pediatrician seeing her and her dermatologist visit I was so desperate to try anything to soothe her. I saw this at our local target and decided to give it a try, I'm so glad I did! In 1 day I saw a dramatic improvement, in 3 days her eczema was completely gone that I no longer had to go to her dermatologist appt. since they would probably see nothing wrong. Her skin is so soft the way a baby's skin should be. Her pediatrician was so pleasantly surprised. I can't say enough about this line, I use the body was and lotion on her and her skin is amazing!"
The Best Baby product for skin Its Gentle and soothes my little girl's skin. Beautiful smell too.
"Healed my newborn son's eczema in a matter of days This stuff is seriously amazing. When my son was about 5 weeks old, he broke out in horrible eczema on his face. It was so bad it looked like he got a burn on his cheek, so we got this at Target to see if it would help. We used it on him that night and by the next day it was significantly better. His face was back to normal in less than a week! We have to keep putting it on him everyday so that it stays under control. He's now 8 weeks old and it's still working great. It's got a nice fragrance, although I wish it wasn't so strong. When you have to use a lot of it, it can be a little overwhelming for a few minutes until it absorbs. I'm also not a fan of the texture, but the oils is what helps it to work, so I'm ok with that. It helped my son tremendously so that alone deserves 5 stars."
I LOVE this product!! my husband purchased this cream for our daughter 2 days ago and its AMAZING!! my daughter suffers from eczema and this stuff really helped with the dry rough patches on her arms. its really thick but as soon as you begin to rub it on skin it melts and its easy to apply. it has a very light vanilla/chamomile scent. but everything in it is organic/natural making it a great option for toddlers with eczema. there is already a huge difference in my 1 year olds skin. I highly recommend this product to moms looking for something for eczema or simply dry skin. its amazing I will keep on buying it.
"Awesome product! This has worked wonders on my son's very dry skin! Living in Minnesota is hard on skin to begin with, this product has made a huge difference. The texture is different than other products we have used, but is very moisturizing and smells great!"
"I hope they haven't discontinued this - contains an amazing array of butters! For those who have ""sandy"" or grainy butters; microwave the open jar for a few seconds at a time until the butter melts. Cap and shake gently till all the grains dissolve. Place IMMEDIATELY in the FREEZER. Let chill till completely firm and it will be smooth as new when the product returns to room temperature.BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERHEAT TO AVOID RISK OF INJURY FROM BURNS"
"Amazing! I originally purchased this for my 4 year old son as he has a mild case of dry skin in various places but he hated the texture and refused to wear it as it feels like sand when you initially put it on (but after a good rub, it blends in). I decided to use it myself since my skin had become super dry and itchy after my second baby three months ago. This stuff is absolutely wonderful! It feels so good on my skin and has completely healed my skin."
"Working Well on Severe Areas I would definitely not recommend this as an all over lotion. However, for the worst areas of eczema on my little guy (hard, scaly and super dry) this is working better than either the special lotion or balm products we have tried. It does require a lot of rubbing to get it on well as it is a bit more of a gritty paste than lotion. But, once rubbed in, it moisturizes extremely well and doesn't leave the greasy residue behind a balm or even some lotions do. It also smells good :)"
"Smell I hate this lotion! I guess I should have smelled it before I purchased it. The smell is overpowering and nauseating. I put it on the first time and washed it off immediately. I keep trying to adjust to the smell, but it's just too much. I will be throwing the rest of the bottle away. You've been warned - the smell is obnoxious."
"Peels off After a few minutes, this lotion forms a coating on the skin which starts rubbing, or peeling off in flakes when touched. Even gets onto clothing. First time I ever felt the need to wash off lotion from my skin with soap and water!"
"The best tanning lotion I have used this tanning lotion for years, it has the best smell and keeps your skin soft."
Scent too strong to use on hands Only for body. Not for hands. Scent too strong for my preference.
Terrible smell I love Aveeno products and thought I'd try this based on reviews. I will definitely go back to the fragrance free and Souffle.
"nice smell I use this on occasion, I like the smell, doesn't seem to bother my skin"
"I feel relaxed, hydrated and my skin feels soft all day long I've been using this product for about 2 months and is perfect. After a busy day at work this product makes me relax and enjoy my me time. Its gentle perfume lasts very long and my skin gets hydrated and so soft. Please Aveeno do not make any changes to this product, it really rocks."
"Great scent! As long as your skin isn't severely dry, this moisturizing lotion works great, and has a great stress relieving scent to add to the pleasure. You'll feel more relaxed after your evening shower, or feel de-stressed and ready to tackle your day after your morning shower. Or just use it in the middle of the day when needed, and enjoy the scent and how soft your skin feels after using this product."
"Well Tested Stress Relief It has been difficult in this poor economy to find work to be the family man I desire to be. In the mean time it has helped me relax and be less angry living with family members. The three year study has satisfied my creativity. Although I never got to know anyone in college, to lower stress to complete classes, it was nice to have a product that oily enough to wash away, but chalky enough to hold consistency for in between bathing periods."
Stress Relief Moisturizing Lotion This lotion is absolutely awesome! It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth with no greasy film. I use this every day! This is my absolute favorite lotion!!
"Wonderful sent. I love the combination of lavender, chamomile and ylang ylang. The smell is clean and fresh. Not to sweet or flowery. My husband likes the scent too. :)"
love it! I use this lotion daily. I love the smell! I also have continued to use it as my moisturizer during pregnancy and it has worked wonderfully.

"Absolutely the Best This product that I have passed by so many times in the store, is absolutely the best body lotion I have ever used. 58 brings it's skin challenges but with in 2 days I noticed a remarkable change in my skin."
Lotion I really like that it has no greasy feel.
Love this lotion I love this product. I enjoy the smell and feel that it has. It doesn't leave me with that icky feeling after I put it on like other product lotions ive tried. I put this lotion on at least twice a day.
Very Surprised This lotion came in a baby gift pack. I tried it and will be running to the store tomorrow to purchase it. Another good way to de-stress. Unique scent that even the house pets are intrigued by...:)
"Perfectly moisturizing. After the death of my son in June 2013, a sweet friend gave this to me. I have used it every single night before bed ever since. It is calming and definitely moisturizing. It's perfect."
Wonderful I use this EVERY NIGHT when I get home from work just before I go to bed! I love the way it moisturizes my hands and that wonderful scent!! It helps me unwind after a long night at work!
Amazing nighttime love for my skin! I use this every night before I go to sleep to calm me down for the night! It's amazing how the lavender mixed with the creamy lotion can really make me feel relaxed! Love this stuff!
amazing! Only lotion I will EVER use on my skin! Absolutely love it!! Nothing has ever worked to smooth my skin before this. My skin was visibly softer after only two uses!! And it lasted!
"Amazin! This is the most amazing lotion! It's extra emollient, without leaving skin feeling greasy. I love the smell. It's not too over-powering and truly does make me feel more relaxed."
sp4 have been using SP4 for years wouldn't consider anything else
so relaxing! I have a bottle of this at every sink in my house. My whole family uses it just to help us all feel more calm. I could not recommend this product enough! I love love love it!
"The smell is a little piece of heaven!! This product gives my skin the perfect amount of moisture and it smells AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I truly wish it came in body wash, body spray, anything, everything!"
Good cream thank you
"highly recommended!!! This is the only lotion that catches my taste. I love the smell, its very mild, it doesnt give me headache and my husband and my kids love the smell. Kids are honest!!!"
Great stuff! Love it!
Love it! I love the lavender scent and the fact that it does absorb quickly into the skin. But I can't find it in any stores lately. The only one I find is unscented. :(
ahhhhh.. Ahhh is how this lotion makes you feel!! It seems to lift your spirits right from the soothing smell roght down to the creamy feel of it going on! Love it!!
"New moms relief! I was given a gift of this lotion and the matching body wash after having my baby. It was a great gift as it made me feel good about myself. It had a great smell, made me feel good to do something nice for myself and it was safe to snuggle with baby after applying to my skin. Nothing but praises here!!! Since then, I have included these products at baby showers for the new moms."
where have you been all my life! I am so happy with this aveeno lotion! One year I worked in a place that had no heat and with out realizing I was typing away little by little I noticed that the cold frozen my hands. Just rwcantly I bought this lotion and already I see a really great result and they even got smoother! Ps the smell is so relaxing and not over powering. I would highly recommend this product.
Stress soother I feel is a good product as I suffer from depression and PTSD. I use this to help stay calm and relaxed as I have 3 little ones to keep me quit stressed. My kids all love lotion and to have it have calming agents in it is great for the kids and I. It's a perk that it calms them down. It's a good product all around and keep us happy for the most part! Thanks aveeno
Excellent product I am very pleased with this purchase. I cannot find this in any stores so I am happy that I can purchase this online.
"Goodbye dry skin This winter my skin was at it's worst with dryness, my usual for very dry skin products didn't seem to do anything. Aveeno Stress Relief Moisturizing lotion softened and moisturized my skin almost immediately when I applied it. The light scent is a plus too! I will be due at the end of February and have already started to stock up on Aveeno baby products."
"Best lotion EVER!!!!! This lotion is by far the best lotion I have ever used! It absorbs quickly into skin without leaving a heavy feeling, but leaves your hands/body moisturized for hours. The smell is delightful, and it truly does relieve my stress because it works so good. I would highly recommend this and do to just about everyone looking for a new lotion to try!"
Great for skin repair I have very sensitive and Aveeno products are very effective when dealing with sensitive as well as normal skin too. Do not hesitate to use this product and the baby products are wonderful for babies and shhh I tend to use them as well since they smell so good. :)
ONLY LOTION I USE I am a lotions potions girl and try everything and anything! THIS IS MY LOTION. It has a soft light smell thats clean and really is calming. I put it on right after the shower and you don't need much so it lasts awhile. Leaves skin soft and smooth doesn't feel like it leaves a film on top of skin and is great for use in summer and winter.
"Best smelling lotion ever I use this lotion every day. It's the best I've tried. It's non-greasy, super hydrating, and it lasts. But even better, I love the scent. I wish Aveeno would bottle the fragrance. I'm sensitive to a lot of fragrances, and hardly every wear perfume for that reason, but this subtle scent is heavenly. I wish it lasted longer."
"Lifesaver! I struggle with extremely sensitive skin and terrible dryness on account of my type 1 diabetes... This is the only thing I have found that my skin drinks up... My intense itching is a thing of the past. I use the baby products on my son and have since bought body wash, shampoo, and conditioner! THANK YOU AVEENO!"
"Smells Absolutely Devine! I am a huge fan of Lavender and products containing Lavender, this by far has to be one of the most amazing smelling lotions I have ever used. It keeps my hands and arms so soft while giving me that dose of calming soothing Lavender to help me relax. Highly recommend this lotion and will continue to buy."
Fantastic! Tried a lot of lavender products but this is the BEST. A light lavender fragrance that is not too strong for allergy sufferers. Please AVEENO never stop making this wonderful product! I buy several when I need one. Thick and creamy with just the right amount of fragrance definitely not too strong.
"Lovely smell, soft skin I love this lotion. It lasts a long time and does not feel oily. The reviewer who claimed the lotion had an obnoxious smell I get compliments all the time on the scent, so it's clearly just not something she or he cares for. That's it. Highly recommended. I also use the body wash."
Best Lotion On The Market I love Aveeno products! I'm pregnantthis lotion keeps me calm all day long. I apply and feel the stress melting away. I can't wait to use the Aveeno baby set for my unborn son when he gets here this spring. I've switched products long ago and it was definitely the right choice!
Wonderful Product I became a fan of Australian Gold years ago in Florida - it was not available at that time in CT so I managed to order it on line. Recently I notice this brand is in most discount and drug stores - but 4 is not so I looked at your website and delighted to see the array of products. I tan easily and 4 is just perfect for me - I get some protection and a very golden tan.
Incredible!!! It sounds like mumbo jumbo that this lotion would 'calm' you but I can tell you from experience that it works. This leaves your skin feeling moist and hydrated throughout the entire day! Every time I buy a product from Aveeno I just become for and more obssessed with the brand.
"Best Lotion on the market I have been using Aveeno stress relief lotion for years, it is the only lotion in the market that is truely an all day moisturizer. I have tried other products, but they make my skin feel dry. I will never use any other product, I'm sold for life!"
"I am in love with this lotion My coworker happened to have this lotion at her desk and the first time I tried it I was in love with the smell and the way it feels on my skin, I always thought Aveeno products were a bit pricey for my budget but it is worth spending the money."
Love this lotion but wish they made a bigger size This has become my favorite lotion from aveeno and I use a lot of it. I just wish that they could make either a larger size or a refill bottle so I wouldn't have to keep getting new bottles. Either way I will continue to use this lotion.
Great Lotion I would definitely recommend the Aveno lotion your body feels really soft when using it.
"Excellent for dry, sensitive skin I have very sensitive skin. Allergic to most body lotions. Tried this one because I use the face moisturizers in this brand and I'm not allergic to them. I was excited that there are so many options in the Aveeno brand. This particular one smells great and really does last 24 hours. The next day my skin still feels moisturized. I use their over night intensive itch relief for my dry feet but I could use this just as well. Very silky and relaxing. Good amount for the money at Walmart. Other places charge 10.00. I keep it in the fridge now that the hot days are here and ...aaaahhhhhhh!!"
"I MUST have this, ALWAYS. This is the one lotion I keep stocked. I always have one on my desk at work. I've tried everything and nothing works as well. I have a ton of brands I love and continue to buy for variety in my life but this is the one that I always come back to and use almost on a daily basis. The smell is very light which is important cause lavender lotions are usually too strong for me. The lotion is highly effective and takes care of my sandpaper elbows and dry hands in the winter. In fact, I just took a break while writing this to use some on my dry, winter wind-blown hands. I've never really gotten an (sigh), ahhhhhh, that's better feeling with lotions but I do with this one. LOVE this lotion on myself and my baby. She loves the smell too. I put my hand to her nose and she sniffs and gets a big smile on her face and then starts to nuzzle my hand and cuddles it. Baby approved and mommy approved :)"
"LOVE EVERYTHING AVEENO I agree w/the previous review, the more products that i use, the more obsessed I become w/Aveeno! This lotion is awesome. My son has a skin condition, he doesn't produce any natural oils. So, the daily lotion regimin is our life :) I have used MANY MANY products, even some VERY expensive prescription ones (rediculous, the cost, FOR LOTION, and the TINIEST tubes! that I need to use on my sons entire body)! RIGHT. anyway, I tried Aveeno and always went back to it, i'll never buy anything else. My sons skin literally feels soft, he's 7 yrs old now and loves not having aligator/snake skin anymore (most days, winter is worse for him, of course). I buy the Stress one b/c it DOES really work and I do it before bed so I think its nice for him... for sleep...and for me, since I apply to him :)"
"My skin looks younger, and so soft I love lavender! I get compliments on how nice I smell. People have inquired, what is that it smells heavenly, it's Aveeno. I've been using Aveeno for years. I started out with the daily moisturizing lotion with sunscreen, well still use it every day. I found it to be far superior as a facial moisturizer than all the other moisturizers I've purchased. I put it on at night and by morning, my face looked years younger. My hands tend to get dry and crack in the low humidity of fall and winter, not anymore thanks to Aveeno, and my hands are so soft. Now I've added the stress relief to my daily routine. Love it love it...Love it!! I will never use any product other than Aveeno, simply the best."
Love Lavender. Love Aveeno on my skin. I wrote because I read Jay's review (Redland). He wrote that he loves the smell. Couldn't agree more. A lot of men don't know it but lavender is used in most men's fragrances because men love the smell. I love the flower and I love anything with its scent. Plus the feel and effectiveness of Aveeno moisturizing is worth the money. It goes on without being oily and it works.
"Smooth, gentle, non-irritating lotion This is silky-smooth, easily absorbed sunscreen lotion with a light and fresh fragrance. My hubby loves it even more than I do and uses it more than I do!"
"Great Scent, Great Results I have sensitive skin, and in the winter my skin gets really dry and itchy. I've used Aveeno for years, but only the fragrance-free lotions. I decided to give the Stress Relief one a try (mainly because of the awesome scents it has) and I put it on right after a bath last night. I'm in love with it already! I love the way it smells, the scent of it is alluring and overpowering, and as time passes the scent starts to fade away, but it's essence is still there! Also, my entire body feels smooth, soft, hydrated, and not itchy at all. I don't know for sure if the stress-relieving properties take place, but I do know that I don't feel stressed at all I guess I'll find out. I love this lotion!"
"Cleared up my son's eczema in just a few days! My four year old son suffered from severe eczema almost his whole life. I tried every doctor's suggestion as well as every quack remedy I could find and nothing made the slightest difference. Then a friend told me this lotion cleared up her daughter's eczema so I decided to try it. It was amazing! After just a few days the eczema was nearly gone. His skin is smooth again and he doesn't wake up crying and itching anymore! I know the product is not advertised to help eczema, but it sure helped my son! It also works great for me as a regular lotion. It is a nice consistency and is a great relief to my skin--I live in a very dry climate and it makes a huge difference."
"Best lotion available anywhere! I have very dry skin, and working in a restaurant requires washing my hands several times an hour, all day long. I went to buy a new lotion when the backs of my hands were actually BLEEDING, and this is what I came home with. I will never buy another kind. In just 2 days my hands went from cracked and bleeding all over to silky smooth. And the smell is FANTASTIC. So soothing, I just can't get over it. I sometimes use more than I need to just to smell it. And as a final point, I never write online reviews. NEVER. The excellence of this product compelled me to start. Thank you Aveeno for solving all of my skin problems and more!"
"great smell! feels good on skin, and love the smell."
"Aveeno Stress Relief I had my 5th child 2 years ago,a bottle of Aveeno Stress Relief was given to me as a present.Perhaps because of the name,Stress Relief,I used this daily.This is absolutely the best lotion I had ever used.I had no real time to myself but I used this after every shower and at bedtime.It made my skin so smooth and the lavender and chamomile was so relaxing.I feel like I'm doing something nice for myself.Also the product itself seemed to last forever,I didn't have to put on tons of it,which saves me time and money.I still use it and love it."
"I always go back to it! I have been using this product for over 4 years, I something think its time for a change, then go off and buy another product only to go through breakouts, oily skin and just general bad experiences. Its so gentle on my skin and everyone comments on it. I use it on my whole body after showering twice a week and also on my face sparingly. Really recommend this product for combination skin like mine, and especially on the whole body. I just wish it came in a larger bottle pack, it runs out quickly a the rate I use it."
"i hate lavender! this lotion is so wonderful. i hate the scent of lavender, but this lotion does not have that strong lavender scent. it is an awesome blend. it goes on nicely and absorbs well. no residue or film on your skin feels naturally soft. it is calming and relaxing. i really appreciate this product. i can't find a larger bottle though like other Aveeno lotions. Aveeno is the ONLY lotion i have used for the past 5 years. i don't even notice other brands. good quality stuff."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE love this product. i have really sensitive and dry skin so I've tried every product possible. Aveeno worked the best for me, it moisturizes and soothes my skin. I started with the original lotion buti love the scent of this lotion, its not to strong, and is very calming after a shower after I've completed a 12 hour shift."
"Soothing and no skin reactions I've been using this product for a few years now. I tried to switch over to a different moisturizing product and broke out all over my legs after shaving. It was terrible. I love to use this product after showering and I feel that it leaves my skin soft long after I apply it. The lotion goes on thick so I make sure to work it into my skin. I highly recommend this, especially since I tried to switch products and it wasn't a very good idea. Thanks Aveeno!"
Great product I love this body lotion. I bought the body wash first and it's lasted me so long.. and is always wonderful to use before bed but i like the smell so much I was hoping i would find a body lotion with the same scent and I did and my dry winter skin (I live in Nothern Ontario Canada) is instantly soothed and feels soft and I smell amazing. The scent is so relaxing and not over powering. I will tell everyone about this product.
"Perfect Face Regenerist hydration cream is the best product I have found. It hydrates your face so that is feels baby soft, smooth's away fine lines. Fills in all the little imperfection's that you might have. I highly recommend this product for over 55. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
The Best lotion there is I have been buying Australian Gold since around 1990 I believe. It's been so long I can't remember when I started buying it. It is the only lotion I will buy. I bought another kind way back when and I broke out in a rash and my face swelled up. Since using Australian Gold this has never happened. It keeps my skin moist and soft and I never feel dried out after being in the sun. I am a sun worshipper so I need to have some protection. I do not burn easy and find I like the 4 the best as I get a beautiful tan without burning. When out with my friends they are always using my lotion. Also I love the smell of the lotion. Everyone says I smell like a pina colada. I usually have on hand at least two or three and have a bottle in every beach bag. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"stress relief/ chamomile I love this product I've been using it for years and I refuse to waste my money and time of buying any other lotions. Aveeno keeps my skin smooth soft and healthy unlike all the other water down lotions with perfume that doesn't give my skin the nutrients it needs. I will recommend Aveeno to anyone. It's great for those who have dry skin,eczema, and those who have sensitive skin."
"my skin feels amazing I love this lotion! The stress relief truly does work because i have a coworker who i truly dislike and i have to of course get along with her regardless, But ever since i started using this lotion it keeps me at ease. And it smells great. I use it after i take a shower. And before i enter into to stresful situations i.e. work. Every girl should have this in her room somewhere."
"Wonderful It beats paying for more expensive lotions and smells wonderful. I bought it for a friend for Christmas, but I like it too. Not sure why we can't find it on the Walmart shelves."
Not such a good Web site is very confusing. I believed I was ordering 6 bottles at 4.35 eash insteas I recieved 3 bottles for 23.39.I ended up paying 7.50 a bottle. Not such a good deal
Four Stars good
"Great Product! I liked the gel consistency and the way it cleans my porcelain sink. Works great! I have always liked the Soft Scrub products, but the gel isn't as gritty. Highly recommend."
Five Stars Exactly what I was looking for and at the right price.
"Say it isn't so! I have been using this product for many years and loving it. The amount of bleach is not too much and it is not gritty which makes me think it is scratching the surface. Recently, I am having difficulty finding it in stores and started to think it is being discontinued. Please, NO, that cannot be so! I did notice online that there is a new product in a black bottle. Is that the replacement I would like to know more about it, please, if the Soft Scrub Gel is being discontinued. Why does everything I like get discontinued"
Five Stars i like this product
Great Product Love this product. Stores like meijer and Kroger quit carrying it. I like to use it when I have rinsed chicken to clean the sink
Fantastic lotion on the market! I have been buying this for over 10 years. It id silky smooth and the coconut smell is fantastic. I would recommend this product to everyone. The best lotion on the market! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Soft Scrub I use this solely to clean my tub and it is amazing. The smell is not strong at all. It removes dirt easily. You don't have scrub just wipe it off and it's clean.
"Makes me feel sticky I can not recommend this lotion, it doesn't relieve the itch. It isn't absorbed by the skin so it feels sticky and tacky, very uncomfortable under clothing. This friction keeps the itchy spot feeling itchy. Also, you smell medicated all day."
"I still itch I have given this a week to see if it works, no it does not not even a little bit. I have mosquito bites and they itch, they itch a few minutes I put this on , they still itch a half hour later. They itch. Not less about the same. It smells nice and will be an acceptable lotion but this does not stop any kind of itch."
"Good Product, prefer skin relief with cooling menthol! This product does a nice job, but I believe the cooling menthol does it even better. I wish that product wasn't discontinued. I can't find it anywhere. I have extremely sensitive skin so the cooling menthol did the job. I appreciate the new ezcema brand but i still would like to see like to some thing more with cooling menthol. Thank you."
"Doesn't work for me on rashes/poison ivy. I'm prone to allergic rashes and poison ivy and I buy different products to see what works best. This doesn't work much for me for the rashes or poison ivy. sorry, but I can't recommend this to anyone else."
What happen to the cream I was buying the product every month when it was a cream. This particular brand really works for every season. I really miss the jar because cream is more effective and last longer.
Site did not allow shipping to Neighborhood Store Product was fine. Purchasing through Walmart online was fine. I have made several purchases prior to this about 1 1/2 years ago and was able to ship to a Walmart Neighborhood Store. Is that method of shipping only available for certain products Would have been nice to save on the shipping. I would purchase more online if it could ship without cost to a WNS.
"stops the itch it works , stops itching irritation"
"I wish they would sell this in stores again I have used the anit-itch concentrated lotion for hives, resulting from many allergies, for about 10 years, and in the last couple years I have not been able to buy it locally, only online. It works, that's why I search it out! It's the only product that has ever given me relief. I really wish it were more available, I don't like their other anti-itch products as well that are available in the stores. They do not give the relief that this one does."
The best for your itch and your skin. I get itchy hands at times. My daughter got this to see if it would help. I am so thankful she did because it worked in no time. I recommend this to anyone with itchy skin. Also one night my dog was scratching so much she kept waking me so I tried a little of this. She stopped scratching and we both slept better. This is the best product for itchy skin that I've ever tried. It makes your skin feel soft too.
Great Smell I love this sunscreen so much that I use it daily for my body lotion!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Best product I've tried...and I've tried them all I suffer from REALLY bad itchy skin during the mold season. I've tried just about everything out there and nothing comes close to this product. It does a really good job of calming skin. The only drawback is that it starts to wear off after about 2 hours. I wish they made it in a larger quantity and I wish I could be tied to a giant popsicle stick and dipped in it.
Great for itchy skin and rashes... We bought this for my step daughter When she came to visit she had dry red patches on her arms.. they looked very irritated and she said it itched and hurt her..This cream helped the rash n made her feel more comfortable. .Thank you so much! Anyone suffering from itchy dry..irritated skin should give this a try!
It WORKS I have polycythaemia which causes a lot of itching. Benadryl cream and hydrocortisone has not been able to stop it. Aveeno Anti Itch stopped it within seconds. A friend gave me a bottle of this lotion and I had tried everywhere in town to find it. I am now going to order several bottles of this on line.
"Great Stuff! If there's one thing I hate it's to itch! It truly is one of the most uncomfortable feelings, and the only thing you can think about when you're itching is finding a way to make it stop. Enter AVEENO Anti-Itch Concentrated Lotion. It helps. You have to try it for yourself to see the difference it makes!"
"Perfect relief I have diabetes and stage 4 colon cancer. With the diabetes and previous chemo treatments my skin stays so dry and itchy. I was told to try this so I took the chance and did. It works wonders. My skin feels soft and smooth, not greasy and I do not have that itchy feeling."
"Thanks for this wonderful product!!! I am 33 weeks pregnant and presently at a point where I keep on scratching my my whole body. My skin is super itchy and nothing seems to work for me, after trying so many other products I finally found relief in Aveeno anti itch lotion...."
"Nothing better! This product is the best anti-itch cream I have tried. It's perfect for mosquito bites, bee stings, poison oak, or just general itchy skin. Unfortunately, it is hard to find. I will definately order several bottles online!"
Say good bye to your itchy skin. Aveeno is a wonderful produce that helps relieve your itchy skin...
Anti -itch I have very dry itchy skin in the winter so I started my daily routine with ave no oatmeal bar soap and then anti-itch lotion and it has working wonders on my skin.
got itchy skin when I had an reaction to itchy skin due to dryness I was recommended to try Aveeno anti itch lotion and to my suprize it worked like Magic. my dry itchy skin was moisterized and itch free. I'm very well satisfied.
"Great Works great as a sunscreen, I also love the scent and not greasy This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"relieves the itching, redness love this product. works great all year round with bug bites, redness, minor skin irritations. helps soothe the skin better than prescription products."
"Aveeno fabulous It does take the itchy away once I apply on my skin. Super help for rash, dryness skin, anti itch, poison ivy rash. Love this product. Keep me at ease!"
"24 hour relief It not only does it help with itching, its great on the legs after shaving. This is the only product that does not iratate my skin after shaving."
"winter skin Great product for dry, itchy winter skin! I also use the skin relief shower and bath oil, which is equally as awesome!"
great relief for rosesea I like the oatmeal base and it helps a lot-have problems with other anti-itch creams because of their harsh bases-helps to clear up my skin and leaves it soft and supple.
Great stuff Works on everything from an itchy rash to bug bites! Nothing better!
"Best OTC lotion for poison ivy I have tried many products over the years with my bouts with poison ivy. This is the best lotion I have used would even compare it to the prescription cream. It has the color of calamine lotion but not the smell. It soothes your skin, stops the aggravating itching and helps with healing process of poison ivy."
"Used for contact dermatitis Works well for relieving symptoms as a temporary relief. Of all the over the counter products tried, I like this one the best."
"Much needed help post shingles rash I had shingles on forehead, eye and scalp. After rash went away, I developed post-herpetic pain, but more intense was the deep itching. I am 3 months past the shingles rash, but the doctors say the itching can last months and sometimes forever. I have tried a lot of products, but this concentrated formula with a topical pain relief helps both the pain and itching I experience. It is a deep, deep itch and with my skin still being numb, I have to be very careful not to scratch. It is really strange having both numbness with pain and itching. Anyway, This Aveeno Anti-Itch Concentrated formula gives sweet relief. I make sure not to get any in my eye, but smooth it on my eye area, forehead and on my scalp. The worst itching I have ever had and I am very grateful to find this product for post-herpetic itching from shingles rash. Thanks Aveeno!"
Aveno itch medicine best lotion for stopping and repairing skin that itches. I has a great ability to heal skin problems.
"Solution for the hard to find In the summer we live outside! Once the deep tan has set in we still want sun protection that stays on and moisturizers. The only solution is Austrailan Gold SPF 4. The lotion keeps the darkest tan smooth and silky on the hottest days. Buy at least two for your beach days because everyone will borrow it! Best sun protection ever, based on over 45 years in the sun! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Best Great
great fpr my Roscea I love this product- I starting using it in my early 50s and still use it- The oatmeal base is this product is great because other plain anti-itch products have bases that irritate my skin. I am now in my early 70s and my skin looks grrrrrrreat!
works better than other similar products works better than other similar products
"AVEENO-Anti-Itch-Concentrated lotion. I get a rash on my legs every year. Used just about everything to try and get rid of the itch from it, nothing seems to work. Try this cream with in 3 days the itch was gone and my legs are healing great. Would recommend this cream to anyone."
works good It is just to expensive for me to continue to use on my disability income. It did help with the problem I have with my skin with scleroderma.
"Mommy's magic lotion The concentrated anti itch lotion is a miracle for my daughter. She suffers from repeated allergic outbreaks due to her own anti bodies attacking themselves creating a severe, all over allergic reaction to the histamines her body produces. NOTHING worked to give her relief. Prescriptions, steroids, everything I could find brought no relief. We have had to endure watching our baby miserable on 4 separate occasions in this past year, each episode lasts 5-10 days. Swelling, hives, severe itching, pain burning:head to toe. We used Aveeno oatmeal baths to soothe her, sometimes 3 a day. Last time I saw this lotion as I was getting the oatmeal, I thought why not Tried everything else. I applied it all over her body, I became very concerned it was going to burn her hives where she scratched (due to smell of the lotion), it didn't. She said it felt good on her ithies. 30 minutes later i could tell the hives were looking better. I was still a bit skeptical. She woke up the next morning (after a great nights rest, 1st in days) came running to me, spinning around said Look mommy. It's almost all gone! Your magic lotion made me better! I was AMAZED. Needless to say:Aveeno concentrated anti itch lotion stays in stock at our house ( also, it goes a very long way. Coated her entire body 3-4 times now still on the same bottle). Thank you Aveeno!!! !"
good product walking well
"Great for bugbites!!! No matter how much bug repellent I use during this time of the year, I always seem to get bit up all over my legs, ankles, and feet. I have used all of the lotions and potions I could find and finally stumbled upon lotion because of my boyfriend and it was a miracle. After 10 minutes I didn't have that burning sensation to scratch my legs up. I put it on through out my day and before I go to bed. This will be the first summer I won't have a bunch of scratching scars all over my legs and I couldn't be happier. This will now be a staple in my house."
"Very happy My 12 yr old daughter had a terrible allergic reaction to something and she was miserable. My husband had started a new job so we still had 2 weeks before our insurance kicked in. We ordered this lotion because none of our local stores carried this product. It helped tremendously! My daughter used it a couple times a day along with Benedryl(oral), and showered with Aveeno skin relief shower gel. We would definitely buy this again!"
Baby's with skin problems This is the only products my daughter can use on her skin. She has very sensitive skin. We live their products.
"Wonderful Protection and Wonderful Smell I have been using this 4 after I've built up my tan using a stronger SPF, and I know I'm getting my sun protection while smelling fabulous. Even when I'm not outside, I use the lotion to smell great. And, I get complements. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love It!!! This is an awesome product it helps calm the irritation of my extremely dry and ichy skin I love it.
Soothing I get extreme heat rash and this has been the only product to sooth my skin.
"Disappointed This scent is truly AWFUL. I wanted to like it. I really did. However, I was very disappointed."
"Only con, never in stock Love the sunflower scent, wish they would keep it in stock when there's obviously a high demand for it. Also wish they would bring back the multi purpose cleaner."
"Please bring back Sunflower scent in other products!! I'm a Kindergarten teacher and use Mrs. Meyers products - including hand soap! - I in my classroom. I love knowing that they are as safe as they are effective. I have used the Sunflower scent exclusively for dishes and all-purpose cleaning as well (cleaning tabletops, etc.). It is by far my favorite scent: not too sweet, but kind of herb-y, spicy. Please please start making the other products in this yummy scent again! Please"
"Don't go away From the looks of things on this web site I gather that the sunflower scented products are being discontinued. That makes me sad as I really like this spicy scent. As with all Mrs Meyers hand soaps it cleans beyond compare, is gentle and effective. And Mrs Meyers makes the BEST hand soap dispensers comparable to none. I save all my old ones and use them for years. They never wear out."
"Please bring SUNFLOWER back!!! I used ALL of Mrs Meyers sunflower products, the counter spray, laundry detergent, and dish soap, Please please please bring Mrs Sunflower back!!!"
"Love it!! Got just the hand soap so that I could try out this new scent. Yes, it has a citrus undertone which I really like. (Lemon Verbena has been one of my favorites). People... sunflower is just a name! The real scent of sunflowers is not particularly inviting... but thinking about them makes people happy as this scent does for me. Will be ordering everything available in this scent. I have tried just about all the scents... and really only use Mrs. Meyers products in my kitchen. This is my new fave!! Love it!!"
Sunflower Hand Soap I'm a big fan of the Sunflower scented products. It's a spicy floral. I can't really describe it any other way. I love the way this hand soap smells! I hope it doesn't get discontinued. I have also purchased the Multi Surface Cleaner concentrate. I love how my kitchen and bathroom counters smell after I've cleaned.
Sunflower my fave I love the scent its amazing very light floral scent. Smells Yummy I use it all around the house. I use it for my cleaning business as well.
"Austrailian Gold 4 Lotion Sunscreen I have used the 4 lotion for years, I tried 8 but it was to much block I never got a tanned. I boat 5 to 6 days a week in the sunny waters of South Florida, I prefer lotion over spray, it keeps the surrounding area cleaner with no over spray The only Drawback is the stores in my area that carries Australian gold only stock spray sunscreens The best product Australian Gold has is the Moisture Lock Tan Extender, this product stops the hurt of a bad sunburn and my skin turns into a tan the next day this product is a miracle works wonders"
love fragrance I keep this Sunflower hand soap at kitchen sink. I will order dish soap next. This is my favorite next to Lemon Verbena
A favorite! We loved this one. The fragrance is complex and more fruity/grassy than floral. Am here ordering it again.
"Gorgeous scent Sunflower is my favorite scent, it's refreshing and delicious."
Plaese Please Please bring back sunflower in everything I LOVE LOVE LOVE SUNFLOWER am soooooo disappointed that it is discontinued!!!!!!! I love some of your other scents but sunflower was my absolute hands down favorite. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!!!!!
"Sunflower scent is the absolute best EVER!!! I love Sunflower scent and was truly devastated when the counter spray in this scent was discontinued. Lemon Verbena and Lavender are nice, but Sunflower was just that much more perfect. I live on a farm with real honeysuckle everywhere and the plants smell heavenly. Mrs. Meyer's Honeysuckle is just too much - as is Peony and Lilac. Kind of trashy! But Sunflower scent is the ultimate subtle summery scent. It is just a little bit of citronella with fruit loops in there too. It is my childhood summers in a bottle. Please, please, please, PLEASE consider bringing it back in the counter spray! Thank you!!!!"
Add my voice to the chorus! Give us back our Sunflower!
We need this scent in dishwashing liquid!!! When are making this available for dishwashing and surface cleaning!!! We love this classy scent so much.
Bring back this line please! I am running out of the last of my sunflower multi surface refill! This is easily my favorite scent and I even believe it cleans better!
My favorite scent! Please bring back Sunflower Dish Soap.
I love the Sunflower scent. Please bring back the Sunflower Dish Soap. This is your best scent.
Exact find So very happy that you had what I was looking for. Love this product
"SUNFLOWER is(sadly was) your BEST fragrance!! Please bring back sunflower in your cleaning products!! It is the only scent that everyone I know seems to like. People always remarked on the scent of my house too, when I had it -- they loved it. Truly, in my spheres, there seems to be no universal love for any other fragrance. It is clean, not too flowery, refreshing."
"I LOVE this scent! Please bring it back! I love this scent. It is not overpowering, and the detergent itself does an amazing job!!! Please bring back more items, especially the detergent!"
"Sunflower is your BEST scent I echo the other comments about my disappointment that this scent is no longer available in the multi surface cleaner. The scent is amazing and I recently ordered honeysuckle hoping maybe it would be as well. Sadly, it wasn't and now I miss the sunflower even more. Please consider bringing it back!!"
"Please bring back Sunflower scent in all products!!!! My wife has sensitivities to many scents and the sunflower scent, especially in the all-purpose cleaner, was a perfect combination of subtle and pleasant. That, in addition to your products being as good as they are, made for a hard-to-beat combination. Please consider bringing it back in the rest of your product line. It looks like we're not the only ones with this opinion..."
Please bring Sunflower back. Sunflower is such a pleasing scent it complementary and not at all overpowering like many others available in store. Please bring this back it's unfortunate to have this option discontinued in other product selections. Bummer.
"Please return more items in SUNFLOWER! I have never tried an ineffective product of yours. All the fragrances are great. But it seems many of my favorite fragrances become scarce (Basil air freshener spray) or goes away (especially in the laundry soap, cleaner -spray or concentrate-, or dish soap!) Sunflower is so cheery and awakening, I find it most welcome on dreary days. I love all your products and look forward to order a variety of fragrances. Thanks for keeping my home clean and smelling wonderful."
Please bring back Sunflower in all products Please bring back Sunflower scent in all cleaning products. This scent was amazing and made my house smell so clean and outdoors fresh. I really miss this scent.
"Please bring back Sunflower Of all the scents Mrs. Meyers makes this is my favorite! A couple of times while shopping I accidentally bought Honeysuckle and was so disappointed when I got home and realized it! I did not know until just now when I got on to the website, that it has been discontinued. Why, why, why!! Please bring it back! If you want to get rid of any scents, I can give you some suggestions...starting with Honeysuckle."
"BRING BACK THE SUNFLOWER SCENT! I'm commenting on the sunflower scent itself. I have been trying to find ALL the Mrs Meyer's products in this scent ever since I first tried it, and was disappointed to see that not all my favorite products--laundry dish soap, all purpose cleaner, laundry scent granules--are available in Sunflower. Now I see NONE of them are available in Sunflower anymore! This is pushing me toward my other favorite brand now that there's no special reason (for me) to buy MM. PLEASE BRING BACK SUNFLOWER!!! And thank you for making it! (No one asked me to write any of this.)"
"You'll never know how much I love you... Please don't take my SUNFLOWER away :) My favorite of all time! Please, please consider making other products in this scent again."
The Best! I have been using this for years. It not only protects from the sun but leave your skin soft because it hydrates. Would never use anything else!
I hope this comes back!! This my all-time favorite scent and I was so disappointed that it was discontinued. Please bring it back!!
"I miss it too! I was also disappointed to see that this scent was discontinued -- it was a favorite! not too strong or cloying like some of the florals -- along with Parsley, which was also discontinued except for the hand soap. I would happily buy Sunflower again if it were reintroduced in spray, dish soap, and laundry detergent, too. The same goes for Parsley!"
Very good product Due to the design of the opening when squeezed usually too much is released. An improved design of the opening that would better control the flow of the oil would be very convenient. Which is the reason for only 4 stars.
"Burned my skin I have occasional breakouts. I bought it to keep my pores clean. My skin is combination/oily. It is true that the product creates a cooling sensation but that is only during the washing process. About 10 minutes after I used the product my face felt like it was on fire. I figured it was the acne medicine in the product that was working. I continued to use the product for 3 more days. My face dried out, itched, and my skin hurt to touch it, and that was with using moisturizer after washing my face. Each day got progressively worse and then I started to have worse acne breakouts that were under the skin and very painful. I haven't had breakouts like that in years. Then I started noticing brown spots appear on the surface of my skin like my skin had been burned! I stopped using the product right away and switched to tea tree oil. My face stopped itching immediately and the redness went away. I was very disappointed and will NEVER use this product again."
"Biore Ice Cleanser It works like a charm to keep acne under control, and it feels so cool and refreshing on the skin! There's nothing else like it!"
Did alright I bought this two weeks ago to reduce my blemishes it reduced them the first 3 days a week later in getting more pimples like 4-6 I have moderate acne and I'm also a teenager so I wouldnt reccomend if u have moderate acne I would reccomend if u have mild acne might help u a little
"Biore does not work well with sensitive skin. I purchased the product as of 3 weeks ago and I did not see any results. The product did not reduce blemishes on my face, but increased redness. I felt that the item did not help and made my face extra dry. If your acne is not as bad like mine or severe, I recommended that you don't use this product."
"Great facial wash, not great shippers at store. Great facial wash; however, when received both bottle tops were unlocked and leaking. Not an issue with shipping, but issue with Target packer. Half of one bottle leaked all in box."
"Made My Face Break Out In the past I had used other Biore products, such as their moisturizers and blackhead strips, but this cleanser did not work for me. Every time I used it, would would dry my face out, and I would break out with small bumps on my face. And, obviously, it did not do anything for my acne. Would not recommend this cleanser, especially for sensitive skin."
its cool i thought it wasnt going to work but it did now i love it
Love this lotion! This is the best and only tanning lotion that I use. Stumbled across it several years ago while at the beaches and haven't used any other tanning lotion since. Gives you a fast and beautiful tan and it smells great! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
its cool i thought it wasnt going to workbut it did now i love it
"it works i used to have acne on my t-zone, but after using this cleanser it has cleared up. the results did not appear instantly, it took about a couple weeks before i saw results. this cleanser does not prevent oiliness, and can be drying if you dont use moisturizer, so i would not reccomend this for dry skin. those are the only flaws of this cleanser, otherwise, this is an excellent cleanser."
"What Acne?? I used to have T-Zone acne...ever since I have been using this product along with the toner, it disappeared! LOVELY product!"
"Amazing product! My acne has completely cleared up over a weeks time. Which i have literally taken and used everything to diets,products,dermatologists,and to medication. It feels so good when i cleanse my skin it is an icy clean feeling. I use this with the charcoal cleanser and its just the perfect two! BUT if your have dry skin i don't suggest using this it is a little drying. I have oily oily oily skin and i have not gotten oily at all."
"Great cleanser! Great cleanser for a drug store brand! Cleans very well but does not over-dry, even when I use this to clean before my retin a gel. The only thing is, it foams a lot (too much when I use my clarisonic with it) but it still works so well and I love the scent and cooling sensation. The cooling is nice-noticeable but not too strong. My skin seems clearer and balanced when I use this. It has 2 sal acid. I'm almost 40 and still get blemishes. My skin has become drier with age (and my skincare regimen) but this reminds me of those anti acne anti aging cleansers at a fraction of the price. They are meant to clean, exfoliate, treat blemishes while not over-drying. This is one worth trying! I think it would be good for body acne too."
"excellent product I've been using this cleanser for 5+ years. I have moderate acne and this makes a huge difference as far as blackheads/whiteheads are concerned. The bottle lasts a long time, foams very nicely. It is fairly concentrated, so you don't need a lot. My face is oily and it keeps the oil down. Be careful when using it in combination with other acne products like benzoyl peroxide, it may be too drying and irritate your skin. However, I combine mine with a 10 sulfur mask I use daily, and it works great."
Great product Finally a product that clears my complexion
"PERFECT FOR ACNE PRONE SKIN I have been battling adult acne since I was 21, I never had it as a teenager and didnt understand why I was getting it now. I have tried oral antibiotics and every expensive cleanser out there and nothing helped. I started using this face wash about 3 weeks ago with DDF benzoyl peroxide gel with tea tree oil after and my face has been clearer than it has in years!! I also use eucerin oil free face lotion. These 3 are the perfect combination to fight adult acne!"
Best Acne Preventative EVER!!! Using this product for over six years by far the best product on the market for removing blemishes and keeping them away unfortunately not available anywhere and retail any longer why would corporate pull it from the shelves RIDICULOUS
Great product Great got this for my 14 year old daughter who was having a lot of break out cleared her skin right up
8325978315 This product is amazing it doesn't dry my skin of moisture.
Happy to find this again I have used the particular lotion for years. But it is nearly impossible to find in retail stores anymore. I am very happy to be able to order it directly from the company. This lotion does not have the bronzer in it so it does not make a mess on your swimwear and towel.
Amazing The only product that has managed to control my spot problem!
"Lost without it I've been using this product for a few years, it's the only thing that has worked on my acne, I'm now 30 and living in NZ and struggling to find it anywhere. I always stock up and clear the shelves when ever I find this wash"
Best easiest cleanser This is the only product that works to keep my skin clean and clear!
"AMAZING i have been using this product for at least 5 years and it is my STAPLE. keeps blemishes away. i have dry/combination skin, and this product is great at drying up oil, yet when combined with a light moisturizer gives you soft non greasy skin. haven't used a makeup wipe in years either. this wash gets off every bit of grime. 5 stars!!! please get this in target!!!!"
"Works as promised with no side affects! I have suffered with cystic acne since a teen. I am now in my 30's and it STILL works wonders! I pair it with the pore strips once a week and I never have any issues. People actually compliment me on my skin! I have 3 children, ages 16, 14, and 12. You better believe I buy this for them too!"
"Great Cleanser I have went through two full bottles of this cleanser(over some time of course) and I can say that this is one of the best cleansers I have tried. I very rarely ever repurchase cleansers because they just don't work for me. This one is a game changer though. After washing my face, my skin feels clean, soft, and my pores don't feel clogged. This product has definitely cleared up my acne. It's also fantastic at removing my stubborn makeup. Be careful not to get it in your eyes though!"
love it! I have been using this for ages. I used to use a really expensive one but I couldn't afford it anymore so I bought this and it really helps. It doesn't dry my skin out but it takes the oil away. I have really oily skin but it is also really dry and prone to break outs and I stopped using any creams or spots for a while but I have started to use this again and I only use it once a day and that is all I use and it has practically cleared my skin already.
"Controls Cystic Acne I have cystic acne, and this product has been my go to for 10 years. I use every morning and one week without using it, the break-outs will return. Make sure to moisturize after or else your skin will dry out!"
Great product! I just bought this a week ago and after just one use I saw a big reduction in the number of blackheads on my nose. Overall it made my skin really soft and smooth. Awesome everyday cleanser :)
"Biore Review Biore is my main fash wash, I was happy to find Walmart sold it online!"
"What a tan aide!! I have Native American blood and this lotion gives me the richest, golden, dark tan I have ever had. Plus my skin stays hydrated This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great product We have been using this for 2 years, no more acne or blemishes."
"Really works! I'm prone to breaking out often and this product really helped clear my face up! Bought it a month or so ago and us it every morning and night, I definitely see a difference!"
"Amazing Love this it's a must buy , you will not ever be sorry"
"Great product Great for sensitive skin, doesn't dry skin out or leave it oily."
Love this stuff I've been using this product for many years but now it's hard to find. Walmart and Target never have it anymore.
"best biore cleanser! Wish target would stock in stores again, could only buy online. Great product."
Awesome stuff I've been using this for years and can't find it in stores any more. I love this face wash - very refreshing and I hardly ever have any issues with my skin when I use it.
"THE ABSOLUTE BEST I have acne, not terrible acne or barely there acne. It is more like average. I also have VERY oily skin and black heads around my nose. Surprisingly, my face dries out with certain acne product. I bought Biore cleanser because of its reviews and Allure award I love Allure. I had been using Neutrogena Acne Cleanser Pink Grapefruit, Green Redness Soothing and the Original. The original worked best, but I was still unsatisfied. The pink grapefruit cleanser is drying out my skin and worsening my acne. I will definately go back to Biore! I felt the difference right away! Don't know why i stopped using it! Will never change!"
Refreshing Facewash This product worked amazing for my skin and it leaves you feeling really refreshed and has a cool feeling on face.

"GREAT STUFF !!! Just discovered this product. Will use as a year round total body moisturizer. Non greasy, goes on easy and just melts into your skin. The only draw back is that it has no availability in the traditional retail distribution channels."
"I AM IN LOVE! This is the best product ever! I am a HUGE fan now. I've tried many face washes, hoping to find the right one. My skin is stubborn to put it, some parts dry while others oily/broken out, and it's quite red.Very sensitive skin. After once use of this my skin was instantly softer, my pimples shrunk to where I barely saw them (as before was like 'BAM, look at me!') and no more redness. I was shocked. Normally after washing my face parts of it becomes instantly over dried, that I have to apply lotion. This product is my final answer. I am a huge fan and will continue to recomend it to anyone I talk to(: You won't regret buying this!"
Love this stuff It feels so zingy and refreshing! It might be a coincidence but my skin looks and feels better since I started using this a month or so ago.
"Great for sensitive skin I have sensitive skin, but not necessarily in the traditional definition of sensitive. As long as I have a routine and don't alter it, my skin is fine. The moment I introduce a new product that doesn't agree with my skin, that's when the sensitivity becomes an issue and I either experience a breakout, a patch of eczema, or both. This cleanser is gentle enough to not dry out my skin, but it also is effective enough to fight acne breakouts. I am 27 and I have PCOS, so I do suffer from occasional acne despite my age. This is less powerful than something designed for teenagers with a lot of acne, but not so gentle that it leaves oil on my face after use. Just right! I tried a few different products during a brief time when I could not find this product in stores, and nothing compared to it. I also enjoy the tingling feeling it leaves on my face. Don't stop making my face wash, Biore! My skin thanks you!"

"This product is terrible At first, this lip balm was OK. There was barely any moisture and not at all lasting. However, the longer I used it, it became drying. After a month of use, this product made my lips crack and dry for a whole week. It was disgusting and did not feel good. My lips felt like snake skin. I definitely do not recommend this product."
"Worse than cheap kid's lip balm. I bought this just to try thought it would be good. I used it for a week before tossing it. Within a couple days my lips were as if I was licking them constantly, dry and peeling. I used a different chapstick and they were healed a couple days later."
Australian gold I have been using Australian gold for several years and are very happy with the results.
"Very Sad!!! I would not want to say anything negative about this product, but I do it for advise other people or to see if the same things happens to them. I really wanted to try this product, but apparently contains some ingredients that also contains the EOS lip balms and gives me allergy in the lips. The first symptoms begin with itching and redness on the edge of the lips with just only 2 days of use. I guess is the beeswax that contains both products. I will give a try to A Kiss of Smoothness that doesn't contain beeswax. I hope this helps!!!"
Ewww This lip care tastes like you swallowed a bottle of perfume and its thick on your lips. Can't stand this stuff and wouldn't recommend it.
"DRIES MY LIPS So I bought this product assuming the whole 'milk and honey' would really do the trick. I mean, it really makes my lips soft and nice when i'm wearing it but as soon as it comes off my lips feel extremely dry and I have to keep putting it on."
"It's ok, but I am still searching.... I have some majorly chapped lips, so I try about everything.. this would probably be fine for most, but like I said.. still searching for something better."
Just average Smells nice but overall was just an average lipbalm. Did not moisturize the best and was pretty dull. Will not repurchase
the is very product good ! this product is very good ! after 2 days of use my lips felt smooth ! but the only thing i didnt like was the smell. i didnt very like it. it smelled like a chruch during a communion. i was expecting a honey like thing mixed with milk like my liquad soap i use. but overall its great ! :3
Great scent This stuff feels so good on the lips! The honey smells really good and it feels like butter except less greasy! It's very light which is a plus! You need to buy this!
Good product (except for the smell) I loved this product. It's super moisturizing. I liked it some much I used it up in a week. The only thing I don't like about it is the smell.
Very happy with my purchase This is my first time seeing this product so being a fan of honey to begin with i wanted to give this a try. I love the feeling on my lips. its not heavy at all but you know the product it there. its not goopy or tacky feeling either which is a BIG selling point to me. It kept my lips hydrated all day without looking I had a ton on product on. There is a light honey scent to this lip care which i don't mind. Overpowering scents are a deal breaker for me and im glad to say that im obsessed with this lip care. ive already recommended it to a few firends and co-workers.
"Really Does Soothe! I picked this up without a lot of thought solely based on the fact that it says soothing lip care right on the front. My lips were super chapped yesterday and had even bled a little where my lower lip had cracked. This balm definitely lives up to its name! Immediately my lips felt better, and today are almost completely smooth. I DEFINITELY recommend this product!"
"Love this lotion I have been using this lotion for several years, this past year I can't find it at my local stores. I buy intone cruise ships whence cruise. I use SPF4 and reapply often. I have not burned and get allowing tan."
Nivea Milk Honey Lip Care I've used Nivea Milk Honey for a few years now and I love it. It keeps my lips moist.
The best. I picked this up on accident after being hit with chapped lips and couldn't seem to find the cure. Let me just say now I brougt over 30 lip balms and this was the best. It's rich while also being light and moisturizes beautifully. I can wear a tinted lip balm over this and it's amazing.
Probably my favorite chapstick! :) The kiss of milk and honey chapstick went on SO smooth and light on my lips. It brought a very nice feeling and lasted a while too. I've tried many other chapsticks and I always want to come back to this one. Other chapsticks go on too thick or taste too fruity but this one is perfect.
"worth your buy! I have tried NUMEROUS lip balms... going from Blistex, Burts Bees Wax, to the Eos products, but I have never had such amazing results from this lip balm within two days my lips were soft and looking healthier. I am definitely going to continue to purchase this product."
"Silky and smells amazing Love how it smells like honey, love it even more because it feels like honey on the lips. Very silky and glides on so effortlessly. Lasts for many hours too. And the yellow color of the product makes it so cute and fun to use. But don't worry it will not color your lips."
Great product All I have to say is walk arts shipping is truly terrible they delayed my package multiple times this product is amazing but my gosh was the shipping terrible
"Keeps my chapped lips hydrated. :My lips just feel better overall after applying this onto my lips. In this dry summer weather, my lips are prone to being dry and cracked. Now my lips feel softer and healthier. I will defiantly buy this again. Plus, it smells like honey :)"
I have tried numerous chapsticks and this is the best! I have full lips and they easily get chapped and cracked. I started using this on a whim and I have never found another chapstick as moisturizing and non-sticky as Nivea Milk Honey. I use it once and I'm set for the rest of the day!
"Perfect for Pregnancy and Beyond I came across Milk Honey earlier in my pregnancy, I continue to use is in my last trimester, and I know it will be my go-to product post pregnancy. It smells great, hydrates my lips, and the continued softness is amazing."
"I've got Kissable lips again!! I alway have very dry chapped lips, but after using Nivea A Kiss of Milk Honey, I won't use anything else again!! My lips feel so smooth and no peeling. I love the scent too!!! Now I'm ready to be kissed!!!"
Awesome product! Use it every year for years now as sunscreen. Love it!
omg!!!! thank you TO THE PERSON WHO CREATED THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i used this becuase i have lips that dry extremly easily and bleed. i have not had that problem since i have used this. i recomended this to my freinds who have the same problem and they LOVE it as well.
great lip balm!! I have used the regular Nivea lip balm and been satisfied. However this one caught my attention. I really like the light scent/flavor. My lips feel very soft healthy. I use it daily and am quite pleased.
"Does what it says! This is one of the only lip balms that I've found that actually works. It definitely relieves dry, chapped lips within a few days of use."
"first lip care i never have tried this is the first one i have tried and i love it i will never go back to everything i used before this, i love the feel and Smell of the honey and milk and it feels so!! good n my lips."
"keeps my lips soooooo soft I have been using this lip balm for about two days now and I am totally in love, it keeps my lips sooooo soft and I just can never get enough of it the only down side Is the smell of it."
"new fav 3 I loved it , it left my lips feeling amazingly soft ! It has a light scent of honey and leaves your lips feeling full and smooth . Great on the go or just an everyday lip balm ."
I would recommend It makes my lips really moisturized and it's easy to put on 333
Love em Always been a fan of Nivea Lips and these are my fav!
"First Nivea Lip Product One of the best lip products I have ever used! Saved my lips when it seemed like nothing else would. Smells amazing, and works like a charm!"
Better than expected... I thought this would be like a lot of beeswax and overly rich. My mom also loves this product. It looks great with my lip gloss too.
"Very Good Product! Organic,love the scent,non-greasy and it works!"
WONDERFUL!! most lip balm bothers me it feels like it is caked on and leaves my lips worse..this one is amazing i will never use anything else!
"I love it It feels soft, has nice scent, it's delicious and it really moisturizes.It is a great buy and I would recommend it for sure :)"
"Finished my 1st tube, on to the next. Moist and rich. Only tube I finished in my life!!!"
great moisturizer I have been so pleased with this product! It has a great flavor and is such great protection for your lips! I love this product!
GOOD LIP BALM!! Makes the lips feel good and rich with moisture!! Last a few hours and take a long time for the tube to empty.
Absolutely fantastic! I absolutely love this lip balm! I have used loads of different lip balms and this is BY FAR the best!
AMAZING This lip balm is soo moisturizing.Its one of my FAVORITE lip balms. I LOVE ITTTT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Soft lips I love it and its my favorite. Wake up looking for it and i sleep with it on my lips, just in case."
LOVE THIS! Works so well and smells AMAZING. Favorite lip balm so far.
love this Milk and Honey Soothing Lip Care is really good.well hydrated and healthy looking lip
Just what I was looking for I love how it's not greasy like other sun screen products. I will continue to buy this product for sure.
AMAZING this lip balm is the bom. you can barly feel it on your lips. it lasts for hours
This product is amazing. A Kiss of Milk and Honey helps to soothe dry chapped lips. I absolutley love it.
I love it! Fantastic!! I love it and I look forward to buying different flavors :)
great product The absolute best lip care product I have ever used! This is amazing.
the best i love this! it moistzures my lips and keeps them unchapped.
love it the best thing to use on my lips. period. love it!
"Excellent love the way it leave my lips, so smooth and soft."
My all time FAVORITE lip balm! II'm IN LOVE WITH THIS LIP BALM! I noticed my old lip balm wasn't doing much for my lips. I decided to try this out because of the scent. It's not too strong so it will work for people who are sensitive to strong scents. It also works VERY QUICKLY to sooth and moisturize chapped lips. It's pretty rich but it has a very lightweight formula. This is the PERFECT lip balm for me. I'll never use anything else. My lips have never been smoother. This also works great for a lip primer! Just make sure to rub it into your lips first.
"It's a dry heat (inside) part II I bought two Nivea lip products. The coral lip care/balm/tint and Kiss of Milk and Honey. This is a wonderful product--the description is accurate. All the above and more. It isn't fragrant unless I'm missing something I don't mind--it's gentle and soft. Luscious and more then a soda pop flavored lip balm. A real soother for dry lips--mine are just shy of chapped. Then there's the text book of whacky weather.Warm,cold,humid,whipping wind then freezing again.It's dry in the house and debatable outside. Lip products(all varieties) are becoming empty display shelves. So glad I bought and tried this product. It looks glamorous next to the humidifier and the big gulp of water. Thanks!"
"I love everything about it My lips tend to dry out very easily and most other sticks or balms I've tried over the years just don't do anything for me. Instead of moisturizing my lips they just leave a heavy, waxy residue that eventually congeals into a white film that I have to awkwardly wipe off. Yeah, not a pretty sight. But the other day I saw this in the store by chance. I like milk, I like honey, and there were only two tubes left on the shelf so I figured it was worth a try. I'm a guy so I didn't want something that would be overly fragrant or glossy, and I couldn't be more pleased with this. The scent and flavor of milk and honey is very subtle (yet delicious!) and it is light enough so it doesn't leave any sort of sheen or residue. After a week of use my lips are noticeably softer, healthier, and more hydrated. The only downside is that it softens up very quickly in my pocket due to body heat and it makes me worry about it melting in the warmer summer months. For women with purses that shouldn't be a problem. Other than that I love the product and I will continue to buy it as long as Nivea continues to make it! (Hint hint- please never discontinue it, I beg of you!)"
Missing cocoa Miss the shade cocoa! Bring it back. None other compares.
Best lip balm I've found I've used this product for years. It's fantastic. Not much else to say.
Taste great Excellent for a change
"Best Lip Balm Ever Being a girl I have tried a TON of different lip balms, but none are as pleasant as Nivea. The two main attractions for me are the taste and how well it moisturizes. It has a light scent and little to no flavor, so whenever I lick my lips my mouth doesn't fill with an overwhelmingly nasty flavor, as experienced with other brands like Lacura and Blistex. Also, for the past two years that I have been addicted to Nivea, my lips have never once pealed or cracked, as experienced with Chapstick. It is a very light lip balm too, so it never feels like there is oozy sticky stuff on your lips. I definitely recommend this stuff because it is AMAZING."
The best Nivea lip balm A Kiss Of Milk And Honey Soothing Lip Care is the best lip balm I have ever used. It's surprising how different the Nivea Lip Balm Sticks are from each other. Milk and Honey has no irritating ingredients for my very sensitive lips and surrounding area. Moisture rich! Slight sheen! I use this under all other lip products. *I use Nivea a Kiss Of Smoothness with the SPF when sun bathing but I find it drying and irritating. I should mention I have sensitivities to chemical sunscreen so I'm pretty sure that's the reason.
"Perfection My lips are frequently chapped and cracked, and I have tried many lip productions and they typically do not help for the long-term (for more than the first 20 minutes you have it on). This product has helped so much! It goes on nicely, provides a nice not-too-flashy shine and no scent/taste/color. I've noticed that since I began using this, my lips have improved for the long-term, so by the end of the day they are still smooth. I've bought several more tubes to leave in various bags and pockets because I love it so much!"
I love this lip balm !! My lips were always chapped or very dry . I was drinking water like crazy to hydrate . But my lips just wasn't getting better . I saw this lip balm and decided to try it . My lips were better I'd say in 3 days after using this . I now use it before heading to work and at bedtime . It's nice feeling lip balm . Not a heavy waxy feeling . This is the first lip balm I have used all the way to the bottom . It's great !!
"Best Lip Care I've Tried! Goes on smooth and stays on overnight. My lips chap easily and then peel and get sore if I don't use some sort of balm. This one is the best one I've found. When I put it on at bedtime my lips are smooth and moisturized the next morning, and stay that way all day. It isn't sticky or oily. I definitely will keep this on hand at all times."
"I love this stuff! I bought this on Sunday because I have tried the kiss of smoothness and loved it. So I thought lets try something different. Well, to my surprise I like this one much better simply because it moisturizes my dry winter lips a touch better then the K.O.S. (which works well in the summer) I dont have to reapply as often as other name brand chapsticks. Over all they are both great!! I say try them all!!!"
One of My Favorites Keeps lips smooth and moisturized without the over greasy feel. I will purchase this again and again. please don't change anything!
"This product is definitely worth purchasing!!! Here in the Caribbean, the temperature can get very hot. This lipbalm has helped with my chapped lips and since I work in an air conditioned environment, it helps to keep my lips moisturized. It also has a very fruity scent and it isn't greasy. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to see results. I have also purchased Nivea's A Kiss of Smoothness and can't wait to try it."
"Can't find my favorite color I LOVE this product but, sadly can't buy it anymore because you've discontinued my favorite colors--papaya and cocoa. Darn!"
"I absolutely love this product!! I have been using Nivea Milk and Honey Lip care for about 2 years. When seasons changed my lips would get so bad, blistered, burnt, and chapped all at once. I have tried many other products but nothing worked. I happened to just pick up Nivea just to see if it works and I haven't put it down since. IT IS THE ONLY PRODUCT I USE ON MY LIPS!!!!"
Nivea A Kiss of Milk and Honey Soothing Lip Care is a MUST have! I LOVE this product! I tell all my friends about how great it is! It has a really nice scent and when you put it on your lips its like butter. Its sooooo smooth! I use it every day and all day. Its made my lips so soft. No more winter dry lips. If you love your lips treat yourself and buy this lip balm. You will thank yourself! I give it 5 stars and thats only because I cant give it 10!
"Perfect Balm Amazing is the only word I can describe this balm with. Most lip balms left my lips feeling slick, greasy, and I kept having to reapply every half hour. This is the perfect lip balm. I keeps my lips moisturized for hours at a time and the smell is not overbearing in the least. This is definitely a holy grail in my everyday make-up routine."

wonderful deep moisturizer I started using this moisturizer when my sister told me about it. I could feel my dry skin softening over a few days. It didn't hurt when I smiled! That alone was a good reason to try it. Now I will even smile deliberately. It is a good feeling to to able to show I am not a grump!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"BRING BACK COCOA!!! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE bring back cocoa! I've wasted 50.00 or more trying these other colors. They don't work for me."
Please Bring Cocoa Back! This was MY shade of lipstick. I wore it all day every day and all night. PLease please please bring it back!!!!!!!
Bring back COCOA This is by far the best shade out of all of them! We want it back Please please restock!! I gave them all to my friends once upon a time and they all have it.
"...problem I tried this for the first time, and loved the look, but after a half hour or so, my lip started to swell.. it wasn't pleasant. my roommate had the same experience."
"Hello bring cocoa back Cocoa was my fav lip gloss! I understand if ur not making enough sales that u take it out of the stores, but to discontinue it that was just wrong!!!! People will buy it online!"
"No CORAL/PEACH/COPPER shades I can't believe NUTMEG PAPAYA have been discontinued with no replacements! Your lip shimmer colors are INCOMPLETE without a coral,peach or copper color. I used to buy 3 at a time because they were always sold out."
Minus cocoa. minus me Until you bring back Cocoa.. You are minus a customer. This was my all time favorite shade and I haven't found another like it. I am not the only one. Read ALL the reviews....Why take away a good product that people love
"Please bring back Cocoa Lip Shimmer As so many other reviewers have said, Cocoa was a really nice lip color, and now you've discontinued it. I'm so disappointed. Your other colors aren't right for me, so now I'm an ex-customer. I hope you'll reconsider your decision and bring back Cocoa."
Need cocoa!!! I have been using cocoa lip tint for years and could not find it in the store any more so my friend who also has used the color for years said she had recently got it online. So sad when I saw that it was no longer here! What am I going to carry in my pockets for dry lips Bring it back!!!
COCOA -- PLEASE As per many of the other reviews -- PLEASE BRING BACK COCOA. I've used this shade for over 7 years -- I have never had a lipstick that works as well as COCOA. It's the best!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring it back. I've tried other Burt's Bees shades -- but nothing looks as good as COCOA. 1 Star -- only because there is no COCOA.
"Like it a lot. I've tried many products including the over priced products claiming to work miracles. This product I like. It sinks into the skin and doesn't leave a shine. I would recommend it. I'll buy it again and since I like this product so much, I'm going to try some of their others in this line."
"Bring back COCOA!! I used to love your lip shimmers, I even opted to use the cocoa lip shimmer for my wedding, paired with all the expensive make-up I bought for the special occasion. I am very disappointed to discover after periodically looking in different stores for months (years), that you have discontinued your cocoa color. I have bought two other colors in attempt to replace my last cocoa, but they look just awful on me. Please (PLEASE PLEASE!!) bring back cocoa!!"
"Bring back old Rhubarb color! The Rhubarb lip shimmer was my favorite and I used to be able to wear it with everything. This summer I went to buy more of it and noticed that the color of the cap was different than the one I was using. I bought it and brought it home, and the shade is definitely not the same - it is darker and more pink. It feels a little more waxy also. I am so disappointed! I am wondering why you would change the color and/or formula if this is your best seller"
"Broke on first try Burt's bees doesn't usually disappoint, but this product left me sourly disappointed. While the color and product are probably good, I'll never know because the container was poorly made. The turning dial at the bottom could bring the product up but it would't bring it back down. I was left with this large stick of product just hanging out and a huge mess. I seriously hope they'll accept a return because I wasted my money on this product."
"Totally disappointed I have almost every Burts Bees color of lip shimmer, and I'm only luke warm happy with a couple of them of them. Many of them I hate (and give away to a friend). But COCOA is my favorite lip color of all time--across every brand of lip stick. And Burts Bees has discontinued it the new colors to replace it are completely awful looking on me and now I'm completely out of cocoa lip shimmer. If you don't bring back cocoa lip shimmer soon, you've completely and forever lost a customer. Promise."
"On the Cocoa bandwagon Usually, I pass on registering on sites, but if it will help bring back Cocoa Lip Shimmer, it will have been time well spent. It was my go-to lip product for years and I'm sparingly using the last of it. The same applies to a friend of mine. Both of us are dismayed and none of the other colors is just right. I selected 1 star to reflect my disappointment, but it would have been a 5 if the perfect color for me, and obviously others, hadn't been eliminated. Please bring Cocoa back!"
"BRING BACK COCOA I have been purchasing the cocoa lip shimmer for as long as I can remember. I regularly have 5 or more of these floating around purses, make up bags, my desk at work, my car, everywhere. I was so upset to hear that this color has been discontinued. I know several girls at the office use this product too and we joke about how much we Rely on it. Please bring back cocoa. I attempted the plum tonight and hate it . . . fig isn't good either. I am very disappointed in ending a product that was loved by so many."
"What happened to Merlot! I just found out that Merlot is discontinued! Terrible news! I also read several reviews on Cocoa, which was apparently discontinued and brought back. I think the same should be done with Merlot. I checked on ebay and people are selling it for outrageous prices, which is an indicator that there are lots of other folks who feel like me! Please bring it back! It was the perfect shade of red, and you don't have other reds now...only pinks, browns, but nothing that dark. Loved it!"
"Please Bring Back Cocoa No, I can't recommend this product to a friend because it no longer is available. I can't give it a 5 star excellent rating either, because I can no longer purchase the product. I just returned home after searching several stores for my favorite lip gloss. To my dismay I discovered that the shade Cocoa has been discontinued. Why It's the best color for me. I've been using it for years. I also see that there are many more like me that want you to bring back Cocoa. Not even one of the other shades work for me. Please, I hope you are listening."
"Old Formula was SO much better!! I recently bought two tubes of lip shimmer. I LOVE the lip shimmer I had in the past. HOWEVER, the new formulation is NOT GOOD!! I applied the lip shimmer and realized that it was totally rancid. I looked at the ingredients and see that they've changed the formulation to include soy oil and canola oil....both of these oils go rancid VERY quickly and actually promote free radical damage because they are unstable oils. I am returning the two tubes immediately. Burts Bees.....PLEASE return to the previous formula. Rancid oils are no good!!"
"I with the rest of the group! I do not normally do this sort of thing, but once I logged in and saw the other comments, I decided I should have my say also. I hate lipstick-I hate the way it feels and I hate the ingredients. The only product I like to use is the Lip Shimmer, and it is a fantastic product-one that I have introduced many people to over the years! Like a lot of the other folks on here, COCOA is the only shade that works with my skin tone-all of the others are too light or orange-y. We are not all as fortunate as the reviewer in Hawaii that can use any of the colors! I am devastated that COCOA is no longer available, devastated I tell you. I cannot find any other color close to this and have even tried mixing two colors, but nothing seems to work. Which means, I have had to stop using this product all together and that just makes me sad. I have used BB products for years and now I am a little disheartened by this-so, I hope that you do listen to your fans and bring our cocoa back. PLEASE"
"GREAT PRODUCT! This truly is a great product! It has a very clean smell, and it actually works for Fine Lines wrinkles"
"BRING BACK PAPAYA LIP SHIMMER The Lip Shimmers line is great. I have particularly been a fan of the Papaya color ever since I first saw it years ago. It is (was) a great color with bronze/brown tones that worked well for my tones. I got compliments all the time. Apparently Burt's Bees has elected to revamp these colors for no apparent reason, and all of these new colors are very pink toned. You will notice that all of the many, many complaints are from people who preferred bronze or brown tones who have been left behind by this change. I am at a loss to explain why this company would ignore such brand loyalty by changing these colors for essentially no reason, and while providing no acceptable substitute. Please reconsider this decision to provide only pink-toned Lip Shimmers, and bring back the bronze-toned ones, especially wonderful Papaya!"
"Stick goes up, but does not come down-4 tubes I am only giving one star, because of my wasted time. I bought the first tube at a drug store. Love the color on me (Plum). The next day, I rolled it up a little for more coverage and it would not roll back down. Went back to the drug store and returned it for a new tube. Tried it in the store and it rolled up a little and it rolled down. I left the store, got in my car, while driving, I went to apply...rolled it up, applied, then it would not roll down. So I made a u turn and went back to the store. This happened on 4 trips. DANG, FIX THE TUBES."
"MAKE HISTORY WITH COCOA I am sure if you advertised the return of Cocoa and set a release date, you would sell out that day! Can you imagine the publicity you could generate from the whole Cocoa following! All of the ad possibilities... Commercials with real women scrambling to buy it out... If the company has no plans to bring back Cocoa at this time, then maybe they should fire the marketing department and hire me. The new shades do not compare to the old ones as evidenced by your own customer forum. I would not recommend the new shades to anyone. They don't even compare to the old ones."
Ruined the colors Bring back the old rhubarb - the new tone is too red.
not too great didn't like the texture nor the toffee shade. it felt like i was wearing saran wrap on my lips.
Short lasting I love the colors and goes on smooth and even. Unfortunately it doesn't stay on long. Comes on even without eating or drinking. Seems to rub off with speaking.
To shimmery! It was too shimmery and made me feel like I was wearing a child's chapstick. The color was fine but if the sparkle was toned down I would have no problems with it.
"hmmmm my husband bought one for me because he know how much i love those products. Well i hate it !! it makes my lips totally dry, and the color is way too intense, for sure it stayed too long..."
Nice shimmer but... I do very much love how this product adds a shimmery look to my lips... it's just that I find it to be too sticky! I don't use it as often as I'd like for this reason. :(
"color-less Love the Lip Shimmer feel, but the color I bought (Grapefruit) didn't give me the light pink color I was after. Instead, my lips looked white and pasty. Had to throw it out."
Product smell good Because they have use some kind of good fragnense in that
"Poor color selection! I have used the cocoa lip shimmer for years and I love it, but it has been discontinued. I have tried several of the new colors but have wasted my money as none of these compare to the Cocoa. I know that Cocoa was a popular color because it was always out of stock. Hoping that Burt's Bee will bring back Cocoa soon!!!"
"This product stains skin I bought this product thinking I would love it because I love the clear regular burts bees, but this berry color easily comes off when you drink anything and if you accidentally get it on your skin around your lips good luck getting it off...it just makes your skin look irritated and red. Not my favorite unfortunately."
"What happened As a faithful user (and recommender) of the nutmeg lip shimmer for several years, I was pretty upset to find that my recent replacement was now sticky, with weak color, no feeling of peppermint, and didn't last. Did the recipe change (The label is the same.) Please say I can get the original quality back somehow."
"not great color i didn't care for the two colors that i purchased, which i think were guava + rhubarb. they went on like a colored soft chapstick lip balm and i guess i was hoping for more of a lipstick or lipgloss texture. sad to say that i won't be buying these again, although i like the natural ingredients. they were fairly expensive too, considering."
"Not for Dry Lips My lips tend to get dry easily and this product didn't effectively hydrate them. In fact, it highlighted the dry ridges on my lips in quite an unflattering way. It was fine appearance-wise if I had just exfoliated my lips, but dreadful otherwise. I ended up having to buy a different product. It's probably good for those with normal lips."
"Where have the good colors gone This was a great product, but now the colors my friends and I have used in the past are no longer available.We wasted a lot of time walking the aisles of many, many stores searching for our colors. Why do you do this We have tried several of your other colors and do not like them. I'm giving two stars because of your color choices. Please return to the colors such as Nutmeg and Toffee. My friends and I are currently using other products, but would return to Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer if you added the old colors back to your collection."
"Natural is not all fruits and veggies I used to be a big fan of Burts Bees, but have recently scrutinized the ingredients of every product I use.I am an avid make up fan with a medical and scientific research background. The ingredient carmine is actually acquired from killing a certain type of beetle. It is a pinkish/red dye which comes from this bug and we put it all over our face. Some people don't really care but I think it's a little icky. Carmine is also has other names, can't recall exactly, like Red 4 and some others. This information is easy to find. I think it's interesting that all of the fruit oils are given their pleasant names however carmine does not say beetle dye in parentheses next to the ingredient name. When I wore this lip shimmer prior to gaining this knowledge, I did enjoy the colors and the conditioning properties. Burt's Bees is a good company, but not as perfect as everyone believes. Better than many others. I have stopped using this product and the many others containing carmine from all brands, including Dior, MAC, Benefit, and countless others.Though it appears that the color radiance is lacking the beetle dye."
"too much pigment when I was a kid, I used to make lip color by grinding up blush and mixing it with lip balm. burt's lip shimmer reminds me of that. there is too much pigment and it sits on top of the lips. not very sheer. so the first application looks ok but if you want to re-apply it builds up and looks thick and uneven. merlot would have been the perfect color, but it was too pigment heavy -- you have to look in the mirror when you apply it. if they eased up on the pigment a little, it would be great. I prefer balms that look like a transparent berry stain, and this is not it. it's more like a dark lipstick. unfortunately, their ligher colors are no better. they're lighter, but they're still not sheer."
cocoa Please bring back that shade back. Very disappointed.
We miss COCOA NUTMEG! Please bring back COCOA for my mother-in law and NUTMEG for myself. We miss our favorite colors!!!!
"This product performs as advertised I have been very pleased with this product from Olay. It truly does moisturize my very dry skin. It is easy to dispense the product by just pressing on the top of the container, and dispenses just the right amount per press. I would recommend Regenerist Deep Hydration Cream to anyone who has dry skin like mine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Cocoa Please being cocoa back!! It's the only shade I wear!!! Make some more and I'm sure it will sell out!!
so-so its moisturizing smells good go's on smooth and feels great but I wish the colors lighter than watermelon had less sparkle.
Woe is me. The Rhubarb shade has changed. Why!! This was for me the perfect shade for a natural look but you have changed it! How Why Are there any old tubes left. Can I buy them
bummer I bought this and used it once. I thought it was gonig to be a LIGHT tint. So I got kinda a brown color. NO it looked like full on lipstick. Not my scene.
No COCOA very disappointed!!!! started buying your products be/ca Cocoa Lip Shimmer! Been to stores find out discontinued.Hm I have purchased both plum and fig- hoping.just used once they at the bottom of bag
"Great formula, terrible shade. I tried the champagne shade of this lip shimmer. I loved the way the lip balm feels and moisturizes, but the color is a little too light and shimmery. I think the plain tinted lip balms will be better suited to my needs."
"Crazy for Cocoa I am so bummed that the Cocoa Lip Shimmer has been discontinued. I lived on that. Unfortunately, that was the only color I liked (I've tried them all), so Burt's Bees has lost me as a customer unless they bring that one back. I'm so bummed. :("
"Lovely color, doesn't last I'm in love with Plum - the color is just gorgeous! Unfortunately, it fades fast! I have to reapply 3-4 times during the work day at my desk job :/ Wish the beautiful color stayed vibrant longer."
"Love the product, miss the color Burts Bees broke my heart when they discontinued the Cocoa Lip Shimmer color. This was my favorite lip product of all time. I put it on throughout the day, by itself or in combination with brighter shades of lipstick, and got so many compliments. None of the other colors work for me. Boo hoo!"
miss my color Coming from someone who never wore make-up. I finally found a lip product and color that I loved. Cocoa. Obviously I am not alone in wishing you would bring the color back. P.S. a friend of mine work also wore the same color and is also very disappointed that she can no longer find it anywhere. Please bring back Cocoa.
"Worth the money My family is on a very tight budget, so spending 20 for facial cream was a big chunk out of my grocery . But this is well worth it. My rapidly maturing skin is getting smoother. I still have my wrinkles, but they are not so pronounced. I will watch for sales coupons, this is one product that I will keep using."
Good as lip balm but not as a lipstick It was moisturizing just like the beewax lip balm. I did not particularly like it as a lipstick however. The soft and moisturizing nature of the lip shimmer makes it too delicate and soft to be used. It does not operate well as other lipstick as it sometimes get stuck inside the tube. I would rather just use the beewax lip balm instead.
"Meh I received two of these lip shimmers in a mystery grab bag, and frankly they weren't quite what I was expecting. They felt a lot more like a lipstick than a lip shimmer, and unless I really caked it on, it felt a little dry (Though that could be because my lips are very dry in general). My coloring is very pale, so I think I will stick with the Pomegranate Lip Balm so lip color doesn't overwhelm the rest of my face."
Where are Papaya and (a darker rust) can't rememb I am a strawberry blond with green eyes. I look great in Papaya and the next darker rust color that you used to carry. I had multiples of each color in many spots in my life. I have really missed you making colors available for those of us who do not look good in more cooler colors. Please bring back warmer medium dark shades. I love your products otherwise. I do w ish your twist tubes worked a little better.
"BRING BACK COCOA!! Please bring back Cocoa lip shimmer! This was my signature color, and I am so disappointed it has been discontinued. None of your current shades work. I used Cocoa for years and often bought several at a time, since the shade was always sold out. Don't understand why you would fix something that was not broken. I no longer use any of the lip shimmers, as I have not found another shade I like."
"Vick's Vapor Rub I like the texture color (Rhubarb) but what is with Burt's Bee's lip products Every one I have tried feels like I have Vick's Vapor Rub on. Peppermint oil, maybe Although my nose felt clearer wearing this ':-/ it is too much for me and I will have to hand this off to my daughter who loves all Burt's Bee's lip balm. It would also be nice if they would offer a lip balm with sunscreen."
"Love the scent, but... Love the scent and lip-feel of these products, but the colors are a bit garish on my pale skin. I tried several different colors hoping to find something that would look right on me, but to no avail. I love the concept of a tinted lip shimmer, but am dssapointed that the colors Burt's ended up with were so....bright. And I do wear dark lipstick. But these colors just didn't do it for me."
Where's Nutmeg I love your Lip Shimmer products. But I miss the color Nutmeg. It looked good on everyone and none of your new shades can replace it. If I combine Caramel and Fig they sort of look like Nutmeg. But I have to apply them in just the right order and amount. I shouldn't have to do that. And I shouldn't have to carry two colors with me all the time. PLEASE BRING BACK NUTMEG! I'M BEGGING YOU!

"Allergy problem I got this for my mom in merlot. I haven't tried it myself. She initially liked the color and the texture. But after a few days of use it seemed to dry up her lips and the skin around her lips was irritated and dry. She might not have tolerated one of the ingredients, or might be allergic to something (though she has no known allergy). She, unfortunately, had to stop using it and had a similar problem with the Radiance Lip Shimmer. I'm sure lots of other people have used it without any problems and like it a lot."
"Love the Product, not the Tube I'm glad to see that there are others out there who are experiencing the same thing as me. I love this product, have been wearing it instead of lipstick for years. I recommend it to all who admire my lip look. BUT, I never get to use the whole lip shimmer because the swivel mechanism stops working and there's so much product still left on the center stick. I phoned today and the gal told me I was the first to complain, but when I looked at the product reviews on this website there are others who ae experiencing the same thing and apparently they exchange the wonky device at the store. That must got tiresome. I guess I'll go to a beauty supply shop, buy an empty lip pot and try to salvage the product to use with a lip brush."
"Ambi soap I have used this soap for years and considered it Wal-Mart's best kept secret. I was so disappointed when they stopped carrying it in our store location. Was delighted to see I could get it online it ended up a blessing. I don't go to Wal-Mart as often so I'm saving money there (Sorry Walmart), delivery was prompt, I stockpiled and never left the house."
6623443094 It smell just amazing and feels great on my skin and leave it feeling so soft.
Cocoa is back!!! Thank you for brining this color back. I love it so
looks and feels great the tingly feeling is great. i always get fig and i love the color.
Love the moisture with a little color The color added to the lip balm formula is a great combination...
Good. Its like a 2 in 1. Chapstick and shimmer:) i love it!
My Favorite Lip Shimmer I love MERLOT shimmer! Bring it back soon! PLEASE!
"Love it! Adds just enough color-leaves my lips soft, doesn't smudge, lasts a while. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love this stuff! Nice selection of colors, and looks great, not too gaudy looking. Natural."
"New Formula! The formula changed because it used to have lead in it. I still like it, though!"
lip shimmer Merlot is a great color and as always lip shimmers provide great moisture
This a pretty good lip shimmer This lip shimmer stays on and comes in a wide variety of colors. I just don't like the scent.
i Love this product I'm a 52 year old with dry skin and really need a cream that can hydrate me. when i use this cream i actually feel like me skin is saying Ahhhh. i'm really glad i found the whole Regenerist line. The older i get the more i find i need more and more hydration so Thank you This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Nice shimmer Nice shimmer and moisturizing lip balm. Taste is okay, not as good as peppermint lip balm."
Great Lip Color It lasts about as long as lip balm and can be difficult to find the right color but is a great lip shimmer.
"Really nice I really like these lip shimmers, but I do wish they would stain a little better and last a little longer."
Good lip tint This has great color and it moisturizes. The only problem is that it didn't last as long as I had hoped.
Would Recommend I thought this product was ok. I really liked the color and the way it tingled. I just wish it would last longer.
"It's ok but it's not cocoa I am so disappointed that u dropped the cocoa - please, please bring it back - nothing else is quite like it!"
"love it, wish it lasted longer! great peppermint smell/taste and I love the subtle shimmer, I just wish that I wasn't applying it every 5 minutes!"
"good product for casual look This product is a good lip gloss replacement. It wasn't as thick as lip gloss, and the color was nice and sheer."
Love the color and shine Love the way the Burts Bees Lip shimmer makes my lips feel and look. I love that it gives that hint of color. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Pretty lip color This lip shimmer is smooth and full of moisture, without feeling sticky. And the color is great for every day wear. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"GREAT PRODUCT This cream is the best I have tried, it has reduced my wrinkles and dry skin,it goes on very smoothly and has also helped to make my skin more even toned, I love this product and would recommend it to everyone, for most skin problems they might have. The best ever This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Love it! This adds just the right amount of shimmer to my lips and feels great when it's on! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Please bring back cocoa Please bring back cocoa! It was the only color I can wear and otherwise I love this product. I can no longer use it!
"Stop Discontinuing the BEST colors!!!! PLEASE bring Cocoa back!!! I love the Lip Shimmer, but not one of the current colors works for me. Why discontinue such a favorite!!"
"Good Product I like the lip shimmer because it's pretty and doesn't dry out my lips. Though when it gets at all warm (in the tube), it melts a bit easy. Still a really good product though."
where did it go Please bring back the cocoa colored lip shimmer. I wear it while playing golf to protect my lips. Some of the other colors are too pink for me.
Great lip appeal The lip shimmers are great! They go on easily and travel well. Easy to take with you on the run. I almost always have one in my purse or diaper bag.
Lip Shimmer Reinstate cocoa lip shimmer - this is the only color I have worn for 4 years and miss it terribly. You could make a small fortune bringing it back!
PLEASE BRING COCOA BACK! I'm giving 4 stars only because I want Cocoa back. Not one of the other colors is even close. Love this product but want my favorite color again!!!
"BRING BACK COCOA I LOVE COCOA please bring it back!!!!! It is my favorite color. The only lip balm I wear. Cannot find it in any stores. Please,please bring it back!!!!"
Love the Color! I love the raisin color! It is the perfect tint of red for me and does not feather throughout the day. The minty tingle and smell are a big plus :)
"deep hydration I use this at night and sometimes when I don't wear makeup during the day, I use it then too. Absorbs quickly, not sure now much it is actually helping me prevent more wrinkles, but smells good and feels good. not sticky. wish it worked even more against wrinkles. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"good tinted lip-stuff I use these and like them a lot. I tend to use the Burt's Bees regular lip-balm more often , but these are a great product for those that want a little color."
"Lip Shimmer is GREAT, but please bring back Nutmeg I am a fan of Lip Shimmer, but please bring back Nutmeg! It's one of the deeper shades without being purple. And it goes well with some of our skin tones."
"Great Product I love this product. The color, however, was a poor decision on my part. It is too pink for me, but it does stay on long and moisturize for a long time."
"i love all the diffrent flavors i love how the lip shimmer has so many different flavors to chose from. when i wear it, it looks good and it leaves my lips moisturize for a few hours."
"why have you discontinued cocoa Like many others I see, I love the cocoa shade and no other shade you have comes close. I am really bummed out to see you have discontinued it. Please bring it back!!!"
"Bring cocoa back, please Cocoa is my favorite color. I have searched several stores for this color to no avail. My original tube is gone. Have tried other colors, but do not like them as well."
Nice Product I like that this product is natural. It feels nice on my lips and I especially like the watermelon color. The drawback is that it comes off when I drink or eat.
Bring back Cocoa So disappointed that Cocoa is discontinued. Haven't found a lip shimmer color I like to replace it. All are too red or pink. Hope you will consider bringing it back.
Great replacement for expensive lipsticks! I love this stuff-- though it doesn't leave lips feeling as refreshing as the original. I wore the pomegranate one on my wedding day as a more natural color look. It was fantastic!
"A Hint Of Color This is a great everyday lip balm with just a hint of color. I have it in Champagne and Rhubarb. The Champagne was a little too pale and sparkly for my taste, but I love the Rhubarb."
"Read the ingredients' list My overall opinion - it is a great cream if you do not have comedones or acne because one of the top ingredients is Dimethicone - a silicone based polymer. It is large molecule and may clog your pores, therefore the condition of your skin will get worse This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Great Color The Plum shade is my favorite. It has fantastic color that goes with almost everything I own, and it is incredibly moisturizing. I do wish that it was a little more resilient though. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Color Change Raisin formula changed so the color is lighter and brighter which I don't care for. Prefer the darker, richer previous Raisin color. But I like the tingle/massage from the peppermint."
Good product I really like this product. It feels great going on your lips and comes in a wide range of colors. My favorite is Raisin. My only complaint is that I have to reapply it a lot.
"Toffee color I used my last Toffee color lip shimmer awhile back...can't find it anymore. Guess they did away with it also, like they did Cocoa I used Toffee and Champagne all the time."
Nutmeg Oh please bring back nutmeg! I have been looking forever. Is there any color you offer at this time that is close or possibly the same color with a different name : (
"Bring Cocoa Back PLEASE!!! I agree with so many reviewers here. This is my favorite every day lip color, but Cocoa was by far the best shade. Please, oh please bring it back ASAP as I'm out!!!"
"Great Color! I'm not one who likes bright colors, so I bought the Caramel shade of this. It's terrific! It gives me just a bit of color, lots of shimmer - and it looks natural."
"cocoa lip shimmer I like burts bees products, but my color was discontinued! it was the only color I liked was the only one that didn't contain apricot kernel oil (which makes me itchy). please bring it back!"
"disappointing Why do you keep taking away all the great brown family, cacoa. coffee. your other colors are just to red,cacoa was the perfect shade for the ladies who love the brown family.bring it back please."
Nutmeg I miss Nutmeg! It was the perfect shade to brighten up my face without using alot of blusher. Now it is gone and nothing has really replaced it adequately. I don't want to go back to lipstick. Please bring Nutmeg back.
Wth Very good product my mom uses it all the time when she loves it very much swears by it
"I miss Cocoa! I am so disappointed that the Cocoa Lip Shimmer has been discontinued. I haven't been able to find any small, keep-it-in-your-pocket lip color that I like. Please bring Cocoa back! You're losing me, Burt :("
Merlot - lip shimmer I love these lip shimmers. They have a mintu taste and moisturize lips well. Some of the colors rub and end up on front teeth. The merlot is the reddest of the reds and I just love theis color.
"Yummy! Love the way this product looks, feels, and tastes on my lips. Also, the color, fig, is really neutral with just the right amount of color and shine. Love it! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Looks great! My lips get very dry, so wearing lipstick is not the best for me. I tried this lip shimmer in plum. I love the way it looks! My lips dont get chapped from it. I'm very happy with this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Fun alternative to lipstick I'm not comfortable wearing makeup, but lip shimmer is a great alternative to lipstick when you want a little bit of color and a bit of fun. It absorbs well, so no sticky feeling left, and a little bit goes a long way. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"BRING BACK PAPAYA COCOA lip shimmers I LOVE PAPAYA, and have used it for 5+years. WHY DID IT GET DISCONTINUED. For us warm undertoned ladies, papaya and cocoa are the best for us. Your other colors are too pink or red. PLEASE BRING BACK PAPAYA AND COCOA."
"Love it I love this stuff. The color selection is good, the moisturization is great, and, while it doesn't last nearly as long as lipstick, it lasts way longer than gloss. The taste and texture are also infinitely better than normal lipstick."
"Missing Nutmeg I have been using your Nutmeg Lip Shimmer for several years love it, but can't find it anymore. Has it been discontinued I like the product so much and that color is the only one that works for me. Hoping you'll bring it back!"
"Where or where did my Nutmeg go No current color you have in Lip Shimmer compares to Nutmeg. My gal friends all love it and want it back....pronto....Why change a color that everyone loves I have been looking everywhere for it, now I know why I can't find it."
"Lovely I purchased the Peony shade. I'm very fair skinned, but it is flattering. I love the minty flavor and the pretty sheen. I feel like I reapply this more than other glosses, but enjoy the look enough to bear the burden of reapplication."
it feels great. not greasy. This product feels great and not greasy. I noticed less visible lines
"what happened to cocoa I join others to say please bring cocoa back. I am so surprised and disappointed that you don't offer it anymore. It's a great color...very classy, not bright and garish like some. Please return cocoa...it is the only color I like."
"Nice shimmer This gives just a touch of color. I could live without the strong peppermint tingling. It bothers my sensitive skin a bit. The color doesn't seem to last very long either, but it's very pretty and a nice option for on the go."
"An old favorite I first used these in middle school, and they are still a favorite to this day. In the winter, I recommend using a layer of Burt's classic balm underneath to help with hydration and to compliment the shimmers' peppermint flavor. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Nice color and lightweight I like the Lip Shimmer because it goes on smoothly and has a lightweight feel. The color isn't overwhelming, not too light or dark and the scent is pleasant. It also helps keep my lips soft. My favorite color is rhubarb. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Only lip color I wear I am admittedly not a big lipstick fan, but I do love the normal Burt's Bees chap stick and so this is a wonderful combination. I get the moisturizing and nice feeling of the chap stick and I get a touch of color without it being too harsh."
"Moderation is Key I bought this product in Champagne, and found it's a bit too light for my skin tone (light/medium with yellow undertones), so I only use it when I go out at night. The one downside is if I use too much, it ends up looking cakey on my lips."
"Nice, yet drying When wanting to add some color without all the chemicals I reach for this but! before I reach for this I reach for a balm to add moisture, because if my lips are not pre-moisturized they get dry after an hour or so of wearing lip shimmer"
"Love Lip Shimmers I only gave 4 stars as I thought the Cherry color could have been a tad darker but I still like it very much. The shimmers make your lips so soft. Great for running errands during the day when I don't want to wear lipstick. Keep the colors coming, Burt's!!!"
"Good, but... I like the lip shimmer and have it in a couple different colors, I just wish it didn't have the lipstick smell to it. I always feel like I am kissing my Grandma when I put this on. I do like it though, just enough color and the great Burts Bees tingle."
"Too Many Lip Shimmer Pink/Rose Tones I agree with the other writers about too many pink/rose shades and not enough peach/coppery ones. I can't find Papaya at all locally and haven't seen Nutmeg but bought both on-line. Burt's Bees, are you listening We want shades suitable for redheads."
"Very effective This product Works fine just like they advertised, i really love using it,"
"Love it, BUT... I love this product! It adds a perfect color while also feeling super nourishing on the lips! Only thing is... BRING BACK NUTMEG. My mom and I were avid Nutmeg users and we're both super bummed that it isn't sold in that color anymore! Still love this product, though!"
"lip shimmer cocoa I love Cocoa and they discontinued it. Why would they do that It was the best color and great ingredients. Can't live without it. I did buy the last 50 when it was closing out and am still looking for more in the stores that have left overs. Boo hoo, Susan J."
"lip shimmer i love the color, i bought fig and plum, they both look great on me. those colors have a subtle shimmer. the only problem is that the peppermint oil has a sort of weird feeling, but it's not too bad. u should check for allergies to peppermint oil before buying this"
"Coffee I loved coffee color. When this was discontinued, I went around all the stores around my area and internet and bought all available coffee lip shimmers. (You can guess how many I got... hehe) Please bring back coffee, pleeeeease!!"
Cocoa Lip Color What happen I need my Cocoa color. I have been using it for years. I am so upset. I can not find any other brand or color I like better then the cocoa. Please bring it back. Even if it's only available online for people to purchase.
"great product, however.... This is a very good lip shimmer, beautiful colors (so far I tried 3 of them), feels so good when you put it on your lips on hot summer day, it makes them feel cool. However.... with winter coming... I think I will switch to tinted lip balm, because of this cooling effect )"
"Lovely! Love the feel, love the lasting, love the color. Unfortunately the screw up/screw down fails in the screw down mode, so my tube is now somewhat messy. But it won't stop me from buying more, as I'm assuming that this particular tube is just defective. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Cocoa is my number one! I've tried 3 colors, but Cocoa is my number one color because it has great lasting power! It does fade away when I'm drinking or eating, but very nicely. I love the feeling when I apply it on my lips, very soothing with a hint of mint. I have olive skin and works really nice."
"Depends On The Color This product has a nice, subtle mint scent and taste. It soaks into lips and moisturizes well. While the deeper colors it comes in are very nice, I found that the color tended to wipe off and smudge into an uneven look. I recommend the color free, light shimmer shade called Radiance."
"BRING BACK THE TOFFEE AND COCOA I love this lip balm and have been a devoted buyer for 5 years. I am considering switching to something else because they don't make the only 2 colors I wear...Toffee and Coca. Both my sister and I love them, but we'll have to switch b/c no other color works...too pink/orange. PLEASE bring it back."
"not greasy! works nicely, evens out skin tone and doen't leaave a greasy feel.Will keep using! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Lip Shimmer I LOVE THIS PRODUCT but,,,,, PLEASE BRING BACK THE COCOA... I love that color and none of the other ones work for me. I was also using another color Toffee since I couldnt get Cocoa and you stop making that one too... PLEASE BRING THE COCOA BACK let me know when I can get it. Thanks,"
Lip balm with color! I got a 3 pack of this product as a gift. It came in 3 different colors. One of the colors did not look good on me so I gave it to a friend who loved it as much as I did. It's kind of like the lip balm that I love so much but with color. I love the clear one that just gives a simple shimmer.
"The best of both worlds Excellent for when you still want the bright freshness of the peppermint lip balms but also a little bit of color. These are grand in the cold weather months especially. It applies smoothly, with even color, and is rich and plentiful. Not quite as long-lasting as other lipsticks, but I still like it."
"Lovely natural color I really like Burts Bees Lip Shimmers. The lip shimmers have a nice natural color to them and a hint of shimmer that is very flattering and makes my lips pop! Since my skin is very fair, the colors are perfect and work well for me. On the down side, they are pricey compared to other brands of lip balm."
Feels good I love the way the lip shimmer feels - smooth and creamy - and I love the minty tingle. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the color of the toffee - it has a bit too much white in it. I find that I usually wear the BB super shiny lipgloss over it to tone down the whiteness and to add some shine.
"Bring back Cocoa! In agreement with 99 percent of these reviews, please bring back Cocoa! This was the perfect color for me and all other Burt's bees color have too much red pink or orange. I used to purchase these 5 or 6 at a time from my local drug store because it was always running out of stock it was so popular!"
Bring Back COCOA!!! I love the lip shimmers have several colors. I don't wear a lot of makeup like that I can feel like I'm wearing lip balm with the added boost of color. That being said I am very sad that I can't find my favorite color Cocoa anymore! That was my go to color for every day I bought 4 at a time! Please bring this beautiful shade back!!!
One of Two Burt's Bees Lip Shimmers are one of the only products I put on my lips. I have thrown out all of my other toxic lip colors and strictly use the Lip Shimmer: I am fair skinned and found a wide range of the colors look good on me. I alternate between: Champagne Guava Watermelon Rhubarb Raisin I can't wait to try Peony and Caramel!
Cocoa Lip Shimmer I never write comments but feel strongly with this one. I love your product but would like the cocoa reinstated. It is my favorite and was the only color I ever used. The Lip Shimmer is the one lip product I never leave home without. It is great at moisturizing without drying out or feeling sticky and the slight color is an added bonus!
"Nice color! I really like the way that the color looks on my lips- it's definitely a lip shimmer but it's a light color, not like lipstick. My only criticism of this product is that it feels a little scratchy when I apply it- it doesn't go on smoothly and it doesn't feel very creamy. It's nothing that would deter me from purchasing it though!"
"Hydration is REAL!! My Mom used Oil of Olay when I was younger and her skin was always beautiful. But I thought it was just natural. Then I tried the Regenerist and in a WEEK my skin was visibly softer, smoother and actually supple!! I CANNOT BELIEVE I have a soft face. You have to try this because if it made this drastic change in my rough, dry, peeling skin it will work on ANYONE!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Looks pretty while it lasts I got this in rhubarb, which doesn't sound good but it actually looks pretty. It's a nice color of deep pink- not too light, not too dark. It goes on sheer and smells and feels just like the plain original lip balm, which I loved. The only con that I came across is the color doesn't last very long. Overall, though, I really like it."
"Please bring back Nutmeg! Please bring back Nutmeg! I've worn Nutmeg for years - it's just the right balance of color without being too dark, too light or too red - it's perfect for my skin tone. I've got jeans with the outline of a lip shimmer faded into the pocket - it's always there! I've tried other colors, but nothing quite compares."
"Cocoa Curious I just purchased the Peony, and it has more of an orange hue than I would like. I seem to pick out alot of lip colors I have this same problem with. I'm looking for a natural tone to light pink tone without an orange tint, if anyone can help me It looks like Burts Bees should bring back this requested Cocoa!"
"Papaya and Nutmeg gone I have been purchasing the Lip Shimmers for many years and although I have tried just about every color, Papaya and Nutmeg go best with my skin color. Today, after searching 3 stores, I couldn't find them, so thought I would check your website. Gone for goodPlease, Please, Please at least bring Papaya back!"
Where did Coca go You sooo need to bring Coca back!!! I don't like wearing lipstick especially in the summer. Burt's Bees gave me an option of keeping my lips soft with color but they too Coca AWAY!! All of the 4 other different colors I have tired just look awful on me and it hasn't matter which season we are in. PLEASE PLEASE IT BACK!!!!
"Bring back Cocoa, please I ADORE this product. Over the years, I've tried MANY lipsticks. Never found one I like until I found the cocoa color of this product. Since it was discontinued, I've tried 5 other colors, none of which work for me. I would have rated this product 5 of 5, except that the color I came on the website to find is no longer made."
"Colors for pale skin What I love about Burt's Bee's lip shimmer is that it feels good on my lips--thanks to the peppermint oil--AND it looks pretty, too. The only thing is I have trouble finding colors that aren't too--for lack of a better term--pa-ZOW on my pale face. I do like Peony, though, and I want to try Guava and Champagne eventually."
"Great colors As with all Burt's Bees products, it's good to know that I can use this without worrying about toxic ingredients like parabens or pthalates. It comes in many great colors, so it's easy to find one that suits you. My favorites are peony, caramel and nutmeg. I also LOVE the minty feeling on my lips! Now if only it had spf."
"Bring back Cocoa! I am so disappointed that you have discontinued the color cocoa. I rarely like any lip colors, and cocoa was perfect for my complexion and personal style, too. None of the other colors look right or are flattering to me. I love what the lip shimmers do for the condition of my lips, but I won't be using them anymore unless cocoa becomes available again."
"nice light lip color i love these lip shimmes for keeping my lips moist and without that heavy lipstick feel and look. the color is definitely there, but not overwhelming and fake looking. wouldn't say they are long lasting. they stay on well as long you don't eat or drink, but are completely gone once you do. but that's ok, just reapply....they're made of natural ingredients!"
