Topological Properties of Multi Party Block chain Transactions Dong fang Zhao Department of Computer Science and Engineering The University of Nevada Reno NV United States zhao unr edu Abstract The cross block chain transaction remains one of the most challenging problems in block chains The root cause of the challenge lies in the non deterministic nature of block chains An party transaction across multiple block chains might be partially rolled back due to the potential forks in any of the participating block chains eventually only one fork will survive in the competition among miners While some effort has recently been made to developing hierarchically distributed commit protocols to make multi party transactions progress there is no systematic method to reason about the transaction outcome This paper tackles this problem from perspective of point set topology We construct multiple topological spaces for the transactions and block chain forks and show that these spaces are internally related through either home morphism or continuous functions Combined together these tools allow us to reason about the cross block chain transactions through the growing fork topology an intuitive representation of block chains Index Terms Block chains multi party transactions point set topology home morphism

Adversary Power Resistant Block chain harding Approach Yi bin Xu Jian hua Shao Yang yuHuan Ti sSl at and Boris udder Abstract Block chain harding is block chain performance enhancement approach By splitting block chain into several parallel run committees shards it helps increase transaction throughput reduce computational resources required and increase reward expectation for participants Recently several ex ib les harding methods that can tolerate upton Byzantine nodes security level have been proposed However these methods sue from three main drawbacks First in non harding block chain nodes can have die rent weight power or stake to create consensus and as such an adversary needs to control half of the overall weight in order to manipulate the system security level In block chains harding all nodes carry the same weight Thus it is only under the assumption that honest participants create as many nodes as they should that security level block chain harding reaches the security level Second when some nodes leave the system other nodes need to be reassigned frequently from shard to shard in order to maintain the security level This has an adverse eec on system performance Third while some approaches can maintain data integrity with upton Byzantine nodes their systems can halt with smaller number of Byzantine nodes In this paper we present security level block chains harding approach that does not require honest participants to create multiple nodes requires less node reassignment when some nodes leave the system and can prevent the system from halting Our experiments show that our new approach outperforms existing block chain harding approaches in terms of security transaction throughput and ex bil it Keywords Block chain Distributed Ledger Block chain Security Block chainS harding Block chain Performance

Mean Field Game Approach to Bitcoin Mining Charles Ber tucci Louis Ber tucci Jean Michel Las ry Pierre Louis Lions April Abstract We present an analysis of the Proof of Work consensus algorithm used on the Bitcoin block chain using Mean Field Game framework Using master equation we provide an equilibrium characterization of the total com put ional power devoted to mining the block chain hash rate From simple set ting we show how the master equation approach allows us to enrich the model by relaxing most of the simplifying assumptions The essential structure of the game is preserved across all the enrichment In deterministic settings the hash rate ultimately reaches steady state in which it increases at the rate of technological progress In stochastic settings there exists target for the hash rate for every possible random state As consequence we show that in equilibrium the security of the underlying block chain is either constant or ii increases with the demand for the underlying crypto currency MAP Ecole Polytechnique MR Palais eau France Institut Louis Bache lier Paris France Haas School of Business UC Berkeley Berkeley California Universit Paris Dauphine PS Research University MR CE REMADE Paris France Coll ge de France rue Ulm Paris France

ii cult in Controlling Block chain Mining Costs via Crypto puzzle ii cult VEN KATA SRI RAM SIDDH ARD NAD END LA Missouri University of Science and Technology LA VR VAR SH NEY University of Illinois Urbana Champaign Block chain systems often employ proof of work consensus protocols to validate and add transactions into hash chains These protocols stimulate competition among miners in solving crypto puzzles SHA hash computation in Bitcoin in exchange for monetary reward Here we model mining as an all pay auction where miners computational or ts are interpreted as bids and the allocation function is the probability of solving the crypto puzzle in single attempt with unit normalized computational capability Such an allocation function capture show block chain systems control the di cult of the crypto puzzle as function of miners computational abilities bids In an attempt to reduce mining costs we investigate designing mining auction mechanism which induces log it equilibrium amongst the miners with choice distributions that are unilaterally decreasing with costs at each miner We show it is impossible to design lenient allocation function that does this Spec ic ally we show that there exists no allocation function that discourages miners to bid higher costs at log it equilibrium if the rate of change of di cult with respect to each miners cost is bounded by the inverse of the sum of costs at all the miners MOTIVATION Permission less block chain systems including the Bitcoin crypto currency rely on proof of work consensus protocols that involve competitions among participants to solved cult computational problems crypto puzzles These participants called miners are bounded by the costs of resources needed for computation such as energy The consensus protocols however are subject to so called for king attacks attacks where miner or pool of miners having large fraction of the computation power in the system can asymptotically almost surely fork the block chain to prevent new transactions from being ve ried double spend coins or destroy the system via dramatic loss of conde ce As such an implicit assumption in ensuring the security of the distributed trust system is that there are large number of independent miners with incentives to follow the protocol In current practice though small number of participants perform the majority of mining often concentrated in locales such as in China where energy costs are low One can view mining as participating in an all pay auction where the bidding strategy captures heterogeneity amongst miners due to non identical computational abilities and diverse electricity costs at die rent geographic locations Recall that in an all pay auction the bid is for fei ted whether win or lose In Bitcoin mining involves computing the SHA hash function over and over as quickly as possible and so the bid can be thought of as the hash rate likewise in other block chain systems Equal hash rates bids incur varying costs to die rent miners depend in gon the basic cost of resources indie rent locales The Nash equilibrium strategies for all pay auctions under complete information are such that only the two strongest players lowest costs of bidding should actively participate and all others should bid zero this is exactly ac once ration of participants On the other hand there is over participation in many practical settings of all pay auctions where there are many more than two participants Several explanations for over bidding behavior have been suggested in the literature including bounded rationality and prospect theoretic explanations Even with rational agents over bidding behavior can emerge In the context of crowd sourcing contests previous work in designing auction systems has demonstrated that reducing information

An Algebraic Model For Quorum Systems Alex Pellegrini Luca Zan olin University of Bern University of Bern alex pellegrini in uni be ch luca zan olin in uni be ch Abstract Quorum systems are key mathematical abstraction in distributed fault tolerant computing for capturing trust assumptions quorum system is collection of subsets of all processes called quo rums with the property that each pair of quorums have an on empty intersection They can be found at the core of many reliable distributed systems such as cloud computing platforms distributed stor age systems and block chains In this paper we give new interpretation of quorum systems starting with classical majority based quorum systems and extending this to Byzantine quorum systems We propose an algebraic representation of the theory underlying quorum systems making use of mul ti variate polynomial ideals incorporating properties of these systems and studying their algebraic varieties To achieve this goal we will exploit properties of Boolean Gro bner bases The nice na ture of Boolean Gro bner bases allows us to avoid part of the combinatorial computations required to check consistency and availability of quorum systems Our results provide novel approach to test quorum systems properties from both algebraic and algorithmic perspectives

The Hermes FT for Block chains Mohammad Jalal zai Chen Feng Costas Busch Golden Richard III Jian yu Niu Abstract The performance of partially synchronous FT based consensus protocols is highly dependent on the primary node All participant nodes in the network are blocked until they receive proposal from the primary node to begin the consensus process Therefore an honest but slack node with limited bandwidth can adversely affect the performance when selected as primary Hermes decreases protocol dependency on the primary node and minimizes transmission delay induced by the slack primary while keeping low message complexity and latency Hermes achieves these performance improvements by relaxing strong FT agreement safety guarantees only for specific type of Byzantine faults also called equivocated faults Interestingly we show that in Hermes equivocating by Byzantine primary is unlikely expensive and ineffective Therefore the safety of Hermes is comparable to the general FT consensus We deployed and tested Hermes on Amazon EC instances In these tests Hermes performance was comparable to the state of the art FT protocol for block chains when the network size is large in the absence of slack nodes Whereas in the presence of slack nodes Hermes outperformed the state of the art FT protocol by more than in terms of throughput as well as in terms of latency Index Terms Block chains Byzantine Fault Tolerance Consensus Performance cal ability Security Throughput cid

Radium Improving Dynamic PoW Targeting George is si as ICS UMass Amherst gb is cs umass edu July Abstract Most PoW block chain protocols operate with simple mechanism whereby threshold is set for each block and miners generate block hashes until one of those values falls below the threshold Although largely ef fec ti ve this mechanism produces blocks at highly variable rate and also leaves block chain susceptible to chain death abandonment in the event that the threshold is set too high to attract any miners recent innovation called real time block rate targeting orR TT xe the sep rob lem by reducing the target throughout the mining interval RT exhibits much less variable block times and even features the ability to fully adjust the target after each block However as we show in this paper RT also sue rs from critical vulnerability whereby miners deviate form the pro to col to increase their prot We introduce the Radium protocol which mitigates this vulnerability in RT while retaining lower variance block times responsive target adjustment and lowering the risk of chain death We also show that Radium susceptibility to the double spend attack and orphaned blocks remains similar to Bitcoin

Performance Evaluation of Differential Privacy Mechanisms in Block chain based Smart Metering Mu neeb Ul Hassan Mu bashir Hus in Rehman and injun Chen The concept of differential privacy emerged as strong notion to protect database privacy in an un trusted environment Later on researchers proposed several variants of differential privacy in order to preserve privacy in certain other scenarios such as real time cyber physical systems Since then differential privacy has rigorously been applied to certain other domains which has the need of privacy preservation One such domain is decentralized block chain based smart metering in which smart meters acting as block chain nodes sent their real time data to grid utility databases for real time reporting This data is further used to carry out statistical tasks such as load forecasting demand response calculation etc However in case if any intruder gets access to this data it can leak privacy of smart meter users In this context differential privacy can be used to protect privacy of this data In this chapter we carry out comparison of four variants of differential privacy Laplace Gaussian Uniform and Geometric in block chain based smart metering scenario We test these variants on smart metering data and carry out their performance evaluation by varying different parameters Experimental outcomes shows at low privacy budget and at low reading sensitivity value these privacy preserving mechanisms provide high privacy by adding large amount of noise However among these four privacy preserving parameters Geometric parameters is more suitable for protecting high peak values and Laplace mechanism is more suitable for protecting low peak values at

Spam Prevention Using NARKs for Anonymous Peer to Peer Content Sharing Systems Alberto In sel in November Abstract Decentralized un permission ed peer to peer networks are inherently vulnerable to spam when they allow arbitrary participants to submit con tent to common public index or registry preventing this is di cult due to the absence of central arbitrator who can act as gate keeper For this reason indexing of new content even in otherwise decentralized networks Bittorrent with HT PFS has generally been left to centralized services such as torrent sites Decentralized methods for spam prevention such as Web of Trust already exist but they require submitters to assume pseudonym us identities and establish trust overtime In this paper we present method of spam prevention that works under the assumption that the participants are fully anonymous and do not want die rent submissions of their to be linked to each other By spam we do not spec ic ally mean unsolicited advertising rather it is the practice of adding large amount of content in short time saturating the capacity of the network and causing denial of service to peers The purpose of our solution is to prevent users from saturating the system and can be described as rate limiting The system should be censorship resistant it should not be possible for submissions to be excluded because of the content itself or for users to be excluded based on what they submit We rst discuss solution based on single centralized rate limit er that is censorship resistant and anonymous then we extend this to fully decentralized block chain based system and present methods to make it economical and scalable

Social Welfare Maximization Mechanism for Block chain Storage Yun shu Liu Zhi xuan Fang Man Hon Cheung Wei Cai and Jian wei Huang cid Abstract Miners in the block chain system are suffering from by the current block chain incentive mechanisms in the near the ever increasing storage costs which in general have not been future Note that miners storage costs are compensated by properly compensated by the users transaction fees In the long both the transaction fees and the block reward Currently the run this may lead to less participation of miners in the system and jeopardize the block chain security In this work we mitigate block reward accounts for the majority of miners revenues such block chain storage sustainability issue by proposing both in Bitcoin and there um which together with the social welfare maximization mechanism which encourages each transaction fees will be able to fully compensate storage user to pay ufc ent transaction fees for the storage costs and costs However as the block reward is designed to gradually consider the waiting time costs imposing on others We model decrease in many block chain systems Bitcoin to the interactions between the protocol designer users and miners give the crypto currency anti nation ary properties whether as three stage Stack el berg game In Stage the protocol designer optimizes the consensus parameters associated with the transaction fees alone are ufc ent to compensate the the transaction fee per byte values and waiting time costs to storage costs in the long run becomes critical issue As maximize the social welfare In Stage II the users decide the matter of fact there um average transaction fees in the rst transaction generation rates to maximize their payoffs In Stage half of is million per month much smaller than III the miners select the transactions and record them into the block chain to maximize their payoffs Through characterizing the aggregated monthly storage costs of all there um nodes the Nash equilibrium of the three stage game we nd that the storing the entire block chain more than nodes and protocol designer can not only achieve maximum social welfare monthly storage costs per node in Stage II and III of the model but also in centi viz each With the huge storage costs and in ufc ent transaction fees user pays ufc ent transaction fees for storage costs We also miners will have less incentive to stay in the system which nd that for users who generate transactions at lower rates they may pay higher waiting time price per transaction for jeopardizes block chain system security For example the num the waiting time costs they impose on other users there um ber of miners storing the there um block chain has declined based numerical results showed that our proposed mechanism since Such problem maybe catastrophic to the dominates the existing protocol in both social welfare and fees block chain in the long run With fewer miners the block chain achieves higher fairness index than the existing protocol and will be more vulnerable to single point of failure and performs well even under heterogeneous storage cost miners the whole system will be less decentralized becoming easier

On Chain Auctions with Deposits JAN CHRISTOPH SCHLEGEL City University of London United Kingdom AK AKIMA MAGE ISH VILI ETH Zurich Switzerland Second price auctions with deposits are frequently used in block chain environments An auction takes place on chain bidders deposit an amount that fully covers their bid but possibly exceeds it in smart contract The deposit is used as insurance against bidders not honoring their bid if they win The deposit but not the bid is publicly observed during the bidding phase of the auction The visibility of deposits can fundamentally change the strategic structure of the auction if bidding happens sequentially Bidding is costly since deposit are costly to make Thus deposits can be used as costly signal for high valuation This is the source of multiple inefficiencies To engage in costly signalling bidder who bids first and has high valuation will generally over deposit in equilibrium deposit more than he will bid If high valuations are likely there can moreover been try deterrence through high deposits bidder who bids first can deter subsequent bidders from entering the auction Pooling can happen in equilibrium where bidders of different valuations deposit the same amount The auction fails to allocate the item to the bidder with the highest valuation ACM Reference Format Jan Christoph Schlegel and Ak akiMa mage ish vili On Chain Auctions with Deposits June pages

Quantum Advantage on Proof of Work Dan Bard Joseph Kearney and Carlos Perez Delgado School of Computing University of Kent Canterbury Kent CT NF United Kingdom Proof of Work PoW is fundamental underlying technology behind most major block chain crypto currencies It has been previously pointed out that quantum devices provide computational advantage in performing PoW in the context of Bitcoin Here we make the case that this quantum advantage extends not only to all existing PoW mechanisms but to any possible Po Was well This has strong consequences regarding both quantum based attacks on the integrity of the entirety of the block chain as well as more legitimate uses of quantum computation for the purpose of mining Bitcoin and other crypto currencies For the rst case we estimate when these quantum attacks will become feasible for various crypto currencies and discuss the impact of such attacks For the latter we derive precise formula to calculate the economic incentive for switching to quantum based crypto currency miners Using this formula we analyze several test scenarios and conclude that investing in quantum hardware for crypto currency mining has the potential to payoff immensely

Collective intelligence and the block chain Technology communities and social experiments Andrea Baron chell City University of London Department of Mathematics London EC HB UK The Alan Turing Institute British Library Euston Road London NW DB UK UCL Centre for Block chain Technologies University College London London UK baron chell turing ac uk Block chains are still perceived chi ey as new technology But each block chain is also community and social experiment built around social consensus Here discuss three examples showing how collective intelligence can help threat or capitalize on block chain based ecosystems They concern the immutability of smart contracts code transparency and new forms of property The examples show that more research new norms and eventually laws are needed to manage the interaction between collective behaviour and the block chain technology Insights from researchers in collective intelligence can help society rise up to the challenge For most people block chain technology is about on chain consensus And it certainly is block chain provides users with method and incentives for validating and storing value or transaction without the need to trust central authority or any other participants in the system Once approved the transaction is recorded in an open ledger that cannot be altered retroactively Since the system is trust less everyone can join the network and read write or participate within the block chain in this article Iam considering only public and permission less block chains But public block chain is not self contained universe As socio technical system its life extents behind the user base For example block chain can provide competition to existent socio economic players and it is shaped by what users do with it and eventually by the law Continuous updates and strategic decisions are therefore required to keep up with such rapidly evolving landscape meaning that block chains are not self uci ent This has two implications The rst is that block chains need governance de ning how the community of users developers and immediate stakeholders can agree on how to make decisions The second implication is that in order for those decisions to be meaning ful the governing community needs to have clear understanding of the social experiment they have launched how norms and behaviours are impacting and will be impacted by the block chain itself Considering that each block chain is also community and social experiment is key to understand the evolution and impact of the technology Yet it is often overlooked both by block chain stakeholders who may be too absorbed by the technical aspects and by researchers who have traditionally been slow to detect societal transformation The latter is unfortunate since most data are public and the challenges raised by the block chain technology even just in the form of crypto currency have been increasing steadily Here focus on three examples showing what can happen when collective intelligence meets

Always on Voting Framework for Repetitive Voting on the Block chain arad Ven gopalan and Ivan Homo lia Abstract Elections are commonly repeated over longer and ed intervals of time ranging from months to years This results in limitations on governance since elected candidates or policies red if cult to remove before the next election eventhough they might be deemed detrimental to the majority of participants When new information is available participants may decide through public deliberation to make amendments to their choice but have no opportunity to change their vote before the next elections Another issue is the peak end effect where voters judgment is based on how they felt short time before the elections instead of judging the whole period of the governance Finally there exist few issues related to centralized voting such as censorship and tampering with the results and data To address these issues we propose Always on Voting oV repetitive block chain based voting framework that allows participants to continuously vote and change elected candidates or policies without having to wait for the next election Participants are permitted to privately change their vote at any point in time while the effect of their change is manifested at the end of each epoch whose duration is shorter than the time between two main elections To thwart the peak end effect issue in epochs the ends of epochs are randomized and made unpredictable While several block chain based voting proposals had been already presented to the best of our knowledge none of them addressed the issue of re voting and peak end effect Index Terms Block chain Security Voting Peak End Effect Privacy Veria ble Delay Function cid

Cross Referencing Method for Scalable Public Block chain Takaaki Yana ihara and Akihiro Fuji hara Department of Information and Communication Systems Engineering Chiba Institute of Technology Tsuda numa arashi no Chiba JAPAN Abstract We previously proposed across referencing method for enabling multiple peer to peer network domains to manage their own public block chains and periodically exchanging the state of the latest ed block in the block chain with hysteresis signatures among all the domains via an upper network layer In this study we evaluated the effectiveness of our method from three theoretical viewpoints decentralization cal ability and tamper resistance We show that the performance of the entire system can be improved be cause transactions and blocks are distributed only inside the domain We argue that the transaction processing capacity will increase to transactions per second which is as much as that of VISA credit card system The capacity is also evaluated by multiplying the number of domains by the average reduction in transaction processing time due to the increase in block size and reduction in the block generation time in ter val by domain partition For tamper resistance each domain has evidence of the hysteresis signatures of the other domains in the block chain We introduce two types of tamper resistance improvement ratios as evaluation measures of tamper resistance for block chain and theoretically explain how tamper resistance is improved using our cross referencing method With our method tamper resistance improves as the num ber of domains increases The proposed system of domains are times more tamper resistant than that of domains and the capacity is times higher Wec on clude that our method enables more scalable and tamper resistant public block chain balanced with decentralization Email address qq chiba kou dai jp akihiro fuji hara chiba kou dai jp Takaaki Yana ihara and Akihiro Fuji hara Pre print submitted to Else vier July

Decentralized Basic Income Creating Wealth with On ChainS taking and Fixed Rate Protocols Ha kwan Lau and Stephen Tse Center for Brain Science Riken Institute Japan Harmony ONE Correspondence ha kwan lau riken jp and harmony one Abstract In this review we evaluate the mechanisms behind the decentralized finance protocols for generating stable passive income Currently such savings interest rates can be as high as annually payable in traditional currency values such as US dollars Therefore one can benefit from the growth of the crypto currency markets with minimal exposure to their volatility risks We aim to explain the rationale behind these savings products in simple terms The key to this puzzle is that asset deposits in crypto currency ecosystems are of intrinsic economic value as they facilitate network consensus mechanisms and automated marketplaces for lending These functions create wealth for the participants and they provide unique advantages unavailable in traditional financial systems Our review speaks to the notion of decentralized basic income analogous to universal basic income but guaranteed by financial products on block chains instead of public policies We will go through their implementations of how savings can be channeled into the staking deposits in Proof of Stake PoS protocols through fixed rate lending protocols and staking derivative tokens there by exposing savers with minimal risks We will discuss potential pitfalls assess how these protocols may behave in market cycles as well as suggest areas for further research and development Background As of year the interest rates for savings in traditional fiat currencies such as the US dollar and the Japanese yen are at historic lows at around and respectively Because of the large national debts held by these major economies some may anticipate that interest rates may remain relatively low for the near future At low interest rates the traditionally lauded act of regular household savings becomes less rewarding This may have particularly strong impact on aging populations which rely on saved money as pension income for the long term sustenance of quality of life after retirement Meanwhile during the pandemic triggered by OVID major governments have printed large amounts of money to support their economic stimulation efforts This has led some to worry that inflation the rising of nominal prices of goods will eventually become inevitable Although modern economists

Testing the consistency of propagation between light and heavy cosmic ray nuclei Yu Wang Juan Wu and Wei Cheng Long School of Mathematics and Physics China University of Geosciences Wuhan China One of the fundamental issues in cosmic ray physics is to explain the nature of cosmic ray acc el ration and propagation mechanisms Thanks to the precise cosmic ray data measured by recent space experiments we are able to investigate the cosmic ray acceleration and propagation mod els more comprehensively and reliably In this paper we combine the secondary to primary ratios and the primary spectra measured by PAMELA AMS ACE CRIS and Voyager to constrain the cosmic ray source and transport parameters The study shows that the data yield high energy diu sion slope The species obtain looser constraint on The overlap infers the heavy and light particles can give compatible results at high energies Meanwhile at low energies sign cant disagreements exist between the heavy and light elements The ratio requires much larger diu sion slope variation around Vor stronger Alf ven velocity vA than the low mass data This indicates that the heavy and light parti cles may sue die rent low energy transport behaviors in Galaxy However better understanding on the consistency inconsistency between the heavy and light relies on more precise cross sections better constraints on correlations in systematic errors of data and more accurate description for Solar modulation during the reversal period of HM PAC numbers Keywords cosmic ray propagation acceleration

The Asymptotic Frequency of Stochastic Oscillators pre print Zachary Adams Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences Abstract We study stochastic perturbations of ODE with stable limit cycles referred to as stochastic oscillators and investigate the response of the asymptotic in time frequency of oscillations to changing noise amplitude Unlike previous studies we do not restrict our attention to the small noise limit and account for the fact that large deviation events may push the system out of its oscillator regime To do so we consider stochastic oscillators conditioned on their remaining in an oscillator regime for all time This leads us to use the theory of quasi ergo dic measures and de ne quasi asymptotic frequencies as conditional long time average frequencies We show that quasi asymptotic frequencies always exist though they may or may not be observable in practice Our discussion recovers previous results on stochastic oscillators in the literature In particular existing results imply that the asymptotic frequency of stochastic oscillator depends quadratically on the noise amplitude We describe scenario where this prediction holds though we also show that it is not true in general even for small noise Keywords Stochastic oscillators Isochron Quasi ergo dic measures

Some thoughts on catastrophic forgetting and how to learn an algorithm Miguel Ruiz Garcia Department of Mathematics Universidad Carlos III de Madrid Legan es Spain Dated August The work of McCloskey

McCloskey and Cohen and training on random examples one by one The neural network not only does not sue from catastrophic forgetting but it improves its predictive power on unseen pairs of numbers as

Distributed quantum phase sensing for arbitrary positive and negative weights Chang hun Oh Liang Jiang and Chang hyo up Lee Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering The University of Chicago Chicago Illinois USA Quantum Universe Center Korea Institute for Advanced Study Seoul Republic of Korea Dated August Estimation of global parameter de ned as weighted linear combination of unknown multiple parameters can be enhanced by using quantum resources Advantageous quantum strategies may vary depending on the weight distribution but have rarely been studied Here we propose distributed quantum phase sensing scheme using Gaussian states in order to take into account an arbitrary distribution of the weights with positive and negative signs The optimal estimation precision of the proposed scheme is derived and shown to be achievable by using squeezed states injected into linear beam splitter networks and performing homo dyne detection on them It is shown that entanglement of Gaussian states is advantageous only among the modes assigned with equal signs of the weights whereas is not useful between the modes with opposite weight signs We also provide deeper understanding of our ding by focusing on the two mode case in comparison with the cases using non Gaussian probe states We expect this work to motivate further studies on quantum enhanced distributed sensing schemes considering various types of physical parameters with an arbitrary weight distribution

Apportionment with Parity Constraints Claire Mathieu Victor Verdugo Abstract In the classic apportionment problem the goal is to decide how many seats of parliament should be allocated to each party as result of an election The divisor methods provide way of solving this problem by de ning notion of proportionality guided by some rounding rule Motivated by recent challenges in the context of electoral apportionment we consider the question of how to allocate the seats of parliament under parity constraints between candidate types equal number of men and women elected while at the same time satisfying party proportionality We consider two different approaches for this problem The rst mechanism that follows greedy approach corresponds to recent mechanism used in the Chilean Constitutional at Convention election We analyze this mechanism from theoretical point of view The second mechanism follows the idea of bi proportionality introduced by Balin ski and De mange Math Program Math Oper Res In contrast with the classic bi proportional method by Balin ski and De mange this mechanism is ruled by two levels of proportional it Proportionality is satis ed at the level of parties by means of divisor method and then bi proportionality is used to decide the number of candidates allocated to each type and party We provide theoretical analysis of this mechanism making progress on the the ret ical understanding of methods with two levels of proportionality typical benchmark used in the context of two dimensional apportionment is the fair share matrix scaling which corresponds to an ideal fractional bi proportional solution We provide lower bounds on the distance between these two types of solutions and we explore their consequences in the context of two dimensional apportionment CNRS IR IF Universit de Paris France claire mathieu ir if fr Institute of Engineering Sciences Universidad deO Higgins Chile victor verdugo oh cl

The Maxwell spectrum bifurcation on the Schwarz child black holes in cavity with vanishing energy ux boundary conditions Yun he Lei Meng jie Wang and Ji liang Jing Department of Physics and Syne get ic Innovation Center for Quantum Eec ts and Applications Hunan Normal University Changsha Hunan China Dated August We perform systematic study of the Maxwell quasi normal spectrum in mirror like cavity following the generic vanishing energy ux principle by starting with the Schwarz child black holes in this paper The vanishing energy ux principle leads to two die rent sets of boundary conditions and therefore two die rent sets of modes In pure cavity the Maxwell equations resolved analytically and we obtain two distinct sets of normal modes which is contradictory to the counterpart of the anti de Sitter AdS case For the case of black holes in cavity we solve the Maxwell equations numerically and the Maxwell spectrum is explored by varying the mirror radius the angular momentum quantum number cid and the overtone number In particular we proclaim that the Maxwell spectrum may bifurcate for both boundary conditions when the mirror is placed around the black hole event horizon which is analogous to the spectrum bifurcation eec ts found for the Maxwell lds on asymptotically AdS black holes This observation provides another example to exhibit the similarity between black holes in cavity and the AdS black holes

Accounting for scalar non Gaussian it in secondary gravitational waves Ra gave ndra Centre for Strings Gravitation and Cosmology Department of Physics Indian Institute of Technology Madras Chennai India It is well known that enhancement in the primordial scalar perturbations over small scales generate detectable amplitudes of secondary gravitational waves GW by sourcing the tensor perturbations at the second order These stochastic gravitational waves are expected to carry the imprints of the primordial non Gaussian ties The scalar bi spectrum that is typically produced in models of nation leading to sign cant secondary GW is non trivial and highly scale dependent In this work we present method to account for such general scale dependent scalar bi spectrum arising from nation ary models in the calculation of the spectral density of secondary GW Using this method on two spec ic models of nation driven by canonical scalar el we nd that the corrections arising from the bi spectrum to the power spectrum are not sign cant to leave detectable imprints on secondary GW Though the corrections may not be sign cant in the scenarios considered the method discussed is robust free from assumptions about the shape of the bi spectrum and generalizes earlier approaches adopted in the literature We argue that this method of accounting for scalar bi spectrum shall be helpful in future computations for exotic models generating larger amplitudes of scalar non Gaussian ties along with sign cant amount of secondary GW

The Structure and Incentives of OVID related Emergency Wage Subsidy Jules Linden Cathal ODon og hue Denis Solo gon National University Ireland Galway Ireland Luxembourg Institute of Socio Economic Research LISE Abstract During recent crisis wage subsidies played major role in sheltering firms and households from economic shocks During OVID most workers were affected and many liberal welfare states introduced new temporary wage subsidies to protected workers earnings and employment across the income distribution OECD New wage subsidies however marked departure from the structure of traditional income support payments and required reform This paper uses simulated datasets to assess the structure and incentives of the Irish OVID wage subsidy scheme CW under five designs We use now casting approach to update micro data producing near real time picture of the labour market at the peak of the OVID crisis Using micro simulation modelling we assess the impact of different designs on income replacement work incentives and income inequality We find that changes in design substantially affected the functioning of the scheme Our findings suggest that pro rata designs support middle earners more and flat rate designs support low earners more We find evidence for strong work disincentive under all designs though flat rate designs perform better Disincentive are primarily driven by generous unemployment payments and changes in work related costs Matching the structure of the unemployment payment and the wage subsidy only partially addresses work disincentive The impact of design on income inequality largely depends on the generosity of payments Earnings related pro rata designs were associated to higher market earnings inequality The difference in inequality levels fall however once benefits taxes and work related costs are taking into consideration In our discussion we turn to transaction costs the rationale for reform and reintegration of the emergency wage subsidy We find some support for the claim that design changes were motivated by political considerations We suggest that establishing permanent wage subsidies based on sector al turnover rules could offer enhanced protection to middle and high earners during emergencies and reduce uncertainty the need for costly reform and the risk of politically motivated designs Keywords emergency response wage subsidy OVID micro simulation policy design EL codes The Authors are grateful to the Irish Health Research Board Irish Research Council and the Luxembourg Fond National de la Recherche NR AFR Individual for funding this research Corresponding Author Jules Linden email jules linden lise lu
